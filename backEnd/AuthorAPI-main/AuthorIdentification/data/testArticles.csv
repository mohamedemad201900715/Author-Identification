AaronPressman,"Legislation to dramatically relax U.S. export restrictions on computer encoding technology moved ahead on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee approved the measure.
The bill, known as the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act, now goes to the House International Relations Committee where opponents plan to make their stand.
Encryption, computer programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" has become an essential component of global communications and electronic commerce over the Internet.
The Clinton administration has opposed the bill and similiar measures in the Senate, arguing that allowing strong encryption out of the country will put it in the hands of international criminals and terrorists.
Representative Bob Goodlatte, the bill's author, said he had spoken to administration officials on Tuesday and hoped a compromise could be reached.
""We're very, very close in many areas,"" the Virginia Republican told reporters after the committee vote. ""The export control issue is probably the area that we're still the furthest apart on.""
Goodlatte's bill would also write into law the current policy of allowing unrestricted domestic use of encryption.
The bill would criminalize the use of encryption to conceal information related to the commission of a felony. That provision came on an amendment from Massachusetts Democrat Representative William Delahunt which replaced a broader criminalization provision included in the original bill.
The committee also approved an amendment requiring law enforcement officials to compile statistics for Congress on the use of encryption by criminals.
Software industry officials and privacy advocates, who have strongly opposed the export limits, urged lawmakers to continue moving the legislation forward.
The International Relations Committee ""will have a go at it but it's great to have some momentum,"" Netscape Communications Corp. public policy counsel Peter Harter said after the vote. ""We've come a long way in a very short period of time. This legislation is moving at Internet time.""
Jonah Seiger, communications director at the Centre for Democracy and Technology, said the vote was a ""historic moment.""
""The Judiciary Committee agreed that the administration has the wrong policy sending a very clear signal that we need to change direction,"" Seiger said.
Before the vote, committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois prohibited amendments to the bill on the controversial export section. Hyde said the export section fell under the jurisdiction of the International Relations Committee.
"
AaronPressman,"Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker on Wednesday tangled with lawmakers who opposed his view that banks should not be allowed to combine with commercial companies.
But neither side broke much new ground in the debate, one of the hottest controversies remaining as Congress tries to overhaul ageing U.S. financial laws.
Volcker may have set the tone when he began his remarks to the House Banking Committee by observing that he delivered almost the identical testimony at a similiar hearing in 1991.
""I could read that statement word-for-word and it would be totally relevant"" on most issues being discussed, he said.
Volcker, a long-time opponent of mixing commerce and banking, pointed to recent experiences in Japan and Germany.
""I do not think that today many observers look to Germany or Japan for a model of an effective, innovative banking system,"" he said, ""Quite the contrary.""
That suited committee chairman Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, also a longtime opponent of mixing banking and commerce. Rep. Doug Bereuter, Republican of Nebraska, announced at the hearing he would oppose such combinations.  
But advocates of legislation allowing some mixing questioned Volcker's evidence and conclusions.
Rep. Richard Baker, who has introduced a bill to allow unlimited mixing, said banks had been permitted to combine with commercial firms for most of U.S. history.
""This reflects that there is no principle or meaningful distinction between commerce and finance,"" the Louisiana Republican said.
Baker noted that Bankers Trust New York Corp, where Volcker sits on the board of directors, reported a profit of $62 million last year on an equity investment in an airline, asking: ""Isn't that an investment in a commercial enterprise?""
""Banks are able to hold some equity investment in the course of underwriting and in the course of merchant banking, and Bankers Trust has done so at times,"" Volcker responded. ""Had they extended beyond that, they would have one director who would protest.""
Banks cannot hold a controlling stake in a commercial firm, Volcker added.
When Baker suggested that lawmakers would put similar limits on commercial holdings at consolidated financial firms, referred to as a basket approach, Volcker disagreed.  
One bill under consideration would allow financial firms to conduct 25 percent of their business in non-financial endeavors, although legislators have also discussed basing the basket limit on total capital as opposed to business activity.
The ban on control ""is not a basket at all, it is a non- controlling interest and if it reached the point where it affected the fortunes of the bank, I'd worry about,"" Volcker said.
Later, Rep. Tom Campbell, Republican of California, said he was leaning towards allowing combinations of banks and commercial firms.
Representatives of the securities and insurance industries testified after Volcker and most favored allowing banking and commerce to mix.
""Such combinations are today part of the normal course of business for Merrill Lynch as well as other companies in our industry here in the U.S. and around the world,"" John Heinmann, the firm's chairman of global financial institutions, said.

AaronPressman,"Sun Microsystem Inc's decision to use powerful computer encoding software made in Russia put added pressure on the Clinton administration on Monday to relax strict U.S. export controls on similiar products made by American companies.
Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" have become a critical component of global communications and online commerce over the Internet.  
But encryption's power to prevent hackers from snooping on telephone calls and credit card numbers sent over the Internet can also be employed by drug cartels or terrorists to thwart law enforcement survellience.
Clinton administration officials oppose allowing exports of powerful U.S. encryption programs unless the software is designed to allow the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys.
Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh and others have said repeatedly that the encryption ""genie"" is not yet ""out of the bottle.""  
""It's an arguably legal way around what is clearly a ludicrous export control policy of the administration that is creating jobs in Russia,"" Rep. Bob Goodlatte said in a telephone interview.
Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, introduced one of several measures being considered by Congress to relax the export controls. The bill was passed by the House Judiciary Committee last week and is awaiting action by the International Relations Committee.
If U.S. export restrictions stay in place, industry officials warned, other companies will go the same route.
""A lot of U.S. companies have been contemplating this,"" said Jon Englund, vice president at the Information Technology Association of America. ""Sun's move is the first example of a trend that will continue. We'll see more and more of that.""
Administration officials had no comment on the Sun announcement.

AaronPressman,"The Clinton administration has crafted a plan to reform what many call outdated U.S. banking laws and will begin making its positions known over the next few weeks, industry officials said Monday.
The administration will formally unveil its plan when Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testifies at a House Banking Committee hearing June 3, but details of the plan are expected to emerge as early as this week, the officials said.
Under Secretary John Hawke, a leading architect of the administration plan, is slated to speak here on Wednesday. In his speech, Hawke may indicate the administration's stand on mixing banking and commerce, lobbyists said.
""Mr. Hawke certainly won't do anything to upstage Rubin,"" one lobbyist in contact with the administration noted. ""But we will hear generally where they are on some of these topics.""
While most in Congress and the finance industry agree that the Depression-era barriers separating banking from securities and insurance should be torn down, there is little consensus about going farther and allowing banks to combine with securities and other firms.
The administration's position has evolved over the past several months. A task force on financial reform headed by Hawke initially recommended eliminating all barriers.
But the specter of Citicorp or Chase Manhattan merging with General Motors Corp. or Microsoft Corp. drew strong protests from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach of Iowa, as well as prominent labor and consumer groups.
And during the spring, several Democratic senators, led by Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, wrote to Rubin to register their opposition to mixing banking and commerce.
Bowing somewhat to the criticism, the administration is now said to favor allowing limited combinations. Financial firms would be limited to a ""basket"" of non-financial activity, expressed as a percentage of total revenue or capital, some lobbyists said.
But the basket could be further limited by prohibiting combinations of the largest financial and non-financial firms. For example, one approach would be to bar the 1,000 biggest commercial firms from owning or being owned by banks.
Another difficult issue concerns regulating disparate financial businesses within a diversified firm.
Almost everyone favors ""functional regulation,"" meaning that each activity of a firm would be regulated by the appropriate regulator. The Securities and Exchange Commission would regulate securities activities while state insurance regulators would oversee insurance sales, for example.
But debate continues about the level of federal intrusion in insurance regulation as well as the need for a top-level regulator to oversee entire firms.
While some favor setting the Federal Reserve at the top of the heap, the administration is expected to back a committee approach. The committee would be composed of representatives of the various functional regulators.

AaronPressman,"Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, outlining a plan to overhaul Depression-era laws governing the U.S. financial sector, said Wednesday the Clinton administration favored allowing banks to enter the securities and insurance fields.
""The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared,"" Rubin said in a speech here.
The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress. ""We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative,"" Rubin said.
Increased competition in financial services should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, Rubin said.
The new proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.
""Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus, we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach,"" Rubin said.
Some lawmakers, along with smaller banks and consumer groups, adamantly oppose allowing banks to combine with commercial firms. But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.
Rubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.
Under a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with  commercial firms.
If banks are allowed to mix with commercial firms, the reforms could take effect two years after enactment, Rubin said. If mixing is not allowed, the reforms could take effect in nine months.
The Federal Reserve should continue to oversee bank holding companies, while specific activities would be overseen by specific regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators.
Banks would be allowed to underwrite municipal revenue bonds. An exemption for banks in the federal mutual fund law, the Investment Company Act, would be narrowed.
"
AaronPressman,"The U.S. Commerce Department showed an unexpected degree of flexibility in approving an application from Sybase Inc to export computer encoding products, company officials said on Wednesday.
About a dozen companies have already gotten permission this year to export products with encryption, data scrambling technology that renders information unreadable without a password or software ""key.""
But Sybase's products appeared to skirt strict U.S. export rules in effect since the beginning of the year.  
""I was sufficiently surprised when I got word over the phone that we had been approved that I wrote a letter spelling out what I saw as the differences of our approach versus (the regulations),"" said Tom Parenty, Sybase's director of data and communication security. Shortly thereafter, Parenty said, he received written confirmation.
To export powerful encryption under the current rules, a company must include features allowing the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys. Companies may export medium-strength encryption by promising to include so-called key recovery features within two years.  
The rules indicate that a product must allow key recovery both for encrypted stored data, like a file on a hard drive, as well as for live communications that are encoded.
But Sybase's products, Internet transaction software and client-server database programs, will allow for key recovery within two years only of stored data. Encrypted communications between a customer and a web site using the Sybase transaction software, for example, would not allow for government decoding, Parenty said.
The key recovery feature was designed to meet the needs of customers, he said.  
""Many people want a key recovery mechanism for stored data,"" Parenty said. ""But there is no reason, once I have the answer to my query, to want the keys to decrypt those communications.""
Sybase still supports legislative proposals that Congress is considering that would eliminate most of the export restrictions, Parenty said.
The Clinton administration has opposed loosening the rules, but pressure for change continued to mount this week, as Sun Microsystems Inc announced it would get around the rules by marketing Russian-made encryption with its export products.
And on Wednesday, a group of cryptography experts released a study concluding that the large-scale infrastructure needed to support key recovery for law enforcement agencies could compromise the security of lawful encryption users.

AaronPressman,"Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined on Wednesday the Clinton administration's plan to allow banks to get into the securities and insurance businesses, eliminating 60-year-old legal barriers enacted during the Great Depression.
""The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared,"" Rubin said.
The plan would allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to compete directly under a uniform set of regulations. That increased competition should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, Rubin said in a speech at the Exchequer Club here.
The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress. ""We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative,"" Rubin said.
House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach welcomed the plan, but said some substantive issues were unresolved.
""While differences of judgment on several key legislative points remain, Secretary Rubin's statement today is very constructive to the process,"" the Iowa Republican said.
Industry participants said the administration plan would give the reform effort a needed boost.
The proposal ""should provide considerable momentum for long-needed reform,"" Bankers Trust New York Corp. Chairman Frank Newman said. Newman gave the effort some prior momentum last month, when his bank took advantage of recent regulatory changes and acquired the securities firm Alex. Brown Inc.
Consumer advocates, however, complained that the proposal did not contain adequate measures to protect bank customers buying insurance.
""We're very disappointed that there are no protections on insurance,"" Mary Griffin of Consumers Union said. Banks have a weak track record in that area, she added.
Credit insurance on mortgages, the second most popular insurance product sold by banks, ""is one of the biggest consumer rip-offs out there,"" she said.
The Rubin proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.
""Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus, we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach,"" Rubin said.

AaronPressman,"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged lawmakers on Thursday to put off consideration of controversial proposals that would allow banks to merge with commercial companies, such as carmakers.
Instead, he said Congress should press ahead with more modest financial reforms that would knock down the 60-year-old legal barriers that prevent banks from affiliating with insurance companies and securities firms.
""Congress should widen the permissible range of affiliations for banking organizations in order to expand the choices for consumers and increase the efficiency of financial markets,"" Greenspan told the House Banking Committee.
Technology and free-market competition are blurring the boundries between financial and non-financial companies, but Congress can afford to wait, Greenspan said.
""Any wider authorization of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernization,"" he said. ""Were we to move forward, it is truly irreversible.""
Greenspan's position reflected an evolution of the Fed's view since February when he last testified on reforming the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. At that time, Greenspan urged caution, but backed a transitional approach allowing limited mixing.
Since then, numerous lawmakers, small bankers and a host of interest groups, including consumer and labor organizations, have voiced opposition to allowing such combinations.
They complained that allowing a company like Microsoft Corp. or General Motors Corp. to own a major bank would diminish competition and could bias lending decisions.
Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach, an ardent opponent of mixing banking and commerce, said there was no public support for allowing commercial companies to own banks.
""I think that's going too far,"" the Iowa Republican said.
Rep. Marge Roukema, who has introduced a bill that would allow banking and commerce combinations, said she was disappointed by Greenspan's testimony.
Because savings and loans institutions are allowed to combine with commercial firms under current law, not including banking and commerce in new legislation leaves ""an enormous loophole,"" said Roukema, Republican of New Jersey.
Analysts said Roukema's observation was critical to understanding why Congress has been unable to modernize bank law, despite repeated efforts over the past decade.
""It's already out there,"" said Karen Shaw Petrou, president of bank consulting firm ISD/Shaw Inc., referring to the savings and loan authority. ""That's always been the stumbling block and if you take it away, people will get mad and Congress doesn't deal with that very well.""
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the Clinton administration's bank plan, but sidestepped the controversial banking and commerce question. Instead, he offered Congress two alternatives -- one that would allow such combinations and another that would not.

Greenspan acknowledged that the barriers separating banks and commercial companies will eventually crumble with the continued advance of technology.

Congress and the banking industry have been working to reform the law for more than a decade without success. But this year, previous opponents of reform have come to the table as regulators and courts have chipped away at the law and granted banks some new powers.
"
AaronPressman,"The Clinton administration gave a solid boost this week to congressional efforts to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws but substantial hurdles remain, participants in the debate said.
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the administration's plan to eliminate the 1933 Glass-Steagall legal barriers separating banks from securities firms and insurance companies.
The administration plan was due to Congress by March 31 and the nearly two-month delay had some lobbyists fearing that the administration would avoid the tangled regulatory controversies and not submit anything.
Congress has sought to reform banking laws for more than a decade, but one interest group or another has always managed to block passage of legislation. In prior years, banks sought reform, while other financial firms opposed change.
Recently, courts and regulators have granted banks new authority, however. That brought insurance companies and securities firms to the table to seek a level playing field.
""There is renewed hope that the 105th Congress will tackle this difficult issue,"" said David Farmer, lobbyist for the Alliance of American Insurers, after Rubin's speech.
The action now shifts to the Banking committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate, where detailed reform measures will be drafted. Rubin will provide more details of the Clinton plan in testimony before Congress on June 3.
House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach said this week that drafting will begin immediately after that testimony and that he wants committee action completed by mid-June.
It is at the drafting stage where some past efforts to reform banking laws have foundered as competing interests fought over the details.
The new administration proposal ducked one of the most contentious issues -- whether banks should be allowed to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.
Instead of taking sides, Rubin offered two alternatives. Under one plan, banks would be allowed a limited amount of commercial activity, but the largest 1,000 commercial companies could not own or be owned by banks.
Under a second alternative, the current prohibition would be continued, but the current exception allowing savings and loans to be owned by commercial companies would also be maintained.
Several months ago, administration officials were discussing proposals to allow nearly unlimited mixing of banking and commerce. The apparent retreat left advocates of greater mixing fuming.
""Their recommendation is tantamount to surrender on the issue,"" Minnesota Democrat Rep. Bruce Vento said.
Vento and New Jersey Republican Rep. Marge Roukema introduced a bill in January that would allow banks to have a ""basket"" of commercial activity accounting for up to 25 percent of an institution's total business.
Another blow to Vento and Roukema's efforts came Thursday when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House Banking Committee.
Greenspan said Congress should eliminate Glass-Steagall now, but put off the banking and commerce issue for future review. ""Any wider authorization of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernization,"" he said.
Now the banking and commerce issue threatens to derail their backing, said bank consultant Karen Shaw Petrou, president of ISD/Shaw Inc.
""The administration's plan is a decent baby-step,"" Petrou said. ""But unsurprisingly, it's not the lightning bolt that transforms the debate.""
Securities firms and insurance companies are involved in commercial activity, but want to get into banking if banks are allowed into their fields.
""If you don't allow banking and commerce, then you create obstacles for non-banks,"" Petrou said. ""But somebody's twist or turn to solve that then creates another problem for someone else.""
Even a small percentage limit on commercial activity would accommodate the largest non-bank financial companies, according to research from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released on Thursday.
Among the seven securities firms in the Fortune 1000, plus Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., none earned much more than 5 percent of their revenue from commercial activity in 1996, the FDIC estimated.
Only one of the five largest life and health insurers and one of the five largest property and casualty firms exceeded the 5 percent level, the FDIC said.
Four of the 10 largest diversified financial firms would exceed the 5 percent level, however. American Express derived 9 to 14 percent of its revenue from commercial activities, for example, and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc. had 28 percent of revenues from commerce.

AaronPressman,"Scientists working on the next generation of the Internet are finding their first challenge is to convince a sceptical U.S. Congress to fund the project.
Rather than stumbling over new hardware or software, the next generation network has quickly run into several road blocks on Capitol Hill.
On Tuesday, scientists involved with the project, including President Bill Clinton's top science adviser John Gibbons, will try to soothe concerns at a Senate hearing.
Some lawmakers are worried that the project lacks focus and is not sufficiently different from a related university project known as Internet2.
The next generation Internet project, announced with great fanfare by Clinton during last year's presidential campaign, aims to send data at 1,000 times the speed of today's net. Higher speed and improved reliability could spur a host of new uses for the network, some with sound and video.
Clinton pledged the government would spend $100 million annually for five years to build the super high-speed network and promote its use.
The money was to come from reallocating existing research funds, but that plan is already in trouble. In April, the House of Representatives passed a budget for the National Science Foundation that specifically barred any spending on the next generation Internet.
The bill is awaiting action by the Senate and could be modified before going to the president's desk.
In May, 28 senators sent a letter to science adviser Gibbons complaining about the composition of the next generation Internet's advisory board. The senators, from both political parties but all from rural states, noted that the board's 20 members came from only eight states.
""Instead of a potentially major positive development, therefore, 'Next Generation Internet' and Internet2 becomes a significant source of concern for us,"" the senators wrote in the letter obtained by Reuters.
National Science Foundation officials are confident that the programme will go forward. ""Next Generation Internet is a presidential initiative that will have a lot of congressional involvement,"" NSF spokeswoman Elizabeth Gaston said.
Congressional staffers said for the time being they remained confused about the administration's priorities. ""Everyone I speak with tells me different things about what these programmes are supposed to do, and which agencies get which portions of the budget,"" one staffer said.
To some degree, the confusion reflects the changing fortunes of the Internet. While the original Internet, including connections to universities, was largely funded by government, this time around higher education and industry are more likely to foot some of the bill.
More than 100 schools have pledged to spend $50 million a year on Internet2, mainly for higher speed connections and switches. The schools are also seeking corporate sponsorship.
Less government involvement for building the plumbing frees up more resources for cutting-edge research, according to George Strawn, director of the NSF's division of networking and communications research.
""The first time around, the NSF sort of had to take the lead to diffuse it to all of higher education because there wasn't an industry yet,"" Strawn said. ""Now that there is, as soon as it becomes cost effective we've got peddlers out there who will find higher education a receptive customer.""
The original Internet began as a Defence Department project called ARPAnet to link far-flung computer centres. Funded mostly by the government until the mid-1980s, the net is now run almost entirely by private companies including MCI Communications Corp, Sprint Corp and BBN Corp.
Representatives from those companies gathered with other stars of the Internet community in Virginia two weeks ago for a ""next generation"" planning meeting. Some will return to Washington next week to explain the project to Congress.
"
AaronPressman,"Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin goes to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to further explain the Clinton administration's bank reform plan, but lawmakers are likely to focus foremost on what the plan left out.
The Clinton proposal, along with several pending bills, would scrap the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act's separation of banking from other financial services.
On the contentious issue of going further and allowing banks to combine with commercial firms, however, the administration ducked.  
Instead, the Clinton plan unveiled by Rubin on May 21, offered two alternatives and left the hard choice to Congress.
""We think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress,"" the secretary said as he announced the plan.
Congress has debated overhauling antiquated U.S. banking laws for more than a decade without success and some analysts suggest the banking and commerce issue will sidetrack this year's attempts.
At Tuesday's House Banking Committee hearing, opponents of mixing banking and commerce led by committee chairman and Iowa Republican Jim Leach will try to steer Rubin to examine the risks of unlimited mergers.
Proponents, including subcommittee chairpersons Marge Roukema and Richard Baker, Republicans from New Jersey and Louisiana respectively, will take the opposite tack.
Under one of the two alternative outlined by Rubin last month, limited mixing would be permitted but excluding the 1,000 or so largest nonfinancial firms, measured by asset size.  
Bank holding companies could derive ""some significant percentage"" of their gross revenues from commercial activity under the approach, referred to as a basket limitation.
Under the second alternative, the current prohibition on mixing would be maintained but the current exception allowing commercial firms to own savings and loan institutions would also be maintained.
The administration chose to walk a fine line on the issue after Democratic legislators and traditionally Democratic labor and consumer groups came out against combining banking and commerce.
On Monday, other opponents including small bankers and agriculture groups issued a statement against even limited mixing of banking and commerce.
""Say NO to those who would undermine the world's strongest and most dynamic economic and financial system,"" the groups said. The 31 signers of the statement ranged from the National Bankers Association to the National Bakers Association.
Some lawmakers also plan to raise concerns at the hearing that portions of the Clinton plan contain loopholes that would render any limitations on banking and commerce irrelevent, staffers said.  
Any firm could own a thrift and establish a so-called wholesale financial institution. Wholesale banks could only accepts deposits over $100,000, would not be covered by deposit insurance, but would have access to the Federal Reserve's electronic payment system.
""The way the wholesale institution is structured would allow enormous activity,"" one staffer said. ""It's a big loophole.""
The notion of allowing savings and loans to continue operating under different rules than banks is also likely to draw some criticism.
Under legislation passed by Congress last year to recapitalize the savings industry's deposit insurance fund, the Clinton administration was directed to report on how the legal charters of the two industries could be merged.

AaronPressman,"The heads of 10 leading U.S. high-technology companies descended on Washington Wednesday to lobby for stronger laws protecting their products from piracy.
Executives including Microsoft Corp Chairman Bill Gates and Intel Corp Chairman Andrew Grove met with senators in the morning, reporters in the afternoon, and Vice President Al Gore and Commerce Secretary William Daley later in the day. They came armed with fresh research indicating that the software industry has been a key factor boosting economic growth.  
""The PC software industry is a very fast growing, very innovative business,"" Gates told reporters. ""Government statisics don't accurately capture all the things going on.""
According to research done for the Business Software Alliance, the industry totaled $102.8 billion in 1996, directly employing 619,000 people and paying wages of $36.4 billion. Another 1.4 million American workers owed their jobs indirectly to the industry.
The industry has grown at a rate of 12.5 percent annually since 19890, more than twice as fast as the U.S. economy, the study concluded.
To spur further gains, the software executives urged political leaders to strengthen international laws protecting intellectual property,
Piracy cost the industry $11.2 billion in 1996, the report noted. Although a considerable proportion of the piracy occurred in China, the software executives said they favored extending most favored nation status to China.
Government could also promote software sales by relaxing strict export limits on computer encoding technology, the executives said.
Encryption software, which scrambles information and renders it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" was the realm of spies and generals. But the technology has become an increasingly critical security component of electronic commerce and global communications networks.
While U.S. companies cannot export powerful encryption products, foreign companies are cleaning up, the executives warned. Last month, for example, Sun Microsystems said it would market an encryption program made in Russia with some of its products to evade the export limits.
""The cat's already out of the bag,"" Novell Inc Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said. U.S. law should be modified to allow export of any encryption product already available abroad, he said.
Intel's Grove said fast moving technology companies sometimes get frustrated working with more sedate pace of government. ""We have been asked to exercise patience,"" Grove said. ""Patience is not one of our virtues.""

AaronPressman,"U.S. lawmakers redrafting a legislative proposal to modernize U.S. banking laws will rely heavily on the Clinton administration's reform plan, congressional staffers said on Wednesday.
But whatever provisions end up in the new draft, expected to be finished by Friday, the real battle will be fought when the House Banking Committee begins its formal consideration, or mark up, of the proposal currently scheduled for next week.  
""The goal here is to get in the (bill) those areas where there is general agreement,"" committee spokesman David Runkel said.
""The intent is to use as much of the Treasury (Department's) language as appropriate,"" Runkel said. The most controversial questions will be resolved as lawmakers offer varied amendments during the mark up, he added.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin unveiled the administration's plan to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws in a speech on May 21.  
In testimony on Tuesday, Rubin urged Congress to scrap the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and free banks to enter other financial sectors like insurance and securities underwriting.
At least four major areas of disagreement remain that will be the focus of the scheduled June 11 mark up, staffers said. Some lawmakers want the mark up delayed at least a week, however, so the session could be delayed.
First, wide differences of opinion exist among legislators about whether financial firms should be allowed to engage in nonfinancial, commercial activities. The administration ducked the difficult question, offering two alternatives instead.  
Three earlier bills also each took a different approach and numerous alternatives have been floated in recent weeks. ""You'll see it all at the mark up,"" one staffer predicted.
Also, the insurance industry is up in arms about provisions in the administration plan that may broaden a 1996 Supreme Court decision limiting state regulation of bank insurance sales. The bill would allow federal bank regulators to overrule state insurance authorities in some instances.
""This could have the effect of threatening the safety and soundness of the nation's insurance system,"" said David Pratt, senior vice president of the American Insurance Association.  
A third controversey sprouted from one of the administration's two ""alternatives"" on banking and commerce.
The plan said Congress could allow limited mixing or keep the current prohibition while also maintaining the present exception allowing commercial companies to own thrifts.
Under the second option, thrifts and banks would continue to operate under different federal charters. That outraged the banking industry, which thought it made a deal last year guaranteeing the charters would be merged.  
""A very critical piece if the puzzle will be that any financial reform measure specifically deals with the thrift charter issue,"" said Beth Climo, group director of financial industry affairs at the American Bankers Association.
""That is the fundamental thing that needs to be addressed,"" Climo said.
Another area of disagreement surrounds proposals to allow creation of so-called wholesale financial institutions, or ""woofies."" These bank-like entities could only take deposits over $100,000 and would not receive deposit insurance.
Some opponents of mixing banking and commerce fear that wholesale banks represent a significant loophole, since a commercial company could set up a ""woofie.""
Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach said earlier this week that he hoped to have the committee approve a bill and send it to the House floor by July 4.
But even if a majority of the banking panel can reach a consensus, the bill will be sequentially referred to the House Commerce Committee. That committee could then hold its own mark up or even stall the legislation.

AaronPressman,"The International Monetary Fund opened a site on the Internet Thursday providing information about the types of economic data available in 18 member countries.
""For a long time we have been trying to press countries to report to us on a more timely basis, more information, and based on good statistical systems,"" said Jack Boorman, director of the IMF's policy and review department.
The 1994-95 Mexican peso crisis highlighted the need for timely and accurate data about developing countries, Boorman told a news conference.
The site does not include the countries' actual data -- that may come later -- but it lists contacts for obtaining the information.
""Good statistical citizenship helps to inform markets,"" Boorman said. ""The whole purpose of this system is to help that process, to make sure that markets are getting better data in a timely way.""
The Internet address of the site is http://dsbb.imf.org. It lists information such as the frequency, schedule and types of economic and financial data released on a regular basis by the countries which have subscribed to the fund's ""Special Data Dissemination Standard.""
The countries on the site are Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Slovenia, Switzerland, Thailand, Britain and the United States.
By next week, information about another eight countries is expected to be added. Those countries are Croatia, France, Hungary, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Sweden and Turkey.
Another eight countries have subscribed to the data standard but are not ready to go online. Those are Austria, Australia, Belgium, Chile, Columbia, Iceland, Israel, and Lithuania.
The special standard is being phased in over two years. countries agreed to meet the standards by Dec. 31, 1998.
Discussions are continuing with other countries that have not yet agreed to subscribe, including Germany, said John McLenaghan, director of the IMF statistics department.
IMF officials said the site could eventually include direct links to countries' data or other kinds of information.
""We're starting something which, while it has a very specific content and frame at the present time, has potential for going in directions that none of us perhaps quite see at the present time,"" Boorman said.

AaronPressman,"The number of consumers and businesses filing for U.S. bankruptcy protection continued a dramatic rise, hitting a record 335,073 in the first quarter of 1997, the American Bankruptcy Institute said Tuesday.
The first quarter total, the fifth straight quarterly record, was up 26 percent from 266,149 in the first quarter of last year, the non-partisan research group noted.
Consumers filed more than 321,000 of the first quarter petitions, about 96 percent of the total and a rise of 27 percent from a year earlier.
""The continued record pace of bankruptcies tracks the sustained growth in consumer spending and debt,"" said the group's executive director, Samuel Gerdano said.
After consumer filings surpassed the 1 million mark for the first time last year, the first quarter's pace ""suggests that 1997 will surpass the 1996 record,"" he said.
The quarter's bankruptcy surge has already hit some consumer lenders.  Credit card giant Advanta Corp. shocked Wall Street when it reported a loss of 43 cents a share for the first quarter.
""Credit card debt is playing a big role in bankruptcy trends,"" said George Salem, banking industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co. in New York. And bankruptcies, in turn, have been depressing credit card company profits, Salem said.
""It's like continuing to be punched and it's going to be a while before it stops,"" Salem said.  Card issuers are cutting back on lending and tightening underwriting standards, but the current problems result from loans made more than a year ago, he said.
Looking at the 12 months ended March 31, 1997, Hawaii had the largest increase in bankruptcies, with a 61 percent jump. The northern section of West Virginia followed closely behind with a 60 percent rise.
About 70 percent of consumers filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, where unsecured debt is wiped out and the debtor is allowed to keep some property.
Some card companies maintain that more consumers should be forced to file for Chapter 13 reorganizations, where debts are not wiped out but must be repaid over several years.
Visa USA said this week that its analysis of bankruptcy petitions showed that mounting credit card debt was not responsible for the rise in bankruptcies.
""This analysis refutes the notion that bank credit cards are largely responsible for the increase,"" Visa USA Senior Vice President Kenneth Crone said.
Crone said the analysis showed people with an ability to repay some of their debts were filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. ""People who can repay a portion of their debts should be required to do so,"" he said. ""Until this changes, lenders and consumers will continue to foot the bill.""
But consumer groups disputed the Visa findings and said excessive credit card debt was directly implicated.
""They are not making the correct comparisons,"" said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. ""The only two figures that really matter are the average income and average credit card debt of bankrupt people.""
Among people who file for Chapter 7, the average income was about $20,000 and the average credit card debt was about $17,000, Brobeck said.
"
AaronPressman,"Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato on Wednesday introduced legislation to prohibit banks from charging additional fees to non-customers who use their automated teller machines.
About 54 percent of all automated teller machines now impose a surcharge on non-customers, according to a survey by the General Accounting Office released by D'Amato at a congressional hearing.
""ATM's were supposed to reduce costs, and the savings could be passed on to consumers,"" the New York Republican said. ""Now, banks are suddenly claiming that ATM's are no longer cost-effective.""
""They have decided to soak consumers with multiple fees every time they need to take money out of their accounts,"" D'Amato said.
Consumer groups urged lawmakers to enact the ban. Surcharges pose a serious competitive threat to smaller banks, which have fewer automated teller machines, according to Edmund Mierzwinski, programme director at the non-profit U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
""If enough small bank customers switch accounts to big banks to avoid surcharges, then the big banks, facing less competition, will raise the fees they charge their own customers even more,"" Mierzwinski said.
After the hearing, banks denied the fees amount to double-dipping and argued consumers benefit from the proliferation of ATMs made possible by surcharge revenues.
""The marketplace is at work,"" said Ed Yingling, executive director of the American Bankers Association. ""Consumers, not the government, should decide if they are willing to pay for the convenience of using ATMs at thousands of new locations.""
If surcharges are banned, many newly installed machines would be shuttered, Yingling said.
Until last year, the two largest ATM network operators, Mastercard International's Cirrus and Visa USA's Plus, generally prohibited banks from levying surcharges on non-customers. Banks received a portion of the fee on such transactions charged by the customer's own bank.
Last April, Cirrus and Plus began allowing ATM surcharges, and the fees have rapidly proliferated. Fifteen states, including Texas, had previously allowed surcharges. More recently, Connecticut and Iowa have passed legislation banning surcharges.
The GAO found that about one-third of banks impose surcharges, covering 54 percent of all teller machines in the country. From the end of 1995 to February 1997, the number of ATMs rose 34 percent, while the number imposing a surcharge rose 320 percent, the GAO said.
The average surcharge was $1.14 in 1997, up from 99 cents in 1995.
Not all the senators at Wednesday's hearing favoured legislation banning surcharges. Sen. Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, said he preferred allowing the market to set ATM fees.
""The ATM surcharge is a convenience fee,"" Faircloth said. ""That convenience comes at a price.""
"
AlanCrosby,"The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) issued forecasts for 1997 on Monday predicting a slight economic upturn, but analysts issued warnings about the rapidly growing trade and current account deficits.
After a sluggish 1996, the CSU said it expected real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 1997 of 4.0-5.0 percent following an estimated 4.1 percent in 1996. Average annual inflation should ease to 7.5-8.0 percent from 8.8 percent, it forecast.
The CSU added in its wide range of forecasts that the current account deficit, spurred by a spiralling trade gap, should grow to 137-145 billion crowns from an estimated 110.6 billion crown ($4 billion) shortfall in 1996.
Analysts said the figures were more or less in line with expectations, but said that the widening current account and trade deficits -- both seen growing to record levels in 1997 -- could undermine the economy.
""I think they are credible forecasts, but not very encouraging,"" said David Lubin, an economist at HSBC Midland.
""It's okay for a country to run a current account deficit of nine percent of GDP but only if you believe in the future the economy will generate trade surpluses big enough to repay the debt that's being accumulated to finance the deficits,"" he told Reuters.
According to the CSU estimates, the current account shortfall should be 8.6-9.1 percent of GDP in 1997. It forecast the trade deficit would widen to 202-212 billion crowns from a deficit of 160.3 billion last year.
At the heart of the trade gap was a 12.7 percent rise in imports in 1996, due largely to firms investing in new machinery and materials which are badly needed for post-communist economic restructuring.
Exports stagnated, rising only 3.5 percent for the year. But the CSU said it expected them to grow 4.5-6.5 percent in 1997, while import growth should ease slightly to 9-12 percent.
""Some improvement (in imports) can be expected only in the second half of 1997 due to the influence of investment in new technologies and some pro-export measures,"" the CSU said.
But analysts say it is still too soon to know if the vast imports of machinery and materials in 1996 will be properly put to use, and whether managers can make their new capital goods translate into a more competitive industrial sector and cover the deficit currently being run up.
""I'm not sure that the Czech economy is making sufficient progress at the corporate level, the micro-economic level, to generate those trade surpluses,"" said one local economist.
""It seems to me that the Czech economy still has a sort of fundamental competitiveness problem,"" he added.
After fighting through a recent downturn, the Czech Republic's largest trading partner, Germany, appears poised to make a recovery in 1997. Government officials have often said that this should help sagging Czech exports.
But if the German economy does warm up, the Bundesbank may raise interest rates to keep it from overheating, attracting back funds which have flooded into the Czech Republic and bolstered its capital account.
""What they gain on the current account on the balance of payments from the German upturn, they might lose somewhat on the capital account,"" Lubins said.
The CSU said growth in average nominal wages -- a factor the central bank has said must be brought under control if inflation targets are to be met -- is expected to be 14.5-16.5 percent, down from the 1996 forecast increase of 18.4 percent.
Some analysts, however, said the drop might not be enough to stem inflationary pressures.
""This (wage growth) is much more than this economy can afford -- maybe around 12 percent is acceptable,"" said Vladimir Kriedl, an economist at Patria Finance.

AlanCrosby,"The Czech crown, boosted recently by demand brought about by a wave of Eurobond issues, is showing no sign of losing strength, prompting market speculation on Wednesday of possible central bank intervention.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) has said it is monitoring the development of the crown, but is prepared to allow the market to decide its rate within the fluctuation band.
Since the start of 1997 the currency has gained some three percentage points against its fixing basket, mainly on foreign buying to finance a wave of some 30 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) in new crown Eurobond issues.
Analysts said that while the crown may hold steady over the next day or two, it should again test 5.5 percent above its parity level next week.
""I don't expect much of a move higher this week, but next week the crown could again test +5.5 percent,"" said Martin Strauch, a dealer at Citibank.
Jakub Perina of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka added: ""A lot depends on London traders because they are very interested right now.""
The Czech crown is fixed daily at up to plus or minus 7.5 percent of the mid-point of a basket comprising 35 percent dollars and 65 percent marks.
On Wednesday, the Czech National Bank (CNB) fixed the crown at 27.712 to the dollar and 16.846 to the mark, putting the currency 5.05 percent above the mid-point.
""If the crown does not exceed its fluctuation band, the central bank will not intervene,"" CNB Spokesman Martin Svehla told the econoimc daily Hospodarske Noviny on Wednesday.
Last February the CNB widened the corridor within which it fixes the crown each day to plus or minus 7.5 percent of parity, from plus/minus 0.5 percent.
Since then the foreign exchange market, and not the central bank, has been much more of a force in determining the crown's rate within this controlled float.
Several dealers, however, confirmed to Reuters that the CNB had contacted them on Tuesday when the crown hit 5.3 percent above parity, and said they took the move as a signal that intervention was possible whn the currency hit plus 6.0 percent.
""The market was a little spooked by this move, and the crown fell immediately,"" said one London-based analyst. ""But it regained its strength today, and I think many people now expect some intervention if it moves much higher.""
CSOB's Strauch said: ""They (the CNB) could be ready to intervene at some point, possibly +6.0 percent, but it depends on whether it appears to have strength to move even higher at that point.""
The main underlying reason for foreign interest in the Czech crown is the large interest rate differential between the Czech Republic and western countries.
In the middle of 1996 the CNB raised the discount rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent and increased minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months hover around 12.5 percent.
Though interbank market rates eased some 60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage points, in January, the central bank and government officials have both expressed reluctance to officially lower rates because of strong demand for money and investments.
Analysts said rates are still high enough, howeer, to continue attracting large inflows of capital.

AlanCrosby,"The Prague Stock Exchange, boosted by strong blue chip gains, hit a year-high on Thursday, but analysts said any strong bullish sentiment was tempered by a lack of liquidity and low foreign investor interest.
At the heart of the bourse's rise has been a resurgence of the market's two most-capitalised issues -- SPT Telecom and CEZ -- which account for over one-third of the PX50 index.
Both hits 52-week highs to push the index 1.93 percent higher to 591.3, but analysts cautioned that the market was still plagued by a lack of liquidity, which was distorting price movements.
""Volumes are very thin, when you come to the market looking for a bigger parcel of shares it doesn't take much interest to move the prices. But the truth is, not a lot of foreign money is flowing in,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.
SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, jumped 169 crowns to 3,744, while CEZ, which accounts for 14 percent, rose 51 crowns to 1,210.
Dealers said they did not see any fundamental reasons for SPT shares to rise much further, but that CEZ could climb slightly higher since it lagged other blue chips during last year's mid-summer rally.
The PSE has recently showed signs of life after a fourth quarter 1996 slump took 25 percent off the index after a lack of commitment on the part of government officials to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency undermined the market.
The index has gained 9.6 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and bourse officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors.
Though it may not be a panacea to the market woes, most analysts agree that the oversight commission could be the most important step the PSE could take in 1997.
""Foreign investors have definitely been heartened by official movement on cleaning up the market,"" said one foreign broker.
""The market will probably edge up slightly with such low liquidity. Hopefully when 1996 earnings begin to come in the bourse will have a new impetus,"" he added. Company results are expected to begin flowing in at the beginning of March.

AlanCrosby,"The Czech Republic took both reverse singles matches from India on Sunday clinching a berth in the second round of the Davis Cup, but lost its number one player, Petr Korda in the process.
Jiri Novak gave the Czechs a 3-2 victory with a straight set 6-1 6-4 6-3 victory over Mahesh Bhupathi after Korda, who announced he was retiring from Davis Cup play, had brought his team level with a 5-7 6-3 6-4 6-1 win over Leander Paes.
Novak barely broke a sweat against Bhupathi, who is ranked more than 400 places lower, needing just 90 minutes to dispatch the Indian number two.
Jumping out to a quick start, Novak, ranked 67th in the world, took the first set 6-1 and went up 5-0 in the second before losing his rythmn, and four consecutive games. But he regrouped to hold serve in the tenth game for the set.
He then broke Bhupathi twice in the third set to clinch the tie. ""This is one of the biggest matches I have won in my life,"" said an elated Novak following the match.
Korda, ranked 33rd in the world, also had little trouble in his matchup with Paes, overpowering the Indian at the net and unleashing powerful groundstrokes from the baseline.
He squandered five break points in the first set, while Paes, ranked 105th in the world, took advantage of the only one he had to take the first set in 53 minutes.
But Korda showed no signs of a cold that has plagued him throughout the week, quickly getting back on track to take the next three sets.
""Overall though, I am still really happy both myself and the team performed,"" said Olympic bronze medalist Paes.
After the win, Korda said he would no longer play for the Czechs in the Davis Cup, complaining of the demands it put on a player.
""There was a lot of pressure on me for this match, but I showed the kind of player I am,"" he said.
""I have thought about retiring (from Davis Cup) for a while and it's time to leave. It is a very tiring, draining experience and I think you should leave at the top. Now is the right time.""
Korda, who was once ranked as high as fifth in the world, has been the anchor of the Czech team since his debut in 1988, compiling a 30-12 overall record, including three wins against India this weekend.
The loss of Korda is the second setback for last year's semifinalists, after Czech number two Daniel Vacek bowed out of action to concentrate more on his performance on the ATP tour.

After a strong rise last week, market heavyweights SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka, which combined account for over one-half of the PX50 index, all fell sharply to drag the index down 0.28 percent to 598.0.

SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, closed down 75 crowns at 3,700, while CEZ, which accounts for 14 percent, was off 28 crowns to 1,202 and Komercni, with market cap of 11 percent, lost 25 crowns to 2,620.

But, he added: ""Foreign investors are definitely interested and kicking starting the market...and we expect that to continue on but things have overheated a little at the moment.""

In late afternoon trading on Monday it was holding steady at 5.32 percent above its basket mid-point, up slightly from the central bank's daily fixing at +5.28 percent. The crown was fixed on Friday at 5.23 percent.

AlanCrosby,"Czech consumer inflation continued its gradual downtrend in January, but analysts said they do not expect a loosening of the central bank's tight monetary policy in the short-term.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said January inflation, month-on-month, was 1.2 percent, putting the year-on-year rate at 7.4 percent, down from 8.6 percent the previous month.
The key sliding average inflation figure, which uses 1993 as a base, edged down to 8.7 percent from 8.8 percent in December, and was down from 9.1 percent in January 1996.
""The January number is very good, about one percentage point lower than a year ago,"" Kamil Janacek, cheif economist at Komercni Banka told Reuters.
""If prices and some deregulations develop accoridng to plan in the next months, and thanks to producer prices being under five percent...there is a high probability that 1997 inflation could end at around, or just under, eight percent,"" he added.
The CSU said in a report that the biggest influences on the January inflation rate were food, drinks and tobacco products which rose 1.3 percent in the month, transportation which rose 3.6 percent and housing which rose by 1.3 percent.
It added that of the 1.2 percent month-on-month rate, seasonal influences accounted for 0.23 percent, putting the seasonally-adjusted monthly rate at 0.97 percent.
CSU figures show price deregulation influenced the seasonally-adjusted rate by 0.63 percent, while seasonally-adjusted core inflation was 0.34 percent.
Despite the downtrend, most analysts agreed that there seems little chance the Czech National Bank (CNB), the central bank, will ease its tight monetary policy in the near future despite the sustained downtrend in CPI.
Curbing inflation has been at the heart of almost all of the CNB's policies, and both CNB and government officials have said they expect rates to remain high, at least over the near term.
""The month-on-month rate appears favourable,"" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings, said.
""While there may be some room for it, I doubt the central bank will lower rates immediately -- maybe in the second quarter at the earliest,"" he added.
Last summer the CNB raised its key discount rate one percentage point to 10.5 percent, and hiked minimum reserve requirements to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent of deposits to squeeze off surging domestic demand.
The moves have appeared to signficantly slow growth in the money supply, which is now at the lower end of the central bank's 13 to 17 percent growth target.
But central bank officials have warned that wage growth -- which was up 21.2 percent in nominal terms in December according to preliminary figures -- and its influence on inflation is a growing concern.
""The government has to somehow limit wage growth. It's just too high and this must be addressed before the central bank will move rates,"" said one London-based economist.
Foreign exchange traders said the crown was unaffected by January's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts.
The crown was fixed by the central bank on Monday at 5.28 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +5.14 percent fixing from last Friday.

AlanCrosby,"The Prague Stock Exchange slipped on Monday from last week's year high on a round of profit taking, but analysts said sentiment remains bullish for the coming weeks.
After a strong rise last week, market heavyweights SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka, which together account for almost half of the PX50 index, all fell to drag the index down 0.77 percent to 595.1 points.
""The market has corrected a little bit, but there seems to be good support at this level,"" Marco Anderegg of Patria Finance told Reuters.
""Foreign investor interest remains solid and towards the end of last week broader issues were gaining interest so it looks solid for a lot of the market,"" he added.
SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, closed down 75 crowns at 3,700, while power company CEZ, which accounts for 14 percent, was off 28 crowns to 1,202 and commercial bank Komercni (11 percent) lost 25 crowns to 2,620.
""We saw some of the blue chips such as Komercni and SPT rebound in late deals, which could show that the market's weakness will be short-lived. I expect to see prices begin rising again soon,"" said one local trader.
The PSE has been climbing steadily since a slump in the fourth quarter 1996 took 25 percent off the index. Analysts blamed a lack of government commitment to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency for the dive.
The index has gained nearly 10 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors.
Bram Buring of Brno Broker Group said the correction could last for several weeks as lower than expected company results began to flood in, possibly taking as much as five percent from the index before it rebounds.
But he added: ""Foreign investors are definitely interested and kick starting the market...We expect that to continue but things have overheated a little at the moment.""
Analysts added that the recent strong performance of the crown should also boost the equities market since investors are shielded from wide currency fluctuations.
The crown has gained over three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks.
In late afternoon trading on Monday it was holding steady at 5.32 percent above its basket mid-point, up slightly from the central bank's daily fixing at 5.28 percent over the mid-point. The crown was fixed on Friday at 5.23 percent above the mid-point.

AlanCrosby,"A wave of high-yielding Czech crown Eurobonds that has flooded the debt market since the beginning of the year has begun to ebb, as interest rates ease and arbitrage opportunities decline, analysts said on Tuesday.
""The Euro-madness is definitely over. We may see a couple more issues but those will be mainly by issuers who are active in the Czech Republic,"" Ota Otepka, chief bond trader at ING Barings, told Reuters.
Since the start of the year, issuers have rushed to take advantage of a stable, strong currency and interest rates above 11 percent, flooding the market with nearly 30 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) worth of Eurobonds in just over four weeks.
Dealers said that with interest rates so high, and a crown that is 65 percent linked to the mark but yielding seven to eight percentage points above it, the appetite for crown Eurobonds had appeared insatiable.
But interest rates have eased some 60-70 basis points since the start of the year and yields have dropped, spoiling the appetite for many investors.
""Maybe lead managers were overly optimistic about the potential placing capabilities and appetite of foreign investors,"" said Jan Pudil of WoodCommerz.
""Of course this hunger has been filled quite substantially. At this stage we are at the level where these investors are now satisfied,"" he added.
More than 20 bond issues were launched in crowns by a host of top-rated, retail-friendly names, lured by its reputation as one of Europe's most stable currencies.
German media group Bertelsmann AG launched on Tuesday a one billion crown one-year bond with a 10.5 percent coupon, but the rate of issuance has slowed.
Analysts estimate about 90 percent of the crown bonds were bought by retail investors from Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland.
Investors saw a great chance of picking up high-yield, low-risk paper but issuers and managers were presented with an easy arbitrage opportunity since rates were so high.
But Pudil said that issuers, once awash in opportunities for currency swaps, were now hard pressed to find advantageous rates allowing many to place bonds with coupons above 10 percent, a psychological minimum level.
""You have a three-year swap now at 10.25 percent and if you were to bring a cross-currency swapped three-year Eurobond, you get a coupon below 10 percent and you can't sell something to west European retail investors at below 10 percent,"" he said.
Another trader added: ""A lot of the issues were swap driven, but swap prices have fallen below the Eurobond yields and this has stopped the arbitrage possibility.""
""We also may see declining interest in buying Czech Eurobonds because the crown is so strong that its security is declining,"" he added.
The crown was fixed at a record high against its dollar/mark basket on Tuesday at 5.51 percent above the parity midpoint, some three percentage points higher than at the beginning of the year.
Traders added that two and three-year bonds are almost impossible to launch now, given the lack of arbitrage options. Most issuers had preferred short-dated bonds anyway due to an inverted yield curve which meant higher coupons are available at shorter maturities.

AlanCrosby,"The Czech crown fell sharply on Thursday following central bank comments that it was not satisfied with the currency's recent rise, but dealers said the crown remains attractive and should stabilise by week's end.
One of post-Communist Europe's most stable currencies, the crown has consistently reached record highs in recent weeks, fuelled by demand brought about from a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year.
But while the crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket trading at 3.48 percent above parity, it was down over 60 basis points from its opening and some 200 points lower from Tuesday's record fixing at +5.51.
Analysts said, however, that the country's high interest rate differential and the country's overall economic stability should limit any further drop.
""For this week, we may see the crown slightly weaker, but the crown is still very attractive and I do not see space for much furthening weaking of it,"" said Jiri Becvar of BNP-Dresdner in Prague.
The central bank's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June.
The fall comes on the heels of Wednesday's comment by the central bank it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary.
""Intervention (on the market) is our normal instrument, and we can use it whenever we are not satisfied (with the crown's exchange rate),"" CNB spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters.
""The other question is whether we are satisfied? You heard (CNB) governor (Josef Tosovsky) saying there is 'no reason' for the crown to be like this. It signals that the central bank is not fully satisfied with this development,"" he added.
He declined to elaborate, and said these were just ""general"" comments.
Breta Tichanek of ING Barings said he expected the crown to trade within the range plus four to plus five percent from the basket midpoint throughout the day.
""I think it's partially because of yesterday's comment (by the CNB) and the closing of some postions and speculative flows,"" he said.
The depth of the fall also took the market by surprise initially, with many dealers saying they had been prepared for an early attack on +4.25 percent, but expected London dealers to take profits and then stabilise.
""In fact there were new buyers after some brief consolidation and the index dropped to +3.45,"" said Petr Korous of CSOB.
""There are a lot of long positions and they have to be covered so the market may squeeze them. If there is nothing special I am very sceptical that we can see the crown index weaken much more than to around +3.00,"" he added.
Some crown dealers have said the central bank had been putting out feelers in the market recently, though most did not expect to see any intervention, especially after the weakening on Thursday.
The CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.
"
AlanCrosby,"The Czech crown, battered down by central bank comments in recent days, rebounded on Friday bolstered by a wave of foreign currency selling though dealers cautioned the market remains very nervous.
In late afternoon trading, the crown was at 4.70 percent above its mark/dollar basket parity, up more than 50 basis points from the open but still some 80 basis points from Tuesday's record fixing at +5.51.
""Some bigger foreign players pushed the crown up, selling hard currency for crowns,"" said Jiri Ubry of ING Bank.
Added Martin Strauch of Citibank: ""There were some break-even sellers in the market and the crown has now rebounded to near its peak before the central bank's comments.""
One of post-Communist Europe's most stable currencies, the crown has consistently reached record highs in recent weeks, fuelled by demand brought about from a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year.
But the market made an about face on Wednesday after the central bank said it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary.
The crown fell over 200 basis points against parity as many London traders bailed out over the next two days.
Petr Korous of bank CSOB said some profit taking was also pushing the crown higher, and that there still appeared to be a large number of traders with long positions of hard currency against Czech crowns that may now sell off.
""When there were these comments from the central bank, a couple of big players may have bought hard currency because they had never held a long position before and got nervous,"" Korous said.
""It looks like now they are slightly losing patience and getting rid of their positions at slightly higher than what we saw just three days ago,"" he added.
Dealers said they have seen few indications that the central bank was again on the verge of intervening, adding that they did not expect any action since the crown was not likely to rise above the five percent parity level.
The CNB has not intervened directly on the market since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.
Few dealers predicted the crown would rise much further since the market was so nervous, but noted the crown appeared to have good support at around 4.5 percent above parity.
""It's tough to predict the crown's direction right now becuase it's so volatile in relation to any comments about it,"" said Citibank's Strauch.
Korous also noted that the current stalemate in parliament where the ultra-right Republican and Communist opposition deputies have used stalling tactics to drag out debate for four days over a sensitive post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany could create more instability.
""I feel that we won't go to the levels we saw recently because there is some nervousness over the political scene here,especially when the ruling politicians have no idea how to eliminate the obstructions they are causing,"" he said.
"
AlanCrosby,"Czech industrial output growth slowed in 1996, but analysts said they were more concerned with a sharp rise in wages that is dulling the country's competitive edge and exacerbating the impact of a widening trade deficit.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Monday that industrial output, in real terms, rose 1.5 percent in December, putting output 6.8 percent higher for the whole of 1996, down from 9.2 percent for the previous year.
It also said nominal industrial wages grew 17.4 percent last year, after 17 percent growth in 1995.
While analysts said they were not surprised by the output figures due to a continued slowdown in the economies of the Czechs' biggest trading partners, they said wages were growing far too fast.
""I think the slowdown in output is not a big surprise given the problems with economies abroad and the stronger than expected crown,"" said Vladimir Kreidl, an economist at Patria Finance, who said he expects output to remain steady in 1997.
""The wage growth and trade deficits are by far the two most troublesome developments in the economy. Nominal wages should not be growing by more than 12 or 13 percent, which would be in line with productivity,"" he added.
The crown has strengthened by some three percentage points against its currency basket since the beginning of the year, pushed higher mainly by demand from some 30 billion crowns worth of crown-denominated Eurobond issues.
The strength of the crown has also negatively effected the trade deficit, stifling exports as the gap grew to a record of more than 160 billion crowns for 1996.
""The Czech Republic is a strong country but it's got to deal with some of the sypmtoms of success such as these very large capital inflows that have driven the currency too high,"" said Jonathan Garner, director of research at Robert Fleming.
Added Patria's Kreidl: ""Wage growth could effect inflation but foreign competition is so strong that we haven't seen that impact yet, and probably won't. But at the same time, Czech companies are losing competitiveness.""
The Czech crown is fixed daily at up to plus or minus 7.5 percent of the mid-point of a basket comprising 35 percent dollars and 65 percent marks.
On Monday, the central bank fixed the crown at 28.357 to the dollar and 16.737 to the mark putting the currency 4.65 percent above the mid-point.
Many investors have flocked to the crown given the Czech Republic's stable political and economic climate, and its high interest rates.
Most analysts agree, however, that the central bank can ill afford to cut rates at the present, given the necessity to keep inflation and the money supply in check.
""There has to be some break in the development of nominal wages in industry. It will be difficult to do. Monetary policy must remain tight...there is no place for lower rates,"" said one analyst.
In the middle of 1996 the CNB raised the discount rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent and increased minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months in the Republic hover around 12.5 percent.
Though rates eased some 60 basis points in January, the central bank ond government officials have both expressed reluctance officially to lower rates because of strong demand for money and investments.

AlanCrosby,"The Czech central bank, for the second time in a week, said on Tuesday that it was prepared to intervene to stop the crown from strengthening further, pushing the crown lower and prompting a sell-off by London traders.
""Our starting point is that parity is a base, and this is the right level (for the crown),"" Jiri Pospisil, the head of the Czech National Bank's (CNB) monetary department, told an economic conference.
After the comment, the crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket midpoint at 28.750/dollar 16.873/mark, or 3.68 percent over parity with the basket, but down nearly 100 basis points from the CNB's daily fixing at +4.65 percent.
""There is a debate going on at the central bank over the nature of the appreciation of the exchange rate, and on the most suitable way to react to it,"" Pospisil, who is also on the CNB board, said.
""The debate has not been finished but our possibilities are clear: either we can react through interest rates or through direct intervention on the market,"" he added.
One of post-Communist Europe's most stable currencies, the crown consistently reached record highs in late January and early February, fuelled by demand brought about by a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year.
The crown's surge has also been boosted by investors taking advantage of interest rate spreads against major currencies and an inverted yield curve.
Dealers said Pospisil's comments had shaken the market, especially some foreign investors, and could force the crown down further before it finds support.
""This has really shaken the market badly,"" said one London analyst. ""I think a sell-off could push it down to as low as three percent above parity before finding some support.""
It was the second time in the past week that central bank comments have pushed the crown sharply lower.
Last Wednesday the central bank said it had the option of intervening on the market when necessary, prompting London dealers to bail out over the next two days and pushing the crown down some 200 basis points against parity.
Despite Pospisil's words, dealers said that it did not appear that any intervention was imminent as it could not lower rates due to concerns over controlling the money supply and inflation.
""I think the central bank is trying to make the crown more volatile by its comments, but I'm not sure if it is ready to do anything real such as intervene,"" said Breta Tichanek of ING Bank. ""They are just trying to push the crown back to parity by letting the market do it in its own way,"" he added.
The CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.
The CNB's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June. Meanwhile, inflation in January slowed to 7.4 percent, year-on-year, from 8.6 percent in December.

AlanCrosby,"The Czech Republic's trade deficit nearly doubled in January, year-on-year, as exports stagnated, and analysts said they saw little change in the trend of the burgeoning trade shortfall.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said the January trade deficit hit 13.6 billion crowns compared with a 7.86 billion crown deficit in January 1996.
The CSU added that imports, led by continued strong inflows of machinery and raw materials, grew by 8.2 percent year-on-year, while exports contracted by 2.5 percent, spurred by a sharp 11.8 percent decrease in raw material exports.
""The figures are better than expected...the market expected above 15 billion crowns...but I don't think it will mean any change in the trade (balance's) development,"" said Petr Tomek of Zivnostenska Banka.
The bureau did not issue a revised end-year 1996 figure for the trade balance, which hit a record 160.3 billion crowns. It has forecast the 1997 trade deficit to rise to about 215 billion crowns.
The CSU said overall nominal imports for January firmed to 60.04 billion crowns from 55.5 billion for the same month last year, while exports totalled 46.45 billion, down from a previous 47.63 billion.
Boris Gomez of ING Barings said that while January's trade figures were an improvement from December, where the monthly figure was 17.996 billion crowns, the beginning of the year is traditionally a period of slowing trade.
""We're not overly encouraged since historically the first two months of the year we usually see relatively lower deficits because of generally weaker trade flows,"" he said.
""We are hoping for a stabilisation of the deficit. If what happened last year when the deficit picked up pace in the second quarter, it's not good, though we are banking on import growth slowing a bit given the tight monetary environment.""
Last summer the central bank tightened its monetary policy, raising its discount rate one full percentage point to 10.5 percent, and minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months in the Republic hover around 12.5 percent.
Analysts added that the trade figures were also influenced by the strengthening of the currency, the crown, which gained some three percentage points against its dollar/mark basket in January, boosted by demand brought about by a wave of over 35 billion crowns worth crown-denominated Eurobonds.
""If the Bundesbank sees it policy down the road of keeping the mark relatively weak to help the economy, that's not good news for the Czechs, nor are the rumblings that the economic recovery of the EU may be slower than expected,"" Gomez said.
CSU figures showed EU countries accounted for more than 60 percent of both imports and exports with the Czech Republic.

AlanCrosby,"Czech trading firms saw the trade deficit nearly doubling, year-on-year, in the first quarter of 1997, while analysts said the figures were in line with forecasts and the crown firmed on the news.
A survey of importers and exporters by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU), released on Wednesday, showed the trade deficit should rise to about 45 billion crowns ($1.6 billion) for the quarter, up from a 27.1 billion crown gap for the first quarter 1996.
Analysts said the survey figures were realistic given the January shortfall of 13.6 billion crowns, adding the first quarter was usually a slow period for trade and the deficit should grow substantially after the quarter.
""It's more or less in line with our forecasts, but I think the deficit situation will gradually worsen throughout the year,"" Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance told Reuters.
The CSU itself has issued a forecast for the overall 1997 trade deficit to rise to between 211-219 billion crowns after last year's record shortfall of 160.3 billion crowns, but it has not issued its own quarterly estimate.
The CSU said in a statement the survey included estimates from firms which accounted for 20 percent of all import business last year, and 36 percent of exports.
It said 170 firms were polled in the survey, of which 67 percent responded.
""The real question lies in how much the deficit will accelerate after the first quarter,"" said one London-based analyst. ""Last year we saw a sharp increase in the pace of growth in the deficit and if that occurs again, it could be a problem.""
The survey showed total imports were expected to rise in the first quarter by some 10 percent, year-on-year, with raw materials, foodstuffs and machinery imports accounting for most of the growth. Total imports in the first quarter of 1996 were 174.3 billion crowns.
Import prices were expected to edge about two percent higher overall, though prices of chemicals and related products, beverages and tobacco should ease slightly.
It said total exports for the quarter should remain static at last year's 147.2 billion crown level. Export prices should rise by about 2.5 percent, year-on-year.
Ironically, the forecast reassured the foreign exchange (forex) market, after the crown lost ground on reports that several German banks were expecting a weakening of the currency and were not recommending clients to buy Czech state debt.
Forex dealers said the crown fell by as much as 50 basis points against its dollar/mark basket midpoint because of the reports, but recovered some 30 basis points to 3.55 percent above the midpoint, or 28.430 to the dollar and 17.017 to the mark after the forecast.
""I think 45 billion crowns is the amount that probably all economists were expecting...The crown began to rebound right after the forecast was released,"" said Jiri Ubry of ING Bank. ($ = 28.46 Czech Crowns)

AlanCrosby,"The Prague Stock Exchange's 1997 bull run ground to a halt on Thursday as investors took profits, and analysts predicted prices would continue falling in the short-term.
The PX50 index, which has shot up over 16 percent  this year to a two-year high on Tuesday of 629.0, retreated 14.0 points, or 2.23 percent, to close at 613.6 on Thursday.
Leading the bourse lower were its three biggest issues -- SPT Telecom a.s., power utility CEZ a.s. and Komercni Banka a.s. -- each of which fell more than 2.2 percent at the fix.
The profit-taking came as little surprise.

AlanCrosby,"Profit-taking and changing market sentiment pulled the Czech crown lower on Thursday, and dealers said they expected a further weakening of the currency since there were few fundamentals to support it.
Once one of Europe's most stable currencies, confidence in the crown has been shaken badly in the past two weeks as the market became nervous following central bank comments that it was overvalued and that interest rate cuts may be in the air.
In late afternoon trading, the crown was at 28.873 against the dollar and 17.090 to the mark, implying +2.74 against basket midpoint after opening at +3.53 percent.
Dealers said it had been pushed lower as thoughts turned to actions and investors ran to take profits while they could.
""The fall is part profit-taking, and part change in market sentiment,"" said Breta Tichanek of ING Bank in Prague.
""We are really seeing an outflow of investment from the crown at this moment, but I don't think it will last for more than a couple of weeks,"" he added.
At midday the central bank followed the early trend with its daily fixing, putting the crown/dollar at 28.784, and the crown/mark at 17.040, or +3.03 against the basket.
The pullout follows recent media reports that German banks see the crown moving lower and are advising clients to stay away from Czech bonds.
The crown had strengthened since the beginning of the year by about three percent against the basket as demand from a wave of over 35 billion crowns worth of crown-denominated Eurobonds.
""The market has been very nervous and I think the German media reports were the last straw for some investors. They have decided to take their profits now and run,"" said a London-based trader.
At the crown's peak earlier this month -- before talk of possible central bank intervention on the market -- it rose to +5.5 percent over parity.
Many investors had boosted the crown as they looked to take advantage of a high interest rate differential with western Europe but the central bank comments, coupled with an easing of interbank market rates have taken away much of the crown's lustre.
""I think the market is on a calm wave...we expect further tests for the Czech crown weakening. We see also movement on the money market and money market derivatives,"" said Petr Korous of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.
Prague Interbank Offered Rates (PRIBOR) on Thursday traded in a range of 11.5-12.5 percent, down about 60-70 basis points from the beginning of the year.
ING's Tichanek said there was little chance the currency would come close to returning to its highs earlier this month, adding the crown was having trouble finding strong support at current levels.
Further damaging confidence in the crown is the country's burgeoning trade deficit.
The Czech Statistical Bureau has forecast a 1997 shortfall of between 211-219 billion crowns after last year's record deficit of 160.3 billion crowns and analysts say that later in the year the crown will find itself under increasing depreciation pressure because of this.

AlanCrosby,"The Prague Stock Exchange's 1997 bull run, as expected, ground to a halt on Thursday as investors took profits, and analysts predicted little change in the bourse's fortunes over the short-term.
The PX50 index, which has shot up over 16 percent since trading began this year to a two-year high on Tuesday of 629.0, retreated 9.0 points, or 1.43 percent, at the bourse's daily price fixing to 618.6.
Leading the bourse lower were losses to its three biggest issues -- SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka -- each of which fell more than 2.2 percent at the fix.
""It's a very thin market and when you see a little profit-taking like we are, the market kind of collapses,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. ""I am afraid that the trend will probably continue.""

AlexanderSmith,"A proposed reform of Britain's state pensions system would revolutionise the financial services industry, market participants said on Thursday.
The ruling Conservative government on Wednesday unveiled proposals which aim to prevent huge burdens falling on future taxpayers by making workers take responsibility for providing for their old age.
Roger Taylor, deputy chairman of composite insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, described the plans as ""the biggest shift in financial services in the last 50 years"".
Taylor said it would encourage other governments to follow suit, adding that if the proposals were enacted they would start to generate additional business in three to four years time.
""For the industry as a whole it is good news,"" Tony Baker, deputy director general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), told Reuters.
Prime Minister John Major must call an election by May and the opposition Labour Party is well ahead in the opinion polls.
Labour wants to retain the basic state pension and develop a new range of second pensions for those not already in occupational pension schemes.
But the banking and life insurance industry is gearing up for change whatever the outcome of the election, arguing that demographic changes mean additional pension provisions are essential for economic and social stability beyond 2000.
Banking analyst John Leonard of U.S. investment bank Salomon Brothers agreed that the British government's decision to address the problem was an opportunity for the industry.
""Anything giving rise to privately managed assets must introduce interesting products for banks and the insurance sector,"" he said.
He said a large additional pool of privately managed money to fund the pensions was a particularly big opportunity for the ""large volume, efficiently managed providers with good distribution networks.""
But the shift from state to privately held pensions could also spawn a major marketing war between the firms most likely to win business.
This in itself would be costly, at least at the outset. The start of any such scheme would be particularly important as once individuals had chosen a provider with which to invest their pension contributions, it would be difficult for other companies to persuade them to move.
Baker said there would still be plenty of business for existing players in the market which were not able to sell the new scheme, labelled Basic Pension Plus.
He said there would have to be regulations governing matters such as maximum charges, transferability, reporting and investment returns, while not all insurance companies would necessarily be included on the approved list of providers.
While the desirability of involvement for companies would depend on the rules set out by the government, Baker said the scheme could lead to further consolidation in the industry, where only the big, efficient providers could meet the criteria.
He said the scheme could hit smaller players and other elements of the industry, particularly independent financial advisors (IFAs), who could lose out if individuals chose to top up basic contributions with their main pensions provider rather than other companies.
""The need for a middle man might be much less than at the present time,"" he said.
Baker added that the government had underlined that it wanted simplicity and lower costs to result from the changes, factors which he said would mean individuals ""buying"" their pensions rather than being sold them.
The importance of the move was underlined by Royal &amp; Sun Alliance's Taylor, who said self-provision would become the biggest single transaction an individual would make.
Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Britain's Halifax Building Society, said earlier this week that the group would target long-term savings products -- life assurance, pensions and investments -- because of their growth potential.
""With an ageing population and governments unable to look after people as they have historically been able to do in retirement, the requirement on the private individual to provide for the long-term future will be accentuated,"" Blackburn said.

AlexanderSmith,"British estate agency and financial products group Hambro Countrywide Plc has capitalised on the housing market recovery and is prepared for further growth.
The company said on Thursday it had turned around a pre-tax loss of 3.9 million pounds for 1995 into a pre-tax profit of 30.8 million pounds for 1996 and promised there was more to come.
""I think we are only half way there yet...if we get to anything like the volumes that we anticipate this year...the prospects are obviously very exciting,"" managing director Harry Hill told Reuters. Hill said the British housing market was improving across the country, although there were still regional differences. He said London and the south east were outpacing other areas, but added he did not believe prices would rise unsustainably.
""I suspect it will find a level,"" he said. ""There's an enormous momentum that will probably sustain the market this year and next before it even starts to draw breath,"" he added.
All the factors were in place for a long, sustained recovery in Britain and within that context house prices would increase.
Hambro Countrywide, which is 52 percent owned by British merchant bank Hambros Plc, also announced that it had broken with tradition and made a move into the burgeoning London market by buying an estate agency and letting business for 7.45 million pounds.
Faron Sutaria &amp; Co has five existing branches in London and plans to expand in the west, south and north west of the capital. ""From the middle of this year we will have nine offices under Faron's banner and we would hope in the next two years to have another seven,"" Hill said. Hambro Countrywide said the entire management team at Faron wanted to stay with the business, adding that the acquisition offered the opportunity to generate additional revenue by offering mortgages and financial services to new clients. Hill does not see the impending British election slowing Hambro Countrywide's business and said a victory for the opposition Labour party could in fact benefit the firm's clients. ""I don't think it will make much difference either way,"" he said.
He said Hambro Countrywide had sold more mortgages and retail financial services during February than in any other month in its history.
And there was no sign of change to the direct correlation between people buying houses and financial products from the group. ""Most people want to do most things if they can, easily and comfortably under one roof,"" Hill said.
While there are a growing number of competitors in the market-place, Hill said he did not see Hambro Countrywide's margins being pinched as a result.
Asked if Hambro Countrywide planned to make any further acquisitions, Hill said ""We aren't talking to anyone today"". But the group said it was in discussions with a ""number of leading law firms"" as part of a move to set up a conveyancing operation.
""We believe this will bring significant benefits to all our clients in smoothing and speeding up the home buying process,"" the group said, adding it expected to open its first centre in April 1997.
As for Hambro Countrywide's own future, chairman Christopher Sporborg said there was little chance of a change in the current shareholding by Hambros.
Shares in Hambro Countrywide, which also announced a final dividend of 1.5 pence to make a total dividend of 2.0 pence, were down 4.0 pence at 1100 GMT at 123.5 pence.

AlexanderSmith,"A British firm believes it has developed a computer programme which could prevent other financial firms getting into the sort of situation Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) is currently trying to resolve.
Numerous risk management systems already exist, but Frasin Limited says its Windows-based SOFWIN is the first to address operational risk management rather than financial risk.
""We believe it will prompt senior management to ask the right questions, which will create a more disciplined and controlled environment,"" Frasin's chief executive Philip Martin told Reuters on Tuesday.
MGAM is attempting to unscramble a complicated web of investments in three of its funds. These led to the funds being temporarily suspended last week after it revealed ""suspected irregularities"" in the them.
A fund manager for two of the funds was suspended at the same time and had his assets frozen by a High Court injunction.
Ironically, Martin says he took the product to show Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank, some months ago with a view to selling it to them.
He says he will still offer it to the firm, freely admitting that his prospects may have been boosted by publicity surrounding MGAM and a recent fine for fund management firms in the Robert Fleming group over so-called ""rat-trading"" by a fund manager in a Hong Kong joint venture with Jardine Matheson.
""I have to thank Morgan Grenfell and Jardine Fleming because their timing has been impeccable,"" he says with a grin.
Martin believes the software could also help banks avoid another Barings situation, where so-called ""rogue trader"" Nick Leeson, was able to run both the front and back offices, effectively monitoring his own trading.
Leeson is currently serving a long jail sentence in Singapore for fraudulent trading which led to losses of around $1.4 billion and culminated in the blue-blooded bank's collapse.
While Martin admits it will never be possible to eradicate rogue individuals, he says closer monitoring by senior management of all an institution's operations is essential.
If a chief executive, chief financial officer or other top official wants to avoid criticism in the event of a problem within the firm, then a programme such as that offered by Frasin, which is part of the HSBC group, should ensure they have adopted every measure possible to avoid such events.
SOFWIN, which costs 12,000 pounds ($18,640) a year and must be signed up to for three years, takes the institution through a detailed questionnaire, with a possible 3,600 different questions.
The collated results, after any subsidiaries or branches have also been through the process, then gives a clear picture of where any potential weaknesses lie, Martin said. It can also compare the standards of different branches and how they each match up with an ""ideal"" set-up.
Much of the programme is devoted to dealing activities, as this has been found to be a major area of concern.
""The largest part revolves around dealing activities. I have spoken to senior managers who are scared to death about what their traders are up to,"" he added.
But however thorough the programme, Martin says the buck stops with senior management and they are the main target of his marketing.
""It takes commitment by senior management. If they are not committed to it (assessing the company's organisational risk), then it's a waste of time. But they are opening themselves up to criticism,"" he said. ($1=.6436 Pound)

AlexanderSmith,"Kyriacos Papouis, the trader allegedly linked to NatWest Markets' 50 million pound ($80 million) options loss, has resigned from U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns.
""We have accepted the resignation of Kyriacos Papouis, an interest rate trader in our derivatives department,"" a Bear Stearns spokeswoman told Reuters.
""We have conducted a thorough review of his open trading positions and are satisfied that they are all booked and valued properly. We have notified the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) of his resignation,"" she added.
The spokeswoman declined to give any further details of Papouis' resignation.
Earlier this week, Bear Stearns said Papouis was ""on leave, pending further information"".
Papouis could not be contacted for comment on Friday.
Papouis left NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank, late last year and moved to Bear Stearns.
Last week NatWest disclosed mispricing errors in its interest rate options book and said it had suspended a senior trader, named by banking sources as Neil Dodgson, for alleged ""failure to supervise"". It also reported a former options trader, allegedly Papouis, to financial markets watchdog the SFA.
Options are contracts which give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price on a set date in the future.
The SFA said it had been notified of the NatWest probe into the loss and had opened a file while the Bank of England has said it is cooperating with the SFA.
The episode was especially embarrassing to NatWest coming only days after it announced its 1996 results.
On Thursday, a senior NatWest Markets official said that compared with the size of losses run up from derivatives trading at some other banks, it had got off relatively lightly.
""If that is all it costs us to learn the value of a tight infrastructure, then it could turn out to be a blessing in disguise,"" Nick Riley was reported by Britain's Press Association agency as saying.
Riley is administrative officer for NatWest Markets' global foreign exchange business. His comments were made during a conversation at a charitable function on Thursday night, banking sources said.
The PA said Riley had pointed out that other banks such as Barings, which crashed in 1995 owing around $1.4 billion as a result of losses run up by Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson, paid far more to find out that their internal controls were inadequate.
But a NatWest spokeswoman distanced the firm from Riley's comments.
""He is not a spokesman for NatWest and his comments are not therefore attributable to the company. This was a personal view,"" she told Reuters.
"
AlexanderSmith,"A group of U.S. and European firms on Tuesday revealed they had developed a system for money transactions over the Internet.
The team, which includes AT &amp; T Corp Unisource, Apple Computer Inc, Nokia Oy and Mondex UK, will run the project on a pilot basis.
""We have developed protocols for shopping and banking that allow users to pay for electronic services via the Internet,"" Julian Wilson, Unisource's director of service development told a briefing.
Wilson said he believed the system, involving the transfer of electronic cash from one device to another, was ""a world first"".
The developers of the system said it was the world's first trial of ""an innovative concept for fast and safe money transactions over the Internet"" and would use the GSM network for Internet access.
The system aims to allow Internet users to buy services and access information using so-called ""smart cards"" such as that developed by Mondex the electronic cash-card company.
Wilson said banks were top of the list of possible users for the system, pointing out the economies of internet banking compared to traditional retail banking which has to pay the cost of maintaining a branch network.
""The economic justification for banks is significant,"" he said, adding that the system would give users a direct connection to their bank and cash could then be issued onto the card.
The initial pilot is being carried out with National Westminster Bank Plc, he said.
As well as banking, another key use for this system was to pay for information, anonymously, on the Internet, without having to reveal credit card details.
Wilson said the project was effectively putting cash registers and ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) onto the Internet.
Users will be able to use handheld network computers, such as Apple's MessagePad 2000 with built-in GSM and Internet access, to make use of the system.
Craig Sears-Black, head of Apple's information appliances division, said ""The project is going to be a trial which tells us what the future holds for this type of transaction over the Internet"".
He said the protocols developed were the first to make very low cost transactions, such as retrieving restaurant reviews or individual newspaper articles, viable.
In Britain, the trial is teaming up with London listings magazine Time Out, which will sell on-line information on restaurants and entertainment.
It is also going to be connected to a map service provided by Multimedia Mapping which will give users precision maps directly relating to the Time Out information.
"
AlexanderSmith,"Regent Pacific, the Hong-Kong based fund which last month took a three percent stake in Britain's Hambros, said it was reassured by a meeting with chief executive Sir Chips Keswick that its profits would improve.
""It was useful to sit down and spend a little time with them. I left with the impression that the company's profits will improve,"" Julian Mayo, director of Regent Pacific Corporate Finance in London told Reuters.
A spokesman for British investment bank Hambros Plc declined to comment on the meeting but Mayo said it was ""friendly, business-like and constructive.""
Regent, often called a ""vulture fund,"" received widespread attention last month when it made the Hambros buy.
Its chief Jim Mellon was widely quoted as saying the bank, one the last few British independent investment banks, was undervalued and undermanaged. He was also reported to have said the bank's shares had been ""diabolical"" over the last 10 years.
This attack got a cool response from Hambros, which said it would meet Regent but would not otherwise comment on its new shareholder or its intentions.
Mayo said he had gone into the meeting wanting to hear what Hambros' strategy was going forward, how the bank was planning to coninue its policy of rationalisation and restructuring and when shareholders would see the fruits of it.
Asked if he was happy with the answers he received, Mayo said ""Yes, in broad terms.""
But he was less clear about Regent Pacific's long term aims in buying into Hambros, which like other British merchant banks has been the subject of takeover speculation in the past.
""Our motives are to make a good return from this investment, whether it is short or long term remains to be seen,"" Mayo said, adding that the group liked to have good relations with a company in which it invests and this was not a one-off meeting.
""We were left with the impression that the door is always open,"" Mayo said.
Regent Pacific's action had, he said highlighted what a number of analysts had been saying for some time about Hambros' performance. Undervaluation of the shares and discussions with analysts had prompted the decision to buy into Hambros, he said.
He said some analysts thought the bank's shares could rise to between 300 and 325 pence, closer to its potential value.
Hambros shares closed at 260.5 pence on Tuesday, up a penny. There was speculative buying late in August after Regent Pacific's holding became public with the share price reaching a year high of 280 pence.
But talk of a takeover or a possible break-up of the bank was dismissed by analysts at the time as unlikely in the near term, although some said it had a better break-up value.
Mayo said Regent could not launch a bid for Hambros but said a greater holding in the company was ""not out of the question,"" although it would have to notify both the bank and the stock exchange if it did buy a more significant stake.
""Whether we increase our position is something we will have to decide upon,"" he said.
In 1995 Hambros' pre-tax profits fell to 20.6 million pounds from 37.1 million the year before. Bad debt provisions grew to 36.2 million from 13.5 million pounds during the period.
"
AlexanderSmith,"NatWest Markets is expected to deal firmly with anyone found to have been responsible for its 50 million pound ($80.2 million) loss on interest rate options.
Sackings, demotions and bonus cuts are among the penalties banking sources have suggested NatWest could hand down when it releases a preliminary report into the affair on Thursday.
NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc, revealed the embarrassing hole in its interest rate options book nearly two weeks ago.
A NatWest Markets spokeswoman declined to comment on the precise timing of the early findings of its internal probe, which have been widely expected to emerge this week.
She said she could not comment on a newspaper report suggesting bonuses could be cut but confirmed the results of the inquiry ""may have a financial impact on certain individuals"".
NatWest has hired accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines to assist it in finding out how the options ""mispricing errors"" went unnoticed for so long.
Options are contracts which give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price on a set date in the future.
A former NatWest trader, widely believed to be Kyriacos Papouis, has been reported by NatWest to British financial markets regulator the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA).
And a senior NatWest trader, Neil Dodgson, has been suspended for allegedly ""failing to supervise"", pending the outcome of the probe.
Dodgson, who has not spoken about the case, was not immediately available for comment.
Papouis left NatWest in December last year for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns. He resigned from Bear Stearns last week and has not commented on his role in the NatWest affair. There has been no suggestion there was any personal gain involved, but the affair has raised deep concerns about NatWest's internal risk management.
Bear Stearns last week declined to give any details of the Papouis resignation, except to say it had conducted a thorough review of his open trading positions and was satisfied they were all booked and managed properly.
Britain's SFA has been notified of the NatWest internal inquiry and has opened a file, while the Bank of England has said it is co-operating with SFA.
On Tuesday the Bank of England, which supervises the NatWest group, said it was being kept informed of developments by NatWest.
NatWest Markets said it was undertaking a thorough review of its control systems, both internal and external.
Banking sources and British newspaper reports said this has involved examining the workings of both its interest rate derivatives department and its compliance division.
Jean-Francois Nguyen is head of interest rate derivatives at NatWest Markets. At the time of the mispricing errors, he reported to the then head of debt capital markets Phil Wise.
The Times on Thursday reported that NatWest's computer-based risk models had not been fed with accurate information which would have enabled any excessively risky positions to be identified.
A key question likely to be asked of senior NatWest officials is why the firm did not reveal the loss when it announced its 1996 results only days before it made the surprise announcement.
NatWest said it had brought the loss to the market's attention as soon as it came to light, but some banking sources questioned why the loss had not been picked up when the firm prepared its 1996 accounts.

AlexanderSmith,"British investment bank Schroders Plc said on Wednesday it was working towards an improvement in returns from its merchant banking business.
""Our objective is to see...returns from that business improve,"" Schroders' vice-chairman Peter Sedgwick told Reuters.
He said Schroders had been through a year of ""very substantial structural changes"" and had built up and invested in its securities business.  
Earlier the group reported pre-tax profits for 1996 of 238.7 million stg, at the top of analyst's expectations and an increase on 197.3 million stg in 1995.
Sedgwick said the investment in securities was not the reason for an increase in costs at Schroders. ""The increase in costs is not down to securities, it is across the board,"" he said.
He said there had been some restructuring of the group's corporate finance business in South East Asia and an expansion of its geographical exposure in continental Europe, particularly Spain and Germany.  
""We have been integrating corporate finance with securities throughout the world...we are looking for what has been taking place in the last year to pay off for us to a greater extent over the next year or two,"" he added.
But he felt the investment and merchant banking side of the business ""has performed reasonably well against the changes in strategy that have been taking place here"".
Sedgwick said the bulk of the cost of this strategy change had been borne in 1996. ""We would not expect to see the same increase in costs this year,"" he said.  
Schroders said in its results statement that other factors driving up costs had been increased volumes, the cost of regulation and ""not least by competitive conditions for staff"".
Sedgwick pointed out that staff costs per employee had risen to 93,300 stg from 78,500 stg the previous year. Schroders' cost/income ratio was 75 percent, compared to 75.4 pct in 1995.
He said Schroders' profits, both pre and post tax, were up by over 20 percent but bonuses had risen slightly below this in total.  
Spiralling bonuses in the industry as a whole were, he said, the result of a battle going on between a number of major investment banking players to become one of the five or six global powerhouses.
""Sooner or later the damage that some will suffer (means) they will withdraw and the cycle will change,"" he said, adding that Schroders did not count itself among this group.
He said many were desperate to get into asset management, where Schroders posted an improved return in 1996, as they did not have the balanced portfolio Schroders did.
Sedgwick said the firm was an ""advisory-relationship type investment bank"" and was not heavily dependent on proprietory trading, has a strong balance sheet, no borrowing, cash reserves and a good asset management business.
He said Schroders was not aiming to be a Merrill Lynch or a Goldman Sachs. ""It is not our strategy to be in that game.""
And commenting on long-standing speculation that Schroders could be involved in a merger or a takeover by a larger firm, Sedgwick said ""There is absolutely no intention of changing Schroders as is. We are not up for sale, we are not out for merger, we do not want a big brother and we are not in the acquisition stakes.""
""We are not in the business of losing our independence,"" he said, adding that Schroders would grow organically.

AlexanderSmith,"Britain's NatWest Bank revealed on Thursday its multi-million pound derivatives losses were nearly twice as large as first thought and that they began in 1994.
A wide-ranging probe into the loss also led to drastic action, including suspension of four senior employees and the withdrawal of millions of pounds in staff bonuses.
NatWest said the total loss was 90 million pounds ($144 million) but that five million had already been provisioned and eight million had been clawed back by not paying the bonuses, making a loss of 77 million pounds in the accounts. And Martin Owen, chief executive of the NatWest Markets investment banking division, will forego 200,000 of his 500,000 pounds 1996 bonus in a gesture to the industry.
""He has waived his bonus in recognition of his overall responsibility for the business. He believes he has made the gesture as an example to the industry,"" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.
Owen said it was unacceptable that the losses, which had resulted from options being wrongly priced systematically but stemmed from an initial interest rate options loss, had not been unearthed earlier. He said the problem came to light as a result of procedural changes to the way trading positions and valuations are checked. ""It has gone on (during) a long period; that is clearly unacceptable against the background of incidents in other firms as well. Fortunately, it does seem to be isolated to this area,"" Owen said. Although his role has come under scrutiny, NatWest's overall head Derek Wanless told Reuters he had complete confidence in Owen but the loss had been a setback for him in one area. The bank would learn lessons and emerge stronger, he added.
The staff suspensions, which have been notified to Britain's financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), followed the suspension of global head of options Neil Dodgson when the problem first came to light nearly two weeks ago.
A former NatWest options trader, Kyriacos Papouis, has also been reported to the SFA, which confirmed it was examining the conduct of all six. NatWest said its requests to interview Papouis had so far been ignored.
The initial findings of NatWest's inquiry, carried out by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines, found no flaws in the models used to calculate valuations.
Owen said details of how the mispricings went unnoticed for so long would be examined in the second phase of an internal inquiry.
He could not say if the initial options loss was the result of an individual's actions and could not comment on whether the subsequent mispricings had been intentional. ""I don't want to prejudge the second phase of the report because we are really deep into the examination of all the individuals associated with it. The degree to which there was collusion or not is something which is being examined,"" he said.
But further disciplinary action could follow from the report's second stage, he said.
Those suspended were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets. NatWest stressed these suspensions were normal practice in such cases and did not imply guilt. Peter Hall, President and Chief Operating Officer of NatWest Markets, will temporarily take on the additional responsibilities of Chief Administrative Officer. Vincent Tomasi currently Senior Vice President and Head of US Debt Capital Markets at NatWest Markets in New York will take over as acting Head of Global Debt Derivatives. The bank said that a new management structure it had intended to put into place following its 1996 acquisition of U.S. bond trading house Greenwich Capital and the creation of a global debt markets division would now be accelerated. NatWest is continuing to keep bank regulator the Bank of England closely informed, and the second phase of the inquiry would take place as quickly as possible, concentrating on the role of individuals, Owen said.

AlexanderSmith,"NatWest Bank  admitted on Thursday that its multi-million pound derivatives losses totalled nearly twice the amount initially thought and revealed the problem had begun as long ago as December 1994.
As a result of initial findings of a wide-ranging internal probe into the loss, the bank also took drastic action to restore confidence by suspending four senior members of staff and cutting millions of pounds from bonuses.
NatWest said the total loss was 90 million pounds ($144 million) but that five million had already been provisioned and eight million had been clawed back by not paying the bonuses, making a loss of 77 million pounds in the accounts.
It also said Martin Owen, chief executive of the NatWest Markets investment banking division, would forego 200,000 pounds of his 500,000 pounds 1996 bonus.
""It is extremely regrettable that the losses and the mis-pricing have gone undetected for so long. Although confined to one area this is a significant setback for NatWest Markets,"" Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, said.
The bank said the losses had started in late 1994 and were confined to its interest rate options area. It said it had suspended four more members of staff, appointed an acting head of global debt derivatives and would not pay bonuses totalling 8.0 million pounds to certain members of staff.
The bank said the initial findings of an inquiry into the losses, which were first revealed nearly two weeks ago, had found no flaws in the models used to calculate valuations of the derivatives in question.
Neil Dodgson, global head of options, has already been suspended and options trader Kyriacos Papouis left the firm in December.
It said the further suspensions were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets.

Vincent Tomasi currently Senior Vice President and Head of US Debt Capital Markets at NatWest Markets in New York will take over as acting Head of Global Debt Derivatives.
Owen said he was disappointed by the ""serious deficiency revealed in the interest rate options area.""
NatWest said the second stage of the review being undertaken by lawyers Linklaters &amp; Paines and accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand will involve the further investigation of the areas where the losses happened.
It said it would also mount an investigation of the management issues associated with the deficiencies in these areas.

AlexanderSmith,"Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets, said on Thursday it was unacceptable that the investment bank had lost 77 million stg through the systematic mispricing of interest rate options since 1994.
""It has gone on (during) a long period; that is clearly unacceptable against the background of incidents in other firms as well. Fortunately, it does seem to be isolated to this area,"" Owen told Reuters in response to a question on why the problem had not been unearthed in the wake of the collapse of Barings in February 1995.  
Owen said details of how the mispricings went unnoticed for so long would be examined in the second phase of an internal inquiry.
The first stage found that a loss initially put at 50 million stg two weeks ago was in fact 90 million stg, although this was before a 5.0 million stg provision and 8.0 million NatWest said it would claw back in bonuses which would not be paid.
Owen said he was adamant NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc, would learn lessons from it.  
He said the next phase would examine information flows, internal controls and the responses of individuals to internal and external audit reports.
""All of these things will be examined now in some detail. I clearly do not want to have a debate in the public arena about it. These are going to be internal issues,"" Owen added.
A total of five members of staff have now been suspended as a result of the options loss and one trader has already left the firm.
Owen said he could not say if the initial options loss was the result of an individual's actions and could not comment on whether the subsequent mispricings had been intentional.  
""I don't want to prejudge the second phase of the report because we are really deep into the examination of all the individuals associated with it. The degree to which there was collusion or not is something which is being examined,"" he said.
But further disciplinary action could follow from the report's second stage, he said.
Owen said the suspensions so far were ""a normal process, not intended to imply guilt"", adding that they would put people in a position where they were free to cooperate with the inquiry team.
""You can imagine in a business such as NatWest Markets that people hold significant delegations of authority. Therefore we must be absolutely sure of their role before we can restore them,"" he added.  
Owen said NatWest was continuing to keep the Bank of England closely informed and had received the initial report, adding that the firm was ""driving the situation as a management issue"".
He said the second phase of the inquiry would take place as quickly as possible. Accounting records and pricing methodology had already been examined in some depth but the motivation of individuals still had to be examined.
Options trader Kyriacos Papouis, who left NatWest Markets last December, had not yet been interviewed by the firm. Papouis left for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns, but last week resigned from his position there too.
""We have made requests to interview him and have received no response,"" Owen said, adding that Neil Dodgson, global head of options, had been interviewed as part of the inquiry.  
Owen said the losses, which were first announced only days after NatWest 1996 results but had apparently not been noticed for more than two years, had surfaced as part of ongoing process of examining trading positions and book valuations.
""It was revealed as part of the process of looking at that. There were certain procedural changes that occurred which then this particular issue to our attention. Unfortunately it came to our attention after the group's results were announced,"" he added.
Asked if NatWest Markets would take action against its auditors, Owen said the role of individuals, both internally and externally, would be examined in the next stage of the probe.
Owen acknowledged the loss was a set-back and that confidence in a proper system of controls was a core competency for a complex investment bank. he said he was committed to learning valuable lessons across the organisation, adding there was no evidence that any NatWest client had suffered losses as a result.

AlexanderSmith,"A turbulent week for NatWest Markets ended on Friday with a shake-up of its global debt markets arm and the departure of three senior staff.
But the investment banking arm of British banking giant National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) stressed that there was no link with 90 million pounds ($144 million) in losses also reported this week.
These were built up over two years in interest rate options after systematic mispricings of the derivatives.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office said it was monitoring the options situation but was not investigating the losses, which the Bank of England and the financial markets watchdog, the Securities and Futures Authority, are scrutinising.
The management shake-up in NatWest's debt markets division marks a shift in power to managers from Greenwich Capital, the U.S. bond house it bought last year.
""The co-chief executives of the new global debt markets division are Gary Holloway and Chip Kruger,"" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters. Both joined NatWest when it bought Greenwich Capital.
Two casualties of the reshuffle were senior NatWest managers, Johan Hattingh and Alby Cator. The firm has also had to cope with the departure of its European equity derivatives head Roger Nagioff to Lehman Brothers and reports that staff morale is low.
Hattingh was European fixed income head and Cator managing director of European primary markets. Hattingh had been at NatWest Markets since 1993 when he joined from Japan's IBJ.
""Their departures are as a result of the restructuring of the debt markets division,"" the spokeswoman said when asked if the two had been made redundant by NatWest.
NatWest said Holloway would be based in Greenwich in the United States and would be responsible for the U.S. and Asian operations. Kruger would be London-based and responsible for European debt market operations.
Greg Bowes, who built up Greenwich's London business before the NatWest takeover, becomes head of government bonds, repos and futures and options.
Other key appointments are Frank Canelas, who will head corporate bonds origination, sales, trading and research, Bruce Snider who becomes head of asset-backed origination, structuring and trading and Phil Lotz, chief administrative officer for operations, IT and finance.
The NatWest spokeswoman said the shake-up played to both NatWest's and Greenwich's strengths. The changes, which were announced internally on Thursday, have created 10 main areas of responsibility within the debt markets division.
A number of NatWest managers kept key roles within the new framework. These included Graham Rendell in acquisition finance, housing finance and syndicated loans, and Simon Collins, who continues as head of debt structuring and structured finance.
Gary Mulgrew and Gordon McKechnie jointly head project finance, structured trade finance, and leasing and asset finance. George Trott and Martin Jaskel head debt origination for corporates and all financial institutions. Neil Coulbeck remains responsible for business management and portfolio administration.
NatWest's embarrassing losses in its global debt derivatives division have led to the suspension of five senior employees, bonus cuts totalling eight million pounds for a handful of staff and chief executive Martin Owen cutting his own bonus.
One banking source described the $590 million Greenwich purchase as being ""effectively a reverse takeover"" aimed at imposing Greenwich's bond expertise and experience over parts of NatWest's existing team, which had been struggling to build up its business in some areas.
The source also said the discovery of the options losses, which were first revealed two weeks ago, had been a result of auditing changes made by Greenwich managers.
On Thursday NatWest's Owen told Reuters that the interest rate options losses, which began in late 1994, had surfaced as a result of ""certain procedural changes"".
At the time of the Greenwich purchase, NatWest's Owen said it plugged a major gap in the group's investment banking strategy and would meet demand from clients for firms able to offer the broadest possible range of global fixed income products.
"
AlexanderSmith,"NatWest Markets detailed on Friday a shake-up of its global debt markets wing, shifting power to managers from Greenwich Capital, the U.S. bond house it bought last year.
The changes, which are not linked to revelations of 90 million pound ($144 million) losses by the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc in its options business, have established Greenwich managers in key positions.
""The co-chief executives of the new global debt markets division are Gary Holloway and Chip Kruger,"" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that two senior NatWest managers, Johan Hattingh and Alby Cator, had left as part of the changes.
Holloway and Kruger are from Greenwich Capital. Holloway will be based in Greenwich in the United States and will be responsible for the U.S. and Asian operations. Kruger will be London-based and responsible for European debt market operations.

""Their departures are as a result of the restructuring of the debt markets division,"" the spokeswoman said when asked if the two had been made redundant by NatWest.
Hattingh had been at NatWest Markets since 1993 when he joined from Japan's IBJ. With the integration of Greenwich, Hattingh was joined in European fixed income by Greg Bowes.
NatWest's embarrassing losses in its global debt derivatives division have led to the suspension of five senior employees and bonus cuts totalling eight million pounds for a handful of staff.
Chief executive Martin Owen cutting his own bonus and the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and Bank of England are looking into what went wrong at the firm.
One banking source described the effect of the $590 million Greenwich purchase as being ""effectively a reverse takeover"" for debt markets aimed at imposing Greenwich's bond expertise and experience over parts of NatWest's existing team, which had been struggling to build up its business in some areas.
The source also said the discovery of the options losses, which were first announced two weeks ago, had been a direct result of auditing changes implemented by Greenwich managers.
On Thursday NatWest's Owen told Reuters that the interest rate options losses, which began in late 1994, had surfaced as a result of ""certain procedural changes"".
At the time of the Greenwich buy, NatWest's Owen said it plugged a major gap in the group's investment banking strategy and would meet demand from clients for firms able to offer the broadest possible range of global fixed income products.
Owen said Greenwich would give NatWest access to the world's biggest market -- U.S. Treasuries -- and the growing asset backed area. NatWest already had U.S. mergers and acquisitions advisory capacity in the form of Gleacher NatWest.
"
AlexanderSmith,"NatWest Markets said on Monday that its senior management did not know about the interest rate options pricing problem until three days before the losses were made public.
""Senior management did not know until February 25 that there was potentially something of significance,"" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.
She denied a weekend newspaper report suggesting that NatWest, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc knew of the losses some time before they were revealed.
The mispricings, which on Thursday NatWest revealed had totalled 90 million pounds ($144 million), had come to light during the course of normal pricing reviews and it had not been able to put a price on the loss until February 28, when NatWest estimated it at 50 million pounds.
The initial discovery of the loss came to light through a more intensive review across the investment bank's trading areas, but it was a month or so before the extent of the mispricings became clear.
The options losses have been a painful and embarrassing episode for NatWest Markets and its chief executive Martin Owen, who on Thursday said he would forgo 200,000 of a 500,000 pound bonus as a result of the affair.
NatWest confirmed a report that the girlfriend of Kyriacos Papouis, the former NatWest options trader whom NatWest wants to interview about the losses, also worked for the bank but was employed in derivatives marketing and had nothing to do with Papouis's work.
She had been given a holiday period because of the situation, the spokeswoman added.
Papouis, who left NatWest for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns, has not commented on the losses. Since the affair came to light he has also resigned from Bear Stearns.
He and five others have been reported to British financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and the Bank of England is also looking into what went wrong at the bank.
NatWest Markets' global head of options, Neil Dodgson, who was suspended from the firm more than two weeks ago when the losses first came to light, is among those who will come under SFA scrutiny.
The others suspended last week were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives, and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets.
While the group has maintained that it does not believe any of its clients suffered losses as a result of the options mispricing, which went back as far as 1994, the spokeswoman declined to comment on whether NatWest would try to recoup any gains made by counterparties to any wrongly priced deals.
""We haven't determined that that is an issue,"" she said.
She dismissed suggestions that morale was low at the bank following last week's revelation that the loss was nearly twice as large as initially thought, the suspension of four senior staff and the cutting of bonuses to a handful of individuals.
""We are doing really good business here, and we continue to do good business. Everybody wants this to be dealt with properly and put behind us,"" she said.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which investigates and prosecutes major and complex financial crime, has been contacted by NatWest but has not begun an investigation.

AlexanderSmith,"British property group Hammerson Plc's chief executive Ron Spinney said on Monday he expected the British market to perform well over the next two years.
""I think the market will perform well over the next two years,"" Spinney told Reuters.
Earlier the group announced a 21.3 percent rise in pre-tax profit for 1996 to 70.0 million stg from 1995's 57.7 million stg. Net asset value (NAV) per share rose 3.2 percent to 388 pence from 376 pence.  
Spinney said Hammerson had had ""another good year"", including turning over 15 percent of the portfolio, investing 50 million stg on improving existing properties and embarking on an 800 million stg development programme.
He said the group would be spending around 115 million stg on its existing portfolio and its developments.
""We have taken steps to ensure growth in the future...The UK market for shopping centres and offices is bouyant,"" he added.  
Spinney said there were signs the French market was in a similar position to where the British market had been about two years before, adding he was confident there had been rises in values since the end of the year in Britain.
Hammerson's gearing is currently ""relatively modest"" at 58 percent, Spinney said, adding that the group itended acquiring more properties over the year, this would be split between areas and sectors.
""We are generally happy with it (the split) as it is at the present time,"" he said.
"
AlexanderSmith,"Volatile markets, a scramble for profits and the emergence of new financial tools have all contributed to recent investment banking failures, the head of Britain's financial markets watchdog said on Tuesday.
""We've got a very volatile market, people (are) spending a lot of time on profitability and market share but we are saying you have got to spend as much time also concentrating on control and compliance,"" Nick Durlacher, chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) told Reuters.
Earlier the SFA said it would not publish controversial changes to its rules -- making top executives more responsible for a major failure -- until it was clear they were in line with standards being proposed by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the top financial regulator under Britain's complicated system.
Durlacher said the growth of derivatives over the last 10 years had posed new management problems as those now ""sitting on top of the pile"" had no first-hand experience of these instruments.
""These are without doubt posing control problems,"" Durlacher said, adding that senior managers were also making ""old fashioned mistakes"".
A ""booming industry"" and a very volatile job market compounded these problems. ""We're just saying 'don't forget about the controls',"" he added.
Bonuses and the problems inherent in the so-called ""star system"" were also factors which firms needed to think about, Durlacher said.
Durlacher said the SFA's outline proposals, first announced last September, to make senior executive officers take greater responsibility in the event of a ""catastrophic failure"" in their firm had prompted other regulators to address the issues.
He admitted that Tuesday's announcement that the SFA would wait for the SIB to catch up before pursuing its proposals had slowed the watchdog down but said it had done as much as it could.
""Under normal circumstances we would either have published a rule change, or we might have done this given the weight of comment, had one further and last consultation with a clear indication of when we would publish a rule change.
Durlacher said there had been ""an awful lot of comment"" on the proposals and it was now happy about how it would like the changes to be made, although there could be a final brief consultation on it.
He said he hoped the proposals would be finalised by the end of April, adding that he was reminded daily of the urgency for changes by newspaper reports indicating ""how important it is that management pay attention to control and compliance in their businesses"".
Durlacher said the SFA's disciplining of senior executives at Barings, the British merchant bank which collapsed under huge derivatives losses in February 1995, had been ""a long and difficult process"" and in one case had set a precendent.
It was the SFA's decision not to pursue Barings' chairman Peter Baring and deputy chairman Andrew Tuckey which prompted it to revise its rules on management responsibility.
Durlacher said that regardless of the role of Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson whose unauthorised trades crippled the bank, the demise of Barings was ultimately due to the fact that its executives ""had forgotten how to bank"".
He said the question of reversing the burden of proof, so that senior executive officers would have to show that they had done everything they could to avoid a disaster, was the hardest thing for the SFA to resolve and had received most criticism.
But he was confident it would ultimately go through. ""We believe there remains a requirement that we do concentrate people's minds on the responsibilities they hold in these very important positions,"" he said.
"
AlexanderSmith,"The head of Britain's financial markets watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) said on Tuesday that former Barings treasury chief Ian Hopkins had broken precendent in refusing to be bound by SFA rules.
Last week the SFA banned Hopkins from being a director in the City for at least three years for his part in the 1995 collapse of the blue-blooded British merchant bank. Nick Leeson, the Singapore-based trader whose unauthorised trading led to losses of nearly $1.4 billion, is currently serving a jail sentence for his role in the affair.
Hopkins was also ordered to pay 10,000 pounds ($15,800) towards the SFA's costs after an independent tribunal found that he was no longer ""a fit and proper person"" to be a director of an SFA regulated firm.
""Its been difficult for us because it has been without precedent. We've never had to confront this before when someone signed a contract with us to be bound by our rules and then in effect ignored them,"" Nick Durlacher, the SFA's chairman, told Reuters.
Hopkins, one of nine Barings executives to have been disciplined by the SFA, has always protested that the attempted to ""blow the whistle"" on irregularities in the Singapore operation but that other managers ignored his warnings.
""I think the tribunal judged that if Mr Hopkins was a whistle blower he didn't have much of a pea in his whistle,"" Durlacher said, adding that Hopkins ""had lived with an unreconciled balance of 100 million pounds for three months"".
Durlacher said he was ""not vitriolic"" about Hopkins although he said it had not been easy. But if anyone adopted the same approach in the future, the SFA ""would adopt the same process of being as scrupulously fair as we can"".
He strongly denied that Hopkins had been dealt with more harshly than others because of his refusal to recognise the SFA's authority over him. Hopkins told British newspapers after the ruling that it had been vindictive.
Durlacher also denied that he had offered Hopkins a deal as it would not have been up to him to do so anyway. He said he had only had one telephone conversation with him and had been very careful about what he said.
""What I did say to Mr Hopkins was that I encouraged him to argue his case in front of us rather than to ignore us,"" he said, adding this could either have involved arguing his case at a tribunal or to considering settling with the SFA, as seven of the other Barings executives disciplined by the SFA had done.
Only one Barings case is now outstanding. Ron Baker, who was head of financial products at the firm, is appealing against an SFA tribunal's decision to reprimand him over his monitoring of one part of Barings' proprietory trading activities. ($ = 0.630 British Pounds)

AlexanderSmith,"A small but fast-growing bank which lends only to socially and environmentally-friendly projects said on Wednesday it had more than doubled in size in its first full year in Britain.
Independently-owned Triodos Bank, which was founded in the Netherlands in 1980 and now has offices in Britain and Belgium, lends only to what it describes as projects ""with social and environmental objectives"".
It said its level of savings in Britain had grown by 111 percent in 1996 to 20.2 million pounds ($32.1 million) from 11.3 million pounds in 1995 and its loan portfolio by 117 percent to 10.2 million pounds from 5.6 million pounds.
""We are delighted with our first year's results in the UK. We are continuing to see substantial interest from both savers and borrowers looking for a positive ethical approach to banking,"" said Glen Saunders, the bank's managing director in Britain.
While Britain's big six high street banks have reported combined profits of 12.6 billion pounds in 1996, up from 10.8 billion pounds in 1995, Triodos earlier said its net profit for the year was a mere 342,000 pounds, up from 262,000 the previous year.
But Triodos now has 2,598 savings accounts in Britain compared to 1,358 at the end of 1995. It has attracted British media interest after launching new types of savings accounts and funds promoting fair trade during 1996.
The bank, whose British operation was started in Bristol in the west of England in July 1995, said the growth had been secured on a threefold increase in its capital base, following a share issue in the Netherlands.
A significant proportion of the new shareholding came from Dutch and Belgian financial institutions, including Rabobank Nederland and Commercial Union subsidiary Delta Lloyd.
Saunders said this influx of non-voting shareholders had shown ""increasing mainstream recognition"" of the bank's ""experience in lending to the social economy"".
The bank has so far lent to projects including a wind farm in Cumbria, north-west England, and organic milk suppliers co-operative, an environmentally-friendly housing development in a Welsh national park and a housing association which provides homes for people with special needs.
Triodos has also become involved in so-called ""microcredit"" programmes in developing countries, where it lends to impoverished people to develop projects which then generate income, helping them to work their way out of poverty.
""Microcredit is sensitive to the local economy, does not create dependency and is self-sustaining as the money repaid is 'recycled' to other borrowers,"" Triodos said in a background statement.
The bank, which had only 62 staff at the end of 1996, has also branched out into specialised fund management, including funds managed on behalf of charities and governments.
Its Green Investment Fund, established last year, has raised 8.0 million pounds for investment in recognised ""green"" enterprises while the Wind Fund has raised around 4.0 million for investment in wind farms and other renewable energy projects.
The bank's combined balance sheet, which includes its Dutch and Belgian operations, grew by 54 percent in 1996 to reach 161.9 million pounds at the end of the year.

AlexanderSmith,"Michael Marks, chairman of British stockbroking firm Smith New Court before it was taken over by Merrill Lynch, was on Thursday elevated to a new European role in a restructuring of the U.S. investment bank.
Marks, who according to recent newspaper reports was paid a bonus of four million pounds ($6.4 million), has been made chief operating officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
He was most recently co-head of global equities and will remain as deputy chairman of Merrill Lynch International. His appointment comes into force on June 16.
Marks told Reuters the ""realignment"" emphasised the importance of London as a financial centre.
""We run the Europe, Middle East and Africa region from London and the City (of London) is becoming of increasing importance. This move further underlines the importance of London in the region,"" he said.
Marks said the business has previously been run along global product lines and Merrill was now attempting to run it by global products and regionally.
Merrill Lynch International will still have a co-ordinating role to make sure clients are being well served, he added.
Under the new structure there will now be five chief operating officers for Merrill's international regions. The others are Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada, Japan and finally Australia and New Zealand.
Kevin Watts, who was head of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, has been made chief operating officer for the Asia-Pacific region.
The changes mean Merrill will now be made up of a U.S. private client group, an international private client group, an asset management group and a corporate and institutional client group.
It was previously divided into two main areas, private client and corporate and institutional client.
Merrill said the ""organisational realignment"" was designed to ""enhance services provided to a diverse global client base and position the company for the substantial worldwide growth opportunities in financial services"".
Marks, 55, who began his career in the City of London with Smith Brothers in 1960, became chief executive of Smith New Court in 1987 and chairman early in 1995.
He joined Merrill when it took over Smith New Court in September 1995 and has widely been viewed as central to attempts to integrate the two firms and their differing cultures.
This culture clash has led to staff leaving the firm. Last year Marks said 100 employees had left Merrill's investment banking division over the year. But others have suggested the number of defections was much larger.
Merrill is on the look-out for a new London headquarters to bring together the former Smith New Court operations which are situated northwest of the City and its own which are closer to the capital's traditional financial heartland.
The firm has not confirmed its final choice for a new home but recent reports said it had settled on an imposing former post office building close to St Paul's Cathedral.
Other options which it has considered are a move to Docklands, the former docks to the east of the City, or an expansion of Merrill's existing Ropemaker Place building to an adjacent site. Insiders say senior executives at the firm favour staying in the City.
Marks has been a member of the board of the London Stock Exchange since 1994.

BenjaminKangLim,"A group of 56 Chinese writers, former officials and academics has petitioned Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin to save cultural relics from the gigantic Three Gorges dam which would flood huge tracts of land.
Ancient tombs and temples were threatened by a dearth of government funds and official under-reporting of those relics that warranted saving, according to the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters on Tuesday.
""The hearts of relic protection departments are like burning fire with 10,000 worries and misgivings,"" it said of the lack of funds.
About 130 historical sites, some of them dating to the Stone Age, could be flooded as soon as next year.
The sites include Qing dynasty (1644-1911) temples, an entire street from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and stone carvings from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).
Relocation of many relics had been delayed due to lack of funds, the letter said, adding that the damage would worsen unless government funds for relocation were provided.
The letter dated August 8 was signed by prominent female writer Bing Xin, former ambassador to the United States Chai Zemin and former minister of culture Wang Meng.
Others include Su Bingqi, president of the Archaeological Society, and Yu Weichao, curator of the Museum of Chinese History who is in charge of relocating relics.
Archaeologists had designated 829 buried relics near a reservoir under construction as needing protection. The sites covered a total area of more than 20 million square metres (215 million square ft), but the government has agreed to protect one tenth of the area due to a lack of funds, it said.
Some ancient tombs and relics have already disappeared under the onslaught of bulldozers, the letter said.
Construction of the controversial dam was expected to submerge 632 square km (244 square miles) of land in central China's Hubei province and the southwestern province of Sichuan.
It would force the relocation of 840,000 people from up to 200 villages and towns, according to 1991-92 estimates.
Environmentalists have described the project as a potential ecological disaster, leading to the destruction of a scenic mountain region and the extinction of endangered species.
The Three Gorges dam -- the world's biggest water control project --  was expected to ease seasonal flooding by creating a massive reservoir in Hubei to store waters from rains.
The 6,000-km (3,500-mile) Yangtze river -- China's longest -- and its tributaries have triggered floods throughout much of China's history.
The project, expected to cost $30 billion by its completion in 2009, would also help ease China's crippling shortage of electric power.
"
BenjaminKangLim,"The Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) on Wednesday appealed for food aid for flood-hit North Korea, predicting disaster by the end of the year if relief did not arrive.
""The country is running out of food...they are emptying their warehouses now,"" Ole Gronning of Denmark, IFRC representative in North Korea, said in an interview in Beijing.
""We will have a human disaster at the end of the year if the food (aid) is not coming,"" said Gronning, who had been in North Korea since last November. ""(By) July...there will be no food in the country.""
Devastating floods in 1995 and 1996 left half a million North Koreans homeless out of a total of 23 million, according to relief organisations.
The floods have struck hard at the economy of the hermit communist state, destroying rice fields, roads, factories and livestock and swamping mines.
North Korea was forecast to consume 5.5 million tonnes of grain in 1997, but Pyongyang feared a shortfall of 45 percent, or up to 2.5 million tonnes, Gronning said.
""We already now know that the harvest will not be successful...,"" he said.
On Monday, North Korea admitted that it had only half the grain needed to feed its people.
Food rations across North Korea had dropped to less than a quarter of the level normally considered essential to maintain a healthy population, Gronning said.
There was no indication yet of famine but grain rations had been cut to 100 grams (3.5 ounces) per person a day -- equivalent to 900 calories -- from 450 grams (15.9 ounces).
""Signs of malnutrition are there,"" he said.
The IFRC aimed to raise $10 million to feed 139,000 of the worst hit victims for 11 months through October this year, but so far only $1 million had been raised, Gronning said.
About 5.2 million North Koreans were directly affected by the 1995 floods and a further 3.3 million last year.
Two earlier appeals for funds totalling more than $10 million had largely been met.
Photographs taken by Gronning in North Korea showed what he said was arable land under one metre (yard) of sand.
About two percent of North Korea's farmland had been completely destroyed, covered with sand several metres deep, Gronning said. Lack of machinery made reclamation of sand-covered arable land difficult.
North Korea was ""very exposed"", he said, adding that floods and hailstorms could strike again.
Pyongyang's arch-rival South Korea has been one of the 25 donor countries, pledging 1,000 (corrects from 100,000) tonnes of wheat flour and 15,000 pairs of socks.
""South Korea is coming in very big this year,"" he said.
Seoul suspended food shipments to North Korea after accusing Pyongyang of landing 26 commandos from a submarine last September. All but two of the group died during a manhunt.
The aid resumed after North Korea apologised and South Korea returned the remains of the infiltrators.
In January, the United States gave permission to Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc, the world's largest private grain trading company, to export 500,000 tonnes of wheat or rice to North Korea in what was expected to be a barter agreement.

BenjaminKangLim,"China's propaganda machine had a field day on Thursday, lashing out at U.S. newspapers over accusations of torture and rape of Tibetan nuns and suggestions that the United States should get tough with China.
The overseas edition of the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, scoffed at accusations that Chinese authorities tortured, raped and murdered Tibetan nuns, monks and civilians in the restive Himalayan region.
""This series of articles in the Philadelphia Inquirer is weak to the extent that it is laughable,"" the newspaper said.
The Inquirer published last December a series of articles documenting what it said were stories of rape, torture and murder of Tibetan monks, nuns and ordinary people at the hands of Chinese authorities.
In the articles nearly two dozen cases were documented, including names and dates, from the Himalayan region that has been rocked in recent years by periodic anti-Chinese unrest led by monks and nuns seeking independence and the return of the exiled Dalai Lama.
""This is a critical story that lays bare the efforts by the (Chinese) government to wipe out the culture and religion of the Tibetan people through torture and worse,"" PRNewswire last December quoted Inquirer Editor Mawell E.P. King as saying.
International human rights groups have made similar accusations, quoting Tibetans who fled China.
China denied the accusations.
""One of the main reasons for the Philadelphia Inquirer and some U.S. media to repeatedly fabricate lies about Tibet is their strong bias, arrogance and conceitedness,"" the People's Daily said.
""Using the so-called Tibet problem to incite anti-Chinese sentiment is fashionable among the U.S. media,"" it said.
China's propaganda machine also took on the New York Times, despite a recent rapid warming in ties between Beijing and Washington that had deteriorated in 1995 and up to mid-1996.
""The venom of the New York Times editorial lies in the fact that it...seditiously creates an atmosphere that will poison the relationship between China and the United States at a time when there is a tendency toward improving the bilateral relations,"" the Xinhua news agency said.
""The Times' editorial writer has one special skill: the ability to confuse black and white and to call a deer a house,"" Xinhua said.
The New York Times suggested in a January 30 editorial that U.S. President Bill Clinton should get tough with China.
""The demise of Communism may come someday in China, but it would be a mistake to adopt a passive American policy based on that optimistic prospect, as Mr. Clinton seems to be doing,"" the Times said.
""There is already abundant evidence suggesting that Communism in China is not dying but is instead mutating into a new form that tolerates economic liberties while still suffocating political freedom,"" the Times said.
Xinhua said comparing in the same breath the collapse of the Berlin Wall with socialist China, which is prospering, was an ""incongruous comparison"" just as ""donkeys' lips don't match horses' jaws"".

BenjaminKangLim,"China has jailed two Mongolians for up to 15 years on charges of separatism and espionage, the London-based human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday.
Hada, 41, former manager of the Mongolian Academic Bookshop, and Tegexi, 30, who worked in the Inner Mongolian Bureau of Foreign Affairs, were sentenced last December to 15 and 10 years in prison respectively, Amnesty said.
Chinese courts rejected their appeals last month and upheld their original sentences, it said. The pair had been held for a year in solitary confinement without charges or a trial.
""No evidence has been made public to show that Hada and Tegexi were involved in any activity which may be regarded as criminal under international standards,"" Amnesty said.
It called for their immediate and unconditional release.
The Amnesty report could not be independently confirmed. Officials in China could not be reached for comment on the eve of Lunar New Year holidays.
Amnesty said eight others were detained in December for alleged involvement in ""nationalist separatist"" activities, but were subsequently released.
Inner Mongolia, a Chinese province, is populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians but there has been little sign of anti-Chinese unrest since the early years after the 1949 communist takeover and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when dissent was crushed.
However, in late 1995, authorities in Inner Mongolia arrested 12 people who had demanded more democracy and an autonomous region, according to human rights groups.
Hada and Tegexi were being detained in poor conditions and their health was suffering, Amnesty said. They were living in a cell in Inner Mongolia's Number One Prison with over 30 other people, the report added.
Hada has a recurrence of tuberculosis and his neck was swollen, the group said. It was not known if he had received any medical treatment in prison.
Beijing-based Western analysts say China has tightened its grip on dissent and separatist sentiment ahead of the British colony of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule on July 1.
""The harsh sentences passed on Hada and Tegexi are indicative of the severe attitude taken during the past year by the Chinese authorities towards suspected nationalists in...Tibet and Xinjiang,"" Amnesty said.
Inner Mongolia has traditionally been less restive than Tibet and Xinjiang.
Tibet has been rocked in recent years by periodic unrest, which China blames on the Himalayan region's god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India after an abortive uprising against communist rule in 1959.
Xinjiang borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states. The region has been shaken in recent months by several clashes and political killings involving separatists who want to end communist rule in Xinjiang.
""This 'crackdown' has also affected those whose peaceful religious activities are deemed to threaten 'national unity' and 'social stability',"" Amnesty said.

BenjaminKangLim,"Chinese authorities sealed off a town in northwestern Xinjiang and paramilitary police patrolled the streets after at least 10 people were killed in a separatist riot last week, residents said on Tuesday.
""No one can leave, no one can enter,"" one resident said by telephone from the mainly Moslem town of Yining in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the border with Kazakhstan.
Authorities closed the airport and railway station on Thursday and clamped an after-dark curfew on the town, residents said.
At least 10 people were killed, including one policeman, and some 100 wounded when 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining on Wednesday to protest against Beijing rule, Chinese sources and residents have said.
The riot was among the most violent for many years in the restive region of Xinjiang, where Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.
Shops and restaurants were closed in Yining and paramilitary police patrolled the streets. Police had arrested many suspects and were hunting other rioters, one Han woman resident said.
Hundreds of Uighurs had been arrested following the riot, said the leader of an exiled nationalist Uighur group in Kazakhstan in an interview in Almaty.
Local officials said the number of arrests was much lower, but refused to give further details.
""They have arrested several counter-revolutionaries and they are catching more,"" the woman resident said.
""The Uighurs are walking the streets and they look happy because the streets are full of them,"" she said in a sign of the depth of ethnic divisions. ""It's just them in the streets. It's all their people. No one else is on the streets.""
However, Han residents said they were not afraid.
""We are not nervous because the armed police and police are here,"" the woman said.
""If something happens we will...unite,"" another Han resident said. ""There are also patriots among the Uighurs.""
Officials tried to play down the riot, describing it as a small incident fuelled by ""foreign hostile forces"". They refused to say how many people were killed or wounded.
Yining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.
In Almaty, Yusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan, said the riot was sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs by the authorities last week.
However, an official of the bureau in charge of directing the clean-up operation after the riot denied that report.
""This is a pure fabrication,"" he said. ""But I cannot tell you the reason.""
The rioters attacked Han Chinese on sight, smashed cars and set fire to shops, forcing authorities to mobilise 1,000 police and paramilitary People's Armed Police to quell the violence, witnesses said. Police fired teargas to disperse the crowd.
The demonstrators, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, had marched on a government building, one official said.
The riot erupted after a Uighur criminal suspect resisted arrest by Chinese police, a Chinese source said.
Xinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.
Last May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.

BenjaminKangLim,"Chinese police have arrested the suspected ringleader of last week's riot in the mainly Moslem northwestern region of Xinjiang that left at least 10 people dead and 144 injured, local officials said on Wednesday.
Authorities had issued emergency circulars calling on local officials to deal a blow to separatism in the frontier region and warning of severe punishment for last week's rioters.
Government units had been ordered to form vigilante squads to guard against possible attacks by separatists in the town of Yining near China's border with Kazakhstan, officials said.
""We are resolved to deal a blow to the handful of ethnic separatist elements,"" said Zhang Youlian, deputy director of the foreign affairs office for the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, that administers Yining.
Police had arrested Abudu Heilili, 29, of the Uighur ethnic minority, and were interrogating him following the riot last Wednesday and Thursday, said a local Communist Party official.
The suspect was unemployed and a ringleader of a less violent anti-Chinese demonstration in Yining in August 1995, the official told Reuters by telephone.
Heilili had been released after that protest following ""ideological education"" -- political indoctrination, he said.
Police had already rounded up 200 to 300 people after last week's riot, in which at least 10 people were killed and 144 injured. Many suspects had been released after questioning, officials said.
The death toll could rise, with up to seven people listed as missing, the party official said. About 90 people were treated for head wounds, and more than 10 were still in hospital.
Of the injured, 132 were civilians while the remaining 12 were members of the paramilitary People's Armed Police, a spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government said.
About 1,000 people, mostly Uighur farmers or unemployed young men, rioted in Yining last week in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.
Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority in Xinjiang, where ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.
""We don't want the Communist Party,"" the demonstrators had chanted, witnesses said.
Uighur demonstrators had attacked Han Chinese with bricks, clubs and knives, and rampaged through the town, smashing and setting fire to about 20 vehicles and looting shops.

BenjaminKangLim,"China was caught on Thursday in a no-win situation in a row between its old communist comrade, Pyongyang, and a new commercial ally, Seoul, with a North Korean official holed up in the South Korean embassy in Beijing.
""Whatever way they (the Chinese) play it... it's impossible to keep both Koreas happy,"" one Western diplomat said.
South Korea said Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, and an assistant were seeking asylum at Seoul's embassy in Beijing.
North Korea accused the South of kidnapping Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of Pyongyang's ruling Workers' Party, and urged China to sort out the mess -- in North Korea's favour.
Diplomats said they saw little opportunity for Beijing to settle the row in its backyard without disappointing the Stalinist North, one of China's few remaining socialist allies.
""The inevitable outcome is that the guy will end up in Seoul. I can't see any way around it,"" a second diplomat said.
Diplomats said they expected some tough negotiations on the crisis, with Hwang possibly locked inside the South Korean compound for some time.
South Korea has sent Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha, to Beijing for talks on the defector's fate.
If South Korea can convince China that Hwang sought asylum of his own free will and was not kidnapped, China has little choice but to allow the defector to leave for South Korea, the diplomats said.
Already Beijing was giving a hint of its position.
Chinese police blocked the sedate, tree-lined avenues leading to South Korea's consular office in Beijing, where Hwang arrived by taxi on Wednesday to seek asylum.
The cordon was protection for the compound and its high-profile guest against possible North Korean intrusions rather than to prevent the apparent defector from leaving China, diplomats said.
""The Chinese will play it according to the rules,"" the second Western diplomat said. ""They won't stick their nose into the embassy itself. That's something they'll never do.
""It (the cordon) could be as much for the protection of the South Koreans as anything else because the North Koreans could do anything,"" he said. ""You'd want to make sure there are no untoward incidents.""
Hwang, 73, was the highest ranking Pyongyang official to seek asylum in South Korea. He was in charge of the North Korean communist party's foreign policy and a member of its powerful central committee, said Seoul officials, who rank him 24th in the Pyongyang power structure.
But Beijing must placate North Korea, whose friendship China once described as being as close as ""lips and teeth"".
""They'll have to find some face-saving way to resolve the problem,"" the second diplomat said.
""They (Chinese) turned a blind eye in the past to defections through China and that may become a lot more difficult from now on,"" he said.
China has called for calm in the interests of peace and stability in the Korean peninsula while it investigates.
North and South Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.
But capitalist South Korea has become an important trading partner and source of investment for China in recent years.
""There's far more in the relationship with South Korea for China than... with North Korea,"" the first diplomat said.
""China's primary interest in North Korea is that the country doesn't collapse with refugees flooding across the border and possible nuclear problems,"" he said.
North Korea was suspected in the early 1990s of pursuing a weapons-grade nuclear programme. Under an agreement signed with Washington in 1994 Pyongyang promised to dismantle the programme in return for safer light-water reactors.
"
BenjaminKangLim,"China and South Korea negotiated on Friday over the defection of a top North Korean who has taken refuge in Seoul's mission in Beijing while Pyongyang officials said they aimed to persuade the defector to return.
Talks in Singapore between South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen failed to break a deadlock over the defector, Hwang Jang-yop, 73, the most senior Pyongyang official to flee the North.
In Beijing, however, a South Korean embassy official said negotiations had begun over Hwang, who spent a second night in the embassy compound with an aide as Seoul and Pyongyang both made hectic efforts to claim him.
China has been dragged unwillingly into the row between an old communist comrade and a new business friend.
Diplomats have said China may find itself with little option but to give in to the wishes of the defector, thus angering one of its last remaining socialist allies.
Beijing tried to play for time.
""This incident happened all of a sudden, so we need more time to investigate,"" China's Qian told reporters after a 50-minute meeting with Seoul's Yoo in Singapore.
He urged both Koreas ""to treat this matter with a cool and calm manner, to keep peace and stability"".
Yoo said the two sides would meet again, but did not say where or when. He said Friday's talks were ""good"".
In the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, dozens of Chinese police cordoned Seoul's consular section off for a second day. Hwang arrived at its door on Wednesday to seek asylum.
""They (North Koreans) are harassing us and we are a little nervous about that,"" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, adding that Seoul had asked Beijing to maintain tight security around the compound.
Hwang, who could face summary execution or a lifetime in the gulag if he goes back to the North, was in good health and sleeping well, Chang said. He was spending the day reading.
A North Korean official standing outside the police cordon said Pyongyang had no plans to storm the compound to recover a countryman Pyongyang says was kidnapped.
""We are waiting here for him to come out and then ask him to come back,"" said the official who declined to identify himself.
A group of about 10 North Koreans, badges of the late North Korean leader Kim Il-sung pinned to their lapels, returned to wait in freezing temperatures outside the compound on Friday after police asked them to leave overnight.
""If China allows him to go to South Korea then we will be disappointed,"" said another North Korean. ""It will be regrettable.""
Some commentators have suggested Pyongyang might react violently to the defection of a man ranked 24 in its hierarchy, who is a senior aide to reclusive leader Kim Jong-il and North Korea's top communist party theoretician.
Pyongyang has charged that Hwang must have been kidnapped, and has called on Beijing to sort out the mess.
Seoul has dismissed as ""preposterous"" Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, was abducted.
It was not clear whether Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korea's Foreign Minister, was meeting Chinese officials.
Kim failed to hold talks with Chinese officials when he arrived on Thursday as Beijing, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided a meeting, South Korean sources said.
Officials at the North Korean embassy refused to comment or confirm reports from Seoul that Pyongyang had sent a delegation to China to discuss Hwang's defection.

BenjaminKangLim,"Chinese police have moved North Korean diplomats away from the area around the South Korean mission in Beijing where a top-level Pyongyang official has taken refuge, witnesses said on Friday.
However, there was no sign of movement in a diplomatic impasse over the fate of Hwang Jang-yop, 73, a pillar of North Korea's Stalinist establishment, and his assistant who have sought asylum in the South.
China, finding itself in a diplomatic quandary involving its old communist comrade and a new commercial friend, has avoided direct comment and chosen instead to appeal for calm.
In Singapore, South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen met to discuss a South Korean appeal for safe passage from Beijing to Seoul for the defector, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Qian said after the talks that Beijing needed more time.
""This incident happened all of a sudden, so we need more time to investigate,"" he told reporters.
In the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, dozens of Chinese police cordoned Seoul's consular section off for a second day. Hwang, the most senior official to defect from North Korea, arrived on Wednesday to seek asylum.
""They are harassing us and we are a little nervous about that,"" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, adding that Seoul had asked Beijing to maintain tight security around the compound.
Chinese police moved away several North Koreans watching the compound from cars parked in side streets overnight, witnesses said.
""I still don't believe it,"" said one North Korean who drove up to the cordon on Friday. ""Judging from this situation and his position it is not possible for him to defect.
""If China allows him to go to South Korea then we will be disappointed,"" said the North Korean, who declined to identify himself. ""It will be regrettable.""
Pyongyang has charged that Hwang, 73, one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, must have been kidnapped, and has called on Beijing to sort out the mess.
Seoul has dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, was kidnapped, saying he arrived at the compound in a taxi on Wednesday.
China's Foreign Ministry said it had nothing to say on Friday on the diplomatic tussle in its backyard.
It was not clear whether Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha, would meet Chinese officials on Friday.
Kim failed to hold talks with Chinese officials when he arrived from Seoul on Thursday as Beijing, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided a meeting, South Korean sources said.
However, he met the defector inside the compound.
Officials at the North Korean embassy refused to comment or confirm reports from Seoul that Pyongyang had sent a delegation led by an official at the level of vice-minister and including officials from the ruling Workers Party and the Foreign Ministry to discuss Hwang's defection.
South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.

BenjaminKangLim,"Most Chinese have been slow to forgive and forget Japanese atrocities in World War Two and fear a possible resurgence of militarism in the land of the rising sun, a survey published in Beijing on Saturday showed.
The survey, conducted by the official China Youth Daily last December, showed that 99.4 percent of 15,000 people interviewed nationwide thought young Chinese ""should remember"" Japan's 1931-45 occupation of China.
More than 97 percent of the respondents were aged below 40, too young to have been victims of Japan's war atrocities. By Beijing's count, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded by invading Japanese troops.
Asked what first came to their minds when Japan was mentioned, 81.3 percent of respondents said the Rape of Nanjing.
Japanese troops marched into Nanjing, China's pre-communist capital and known then as Nanking, in 1937 and engaged in an orgy of rape and massacre. Up to 250,000 Chinese were believed to have been killed.
More than 97 percent of respondents said they could not tolerate repeated attempts by Japanese officials to whitewash their wartime atrocities, including the Rape of Nanjing.
The China Youth Daily survey showed that 94.9 percent of the respondents were opposed to Japan becoming a United Nations Security Council member.
It also showed that 85.1 percent of respondents believed Japan wanted to become a military superpower and 70.7 percent saw Japan as a new threat to peace in Asia.
China itself ruffled feathers in the region last March when it intimidated rival Taiwan by conducting missile tests and war games close to the island in the run-up to Taiwan's historic presidential elections.
The sheer size of the People's Liberation Army -- the world's biggest at three million -- has caused uneasiness among China's neighbours.
China has been mired in a dispute with Japan over a group of islands in the East China Sea and another dispute with Asian neighbours over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
The survey showed that 53.8 percent of respondents thought that Japanese despised Chinese, while 50.8 percent said Japanese discriminated against Chinese.
Many Chinese themselves harbour deep suspicions and are hostile toward foreigners.
More than 56 percent of the respondents said the Japanese were ""cruel"", 45.2 percent said ""arrogant"" and 45.3 percent described them as ""war freaks"" by nature.
But 52.7 percent of the respondents said they owned Japanese-made electrical appliances.
Many respondents were suspicious of Japanese motives for investing in China. More than half said Japanese investment aimed to control China, while 45.3 percent said Japan dumped outdated equipment in China.
On Friday, the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, accused the United States and Japan of covering up the U.S. military's firing of uranium-tipped bullets near Okinawa during drills in December 1995 and January 1996.
The United States apologised this month.
The People's Daily said Washington's argument that the bullets were mislabelled was unconvincing and questioned why the incident was kept a secret for more than a year.

BenjaminKangLim,"For Moslems of the Uighur ethnic minority in northwest China, wearing neckties bearing a crescent and a star -- the national emblem of East Turkestan -- could land them in jail. But many young men are proudly defiant.
For Tibetan monks, nuns and civilians, displaying pictures of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, could mean imprisonment. But almost every Tibetan family in the deeply religious Himalayan region of China has one.
Uighurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minority groups tried to resist Chinese rule for decades, but uprisings were crushed and dissent silenced under the late chairman Mao Zedong's iron-fisted rule.
With Beijing loosening its grip slightly in recent years, more Uighurs and Tibetans have dared to speak their minds, and many clamour for independence in defiance of Beijing's attempts to dilute their culture.
An anti-Chinese riot in the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang -- a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan -- this month left nine people dead and 198 wounded, officials said. Police arrested up to 300 people after the riot.
""Minority ethnic groups are like wild horses that are difficult to tame,"" a government official in Beijing said.
""They could gallop away at any time...regardless of how well fed they are,"" said the official, speaking anonymously. ""Like a centrifugal force, their tendency is to move away.
""Ethnic minorities are an old problem, a big problem and a difficult problem to solve,"" the official added.
This month's Moslem riot was one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang -- which means New Frontier in Chinese -- since the communist takeover in 1949.
Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by bombings and assassination attempts.
Tibet has been rocked periodically by riots led by Buddhist monks and nuns loyal to the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against the Chinese.
China accuses the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, of fomenting unrest in Tibet.
Extremities committed during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang and Tibet have contributed to the resolve of ethnic minorities to try to bolt, analysts said.
Han Chinese, who account for more than 90 percent of China's population of 1.2 billion, have been accused of trying to dilute the cultures of Uighurs and Tibetans.
Uighurs were banned from learning their written language in the Cultural Revolution. ""It's like hacking them with a knife. They'll never forget the wound,"" the government official said.
Han Chinese have had more success assimilating other ethnic minorities. The proud Manchus ruled China from 1644 to 1911, but few Manchus can read or write their own language.
A natural divide in looks, lifestyle, language was to blame for much ethnic unrest in more far-flung regions, analysts said.
Uighurs, like their Central Asian cousins, speak Turkic, are Moslems and abstain from pork, a main staple for Han Chinese.
""There's a big difference in the lifestyle, food, language, customs, costume and culture of Han Chinese and Uighurs. These are natural barriers,"" the official said.
China blames ""hostile foreign forces"" for much of the ethnic unrest. Kazakhstan is home to many exiled Uighur separatists.
China also has repeatedly accused Western countries of supporting Tibet's Dalai Lama.
""But why are there no disturbances in Inner Mongolia?"" one analyst asked in reference to China's northern region, populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians. ""That is because Mongolia did not extend its arm into China.""
"
BenjaminKangLim,"Selling motorcycles used to be a joy ride for the giant, military-founded China Jialing Industrial Co Ltd, but then it ran into real market competition and growth slowed down sharply.
""Up until 1995, we sold as much as we produced,"" said Tian Min, deputy director of financial affairs at the Shanghai-listed firm, in which the Chinese government has a 75 percent stake.
But Jialing, China's biggest motorcycle manufacturer and a former munitions manufacturer that began making civilian products in 1979, saw rival manufacturers mushroom across China in 1994 and 1995 to cash in on its market.
Cutthroat competition slashed prices and profits and swelled stockpiles last year.
""In 1996, we could not sell what we produced,"" Tian said in an interview at Jialing's headquarters in China's wartime capital of Chongqing in southwestern Sichuan province.
Jialing's sales plunged to 3.5 billion yuan ($421.7 million) in 1996 from 4.6 billion yuan in 1995. After-tax profits tumbled to 270 million yuan in 1996 from 460 million yuan in 1995.
""Sales in 1994 and 1995 were good and many seeing this jumped aboard,"" Tian said.
China has about 300 motorcycle plants with total annual production capacity of 20 million units, but only 10 make more than 100,000 a year.
China is the world's largest motorcycle maker, churning out 7.83 million units in 1995, but selling only 6.1 million.
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has called for moves to curb blind investment in industries that appear profitable.
Blind investment is being repeated in many sectors, such as colour televisions, washing machines and refrigerators. Production has outstripped demand, leading to overheated competition, price wars and mounting losses among state firms.
Adding to the problems of motorcycle manufacturers, some regional governments, alarmed at traffic congestion and air pollution, have discouraged motorcycle purchases by curbing the issue of licence plates.
TIGHT MONETARY POLICY TO BLAME
Tian also blamed the company's woes on the government's tight monetary policy to rein in galloping inflation.
""The motorcycle market shrank...because people have less money...and less buying power,"" he said.
Tight monetary policy has also resulted in triangular debt, or debt owed among state-owned firms, and cash flow problems.
""Debts owed to each other are very serious...We can't get our money back for motorcycles sold,"" Tian said.
Jialing's collectibles soared to 700 million yuan in 1996.
The company has formed debt collection squads and aims to reduce collectibles to 300 million yuan by end-1997. Collectibles were virtually non-existent in 1994.
STRUGGLING TO REMAIN NUMBER ONE
The climb to the top is hard. Staying on top is even harder.
A price war has forced Jialing to slash prices by an average of 13 percent in 1997, Tian said. The price cut was expected to reduce sales by 400 million yuan a year.
Sales staff would receive commissions linked to performance instead of a fixed salary to try to increase sales, he said.
Jialing will curb waste and cut stockpiles, now 80,000-90,000. It is inviting tenders to force competition among parts suppliers and expects to save 300 million yuan in 1997.
Its motorcycle engines are produced at a joint venture plant with Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd.
Sales were forecast to hit 4.2 billion yuan in 1997, while profits would be ""no lower"" than in 1996, Tian said.
Jialing would produce 1.35 million motorcycles in 1997 from 1.13 million in 1996. It has capacity for 1.7 million.
Its 1995 output of 1.1085 million motorcycles accounted for 14 percent of the national total of 7.83 million. Jialing's output was forecast to hit two million in the year 2000.
AMBITIONS RISE BEYOND MOTORCYCLES
Jialing has ambitions to do more than produce motorcycles.
It has applied to issue H shares in Hong Kong to raise funds to expand into car production, financing and pharmaceuticals.
The company wants to set up a non-bank financial institution to finance motorcycle sales, Tian said.
To meet the challenges of China's fledgling market economy, Jialing, like many state enterprises, must tackle overstaffing and the burden of cradle-to-grave welfare for its employees.
Jialing plans to lay off about one percent of its 12,500 employees in 1997, with the accumulated figure hitting 3,000 in the year 2000, Tian said.
""We're not like capitalist countries...we can't just abandon them,"" Tian said. ""We have to help them to find new jobs...or it'll bring problems to our social order and stability.""

BenjaminKangLim,"North Korea said on Monday it would fire a top official marooned in South Koreas embassy in China if he sought asylum and Seoul went on alert for possible attack but said it wanted talks on the Cold War crisis.
Pyongyangs Foreign Ministry, commenting on the highest level defection yet from the Stalinist nation, saying that if leading ideologue Hwang Jang-yop had been kidnapped, then North Korea would take ""decisive countermeasures"".
""Our stand is simple and clear. If he was kidnapped, we cannot tolerate it and we will take decisive countermeasures,"" the KCNA news agency, monitored in Tokyo, quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying.
""If he sought asylum, it means that he is a renegade and he is dismissed,"" it said, adding that it had asked Beijing to investigate what it called the disappearance of Hwang, who took refuge in Seouls mission in Beijing six days ago.
North Koreas ambassador was believed to have met officials at Chinas Foreign Ministry on Monday.
Hwangs defection has embarrassed his hermit homeland, delighted Seoul and mired Beijing in a quandary over how to usher him out of China without offending an old communist comrade or a new capitalist friend.
But Hwang turned 74 on Monday with no sign of progress to celebrate in his appeal for asylum in the South, and still stranded in Seouls heavily guarded consulate in Beijing.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced U.S. concern over events on the Korean peninsula, saying they underlined the need for dialogue between rival North and South.
South Korea prepared for possible attacks by Pyongyang as the Cold War crisis escalated, but said confrontation over the defector would not scuttle its efforts for detente.
Another prominent defector, Li Il-nam, a nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jong-ils ex-wife, remained in a coma after being shot and critically wounded at the weekend by suspected North Korean agents near Seoul.
Security around South Koreas ports, airports and other public places had been beefed up and 10,000 police and soldiers searched for the two suspected agents who shot Li.
Seoul Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said problems stemming from Hwangs defection were just the start of headaches for Seoul because of a crisis in the North.
""I believe the North Korean regimes crisis will deepen as time passes because theres no likelihood of improvement in its economic hardship and food shortages, and signs of laxity in its social order,"" Yoo told a meeting of South Korean diplomats.
South Koreas security-related ministers on Sunday agreed that a desperate Pyongyang resort to guerrilla attacks after Hwang, a top adviser the Norths Kim Jong-il, sought asylum.
Dour warnings from North Korean officials in Beijing of the consequences of any attempt to move Hwang to the South gave a hint of Pyongyangs willingness to retaliate.
""If they make him go to Seoul, I think there will be war,"" said one North Korean official who declined to be identified.
South Korean diplomats and Chinese police guarding the mission brought in extra blankets and mattresses in a sign they expected a lengthy stand-off over Hwang.
However, dozens of North Korean officials disappeared on Monday afternoon from outside the building where they have kept a round-the-clock vigil since Hwang disappeared inside.
China, an unwilling third party in the feuding between the two hostile ends of the Korean peninsula, has appealed to both sides to act calmly to resolve the affair.
Analysts say the North has suffered huge loss of face over the defection of Hwang, who was ranked high in the hierarchy of his Stalinist homeland and was the architect of its governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance.
"
BenjaminKangLim,"Beijing's new mayor on Monday vowed the battle against corruption in the Chinese capital would go on but sought to put behind him a graft scandal that led to the downfall of the city's Communist Party boss.
Acting Mayor Jia Qinglin told the Beijing People's Congress, or city council, that a government crackdown on corruption had curbed wining and dining at public expense, the use of luxury cars by low-ranking officials and civil servants living in excessively large housing.
""The struggle against corruption has been crowned with new results,"" the mayor said. ""We must unceasingly score new victories in the struggle against corruption.""
Chinese Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has identified corruption as a virus that could topple the ruling party and some of China's most serious cases under communist rule have emerged in Beijing.
Officials would be required to declare their incomes and gifts received and the government would speed up supervision of the approval of major infrastructure projects, the appointment of key officials and the appropriation of funds, Jia said.
In his 100-minute speech to the opening session in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Jia made no mention of Chen Xitong, who was ousted as Beijing's Communist Party secretary in April, 1995.
The mayor wanted to bury the scandal, analysts said.
""Jia Qinglin is an outsider...and doesn't know how deep Beijing's political waters are,"" one analyst said.
Jia was party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian before being appointed as Beijing mayor last October.
The Beijing People's Congress was expected to formally elect Jia as mayor during its five-day session.
""If he can avoid the controversy, he will run away from it as far as possible,"" said the analyst, who asked not to be identified.
Other Beijing officials, including former mayor Li Qiyan, have previously mentioned Chen in their speeches, urging party cadres to draw a lesson from the scandal. Li has been removed and appointed a vice-minister of labour.
One academic said: ""Jia Qinglin is a newcomer. Issues like these are better left unsaid. It's no good if he talks too tough. It's also no good if it's not tough enough.""
Chen, 66, has been out of the public eye since stepping down as Beijing party boss after his protege, Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen, committed suicide after coming under investigation for corruption in April 1995.
Chen was sacked from the party's powerful Politburo in September 1995, the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the puritan communists swept to power in 1949.
Last December, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa, said Chen could be punished for dereliction of duty but not for any more serious offence.
Chen had accepted many expensive gifts, but more than a year of investigation into the man who presided over China's capital for most of the 1980s had uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing in exchange, Zhang said.
Chen was being held outside Beijing, pending completion of the investigation, he said.
One of Chen's sons, Chen Xiaotong, former general manager of a Sino-Japanese joint venture hotel in Beijing, has been detained. His wife was free, but his mistress was on the run, Zhang said.

BenjaminKangLim,"China is considering restrictions on foreign investment in textiles, garments and sectors where domestic production capacity is already excessive, a senior official of the State Statistical Bureau said on Tuesday.
""The production capacity of some of our traditional industries, such as textiles and garments, is pitifully excessive,"" Li Qiming, director of the bureau's department of industry and transportation statistics, told Reuters.
""We are currently considering...whether to restrict foreign businessmen from entering sectors in which domestic production capacity is already abundant,"" Li said. He did not elaborate.
The losses of state enterprises in these industries exceed the national average, Li said but gave no specific figures.
China has said it would curb textile output and unnecessary expansion in the industry in 1997 to reduce losses in the state sector. It has set a target of phasing out obsolete textile equipment, including 10 million cotton spindles.
""There were 429 state textile enterprises that posted losses of more than five million yuan ($602,000) each in 1995. Their combined losses reached 5.21 billion yuan.""
""Indigenous enterprises are being squeezed...in some traditional industries,"" Li told a news conference.
""We may have to consider protection,"" he said.
The bureau spent one year and mobilised five million pollsters to conduct a survey of industries that showed that foreign investment was concentrated mainly in electronics, telecommunications, textile, garment and food processing, officials said.
China's 10 eastern coastal provinces and provincial-level cities have attracted 87 percent of total foreign investment, while five provinces in northwest China took in less than one percent of foreign investment, Li said.
The survey showed 59,311 wholly foreign-owned and Sino-foreign joint ventures had set up in China by the end of 1995, up 29,343, or 97.9 percent compared with end-1994.
Their combined output value was 1.2 trillion yuan ($144.6 billion) at end-1995, the survey showed. They made profits totalling 79.2 billion and paid 39.8 billion yuan in taxes.
The number of foreign-funded enterprises accounted for 10 percent of the total number of enterprises in China, but the output of foreign firms accounted for 20 percent of the total.
Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen were the biggest investors, accounting for 32.6 percent of the total. It was inevitable that the government would impose restrictions on foreign investment in industries to protect the state sector, analysts said.
About 38 percent of state enterprises registered losses in 1996 compared with the previous year, Li said.
Losses posted by state firms soared 37.53 percent in 1996, he said.
Pre-tax profits of state enterprises slipped 4.83 percent in 1996 while after-tax profits plunged 42.5 percent.
Excessive stockpiles accounted for 20 percent of funds tied up by finished products.
Debts owed among enterprises worsened, with collectibles of state enterprises increasing by 11.8 percent in 1996.

BenjaminKangLim,"China's leadership has dissolved the once-powerful personal office of 92-year-old patriarch Deng Xiaoping in what could be a sign his health is increasingly fragile, a Chinese source and diplomats said on Wednesday.
Deng's health has stirred intense speculation this week, rocking stock markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan on Tuesday and prompting an attempt by Beijing to calm fears.
Japanese media reported that Deng had been admitted to hospital in critical condition, while a Hong Kong newspaper said he was recuperating at home from a brain haemorrhage but was not near death.
China's official media on Wednesday made no mention of Deng's health.
The Deng office of advisers and secretaries -- or ""Deng ban"" as it is known in Chinese -- was dissolved shortly before the Lunar New Year, which fell on February 7, a Chinese source with close ties to the Communist Party said.
""If true, it is a signal Deng's health had deteriorated... Deng can no longer sustain a very active role in the political sphere,"" said a Western diplomat who had heard about the disbanding of the office.
Chinese sources told Reuters on Monday that Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng cut short out-of-town trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit the ailing patriarch.
Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival, when he appeared frail and faltering.
The dissolution of the Deng office also signalled China's succession problem was virtually complete and that Jiang had further consolidated power.
""Jiang Zemin is eager to tell the world that he is now in charge... and he no longer needs to take directives from Deng's office,"" the Chinese source said.
The office used to issue directives to the current leadership, including Jiang, but was considered to have outlived its usefulness, the source said.
It had been headed by Deng's top aide, General Wang Ruilin, a member of the party's powerful Central Military Commission.
""Deng Xiaoping has been retired for many years... Deng's office has no direct function,"" the source said.
Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, retired from his last official position in 1990 and his only post now is honorary chairman of China's Bridge Association, a title that reflects his lifelong passion for the game.
Rumours about Deng's health surface periodically and often have a direct impact on China-related bourses, where Deng's demise is seen by some as a potentially destabilising factor.
Apparently trying to calm China's markets, newspapers splashed a report that economic tsar Zhu Rongji held a seminar on Deng's economic theories and reported Deng had sent his condolences for the funeral of a late defence minister.
The Japanese daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoting diplomatic sources in Beijing with close ties to senior military officials, said Deng was critically ill after a brain haemorrhage.
The Chinese leadership had told senior party and government officials not to leave the country unless obliged to do so for pressing diplomatic reasons, the newspaper said.
Japan's Kyodo news agency said Deng suffered a brain haemorrhage last Friday.
Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper said Deng was recuperating at home and ""was not about to die soon"".
On Tuesday, China played down fears that Deng's health was deteriorating, saying there had been ""no big change"". It declined to say if there had been a small change or what could count as a major change.
"
BenjaminKangLim,"Will the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping plunge the world's most populous country into chaos and division, or will heir apparent Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin take over the reins?
Diplomats and analysts said on Thursday they expected calm before any storm.
Will Deng's anointed successor, who also holds the jobs of state President and head of the armed forces, escape the fate of Chairman Mao Zedong's chosen heir -- a man who survived less than two years when he locked horns with Deng over power?
Will Jiang reverse his mentor's economic reforms and return to Mao Zedong's orthodox communism? Will a power struggle brew behind the scenes among those eager to succeed Deng as China's de facto emperor?
The world will be watching to see which way China's political winds blow -- and how the leadership copes with a plethora of problems from unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor, corruption and a one-party system.
""I don't think there will be an immediate power struggle,"" one Western diplomat said on Thursday. ""The immediate concern will be to present a face of calm, stability and normality.""
Deng died late on Wednesday of respiratory failure -- a complication from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection. He ws 93 by Chinese reckoning, which adds a year to one's age.
His pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.
""There hasn't been such a death in 20 years, of such a prominent figure,"" another diplomat said.
China would be obsessed with stability and security, but the country could ground to a halt for some time while the nation mourns and leaders jockey for position, analysts said.
""There's going to be a lot more emphasis on stability, more focus on internal security so it's going to be... a cautious leadership,"" Hong Kong-based Sinologist Tai Ming Cheung said.
""There may be a certain amount of policy paralysis, which has been there already, but beyond that I don't see any great changes,"" Cheung said. ""There is going to be a lull.""
One Chinese analyst, who asked not to be identified, said stability would be a facade.
""It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent,"" said the analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb.
Jiang, 70, appears to have consolidated his power base.
But his political rivals, including Qiao Shi, 72, chairman of the National People's Congress, or parliament, were expected to jostle for power in the run-up to a crucial party congress later this year, analysts said.
""I expect an increase in political jockeying,"" Cheung said.
""I think that Jiang is making all the running and he is in a fairly strong position, so he is the one -- barring any mistakes -- to take full advantage, but then the other people will be pushing just as hard,"" Cheung said.
Jiang's predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, 77, who was sacked in 1989 as general secretary of the party for showing sympathy to students demonstrating for democracy, is waiting in the wings to stage a political comeback.
Zhao has not been seen in public for more than six years and is believed to be living under house arrest in Beijing.
Most analysts say Jiang is in control, but some write him off as a transitional leader.
""He (Jiang) has been consolidating his power considerably over the last year,"" the first diplomat said. ""He is now less dependent on Deng Xiaoping.""
"
BernardHickey,"Australian Treasurer Peter Costello's construction of a road-block in front of National Australia Bank Ltd's takeover plans has paradoxically made the bank look more attractive, analysts said on Wednesday.
But they said Costello's announcement that he would not allow a big bank merger until parts of the sector became more competitive tarnished the takeover premium built into Westpac Banking Corp's share price in particular.  
Investors who had expected National Australia Bank (NAB) to be given the green light to go on the big bank merger warpath pushed NAB's share price 2.5 percent higher, happy for now it will not have to make a big share issue to finance a takeover.
""The price movement in NAB is a reflection in the short term that the market sees it as a positive NAB won't be an acquirer because of the potential dilution of a share issue to fund such a takeover,"" said one senior Sydney bank analyst.
""NAB was underpriced and to the extent that a big rights isuse was hanging over the market, it makes sense for it to kick up a bit,"" said Macquarie Equities analyst Graham Maloney.  
NAB closed up 39 cents at A$16.11 after Treasurer Costello ended the ""Six Pillars"" policy banning mergers between the four major banks and two major life groups, but said the four majors would have to wait for stronger competition before merging.
Westpac Banking Corp, seen as the most vulnerable to takeover, closed down 20 cents at A$6.67, while ANZ Banking Group Ltd closed down 11 cents at A$7.89.
""There was a margin of acquisition premium there, particularly in Westpac. Now that it appears that there's unlikely to be an acquisition, it makes sense to mark it back,"" Maloney said.  
Analysts said however that Costello's comments about ending the current blanket ban on foreign takeovers of the major banks could offset some of the sector's disappointment.
""The equity markets are a little bit disappointed that the 'four pillars' effectively remain, but at the end of the day there is a potential for foreign takeover,"" said J.B. Were, head or research at Craig Drummond, adding that Westpac and ANZ were not expensive banks by global standards.
""The only risk is that there are major foreign holders that bought into both of those banks in the expectation that there could be a major bank merger,"" Drummond said.  
""Some traders could still cause Westpac and ANZ to be weak in the short term.""
Brokers said NAB's share price appeared also to benefit from the potential for a takeover bid by a foreign group.
""(The Wallis report) hasn't ruled out the possibility of allowing a foreign bank to take over any of our banks -- it seems to strengthen NAB's position and also the Commonwealth's (Bank of Australia ) position,"" said Kevin Lourey, a dealer at Melbourne broker, Peake Lands Kirwan.
CBA's shares rose 28 cents to A$12.98.  
Longer term, analysts said the Wallis Inquiry's recommendations on freeing up access to the banking sector and allowing non-banks access to the payments system would sharpen competition and eventually put profit margins under pressure.
""Opening access to the payments system, I see that as critical,"" said Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson.
""The capacity of someone like a GE Capital to have access to the payments system is a fairly important increase in competition,"" he said.

BernardHickey,"HSBC Holdings Plc, Citicorp and Standard Chartered Plc are seen as the hungriest of the predators eyeing Australia's major banks now a ban on takeovers by foreigners has been lifted, analysts said on Thursday.
Treasurer Peter Costello announced on Wednesday the end of a former Labor government's blanket-ban on takeovers of Australia's four largest banks by foreigners.  
The weakest of the four majors, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Westpac Banking Corp, are considered the juiciest prey for the foreign banks.
""HSBC is regarded is as perhaps the number one predator,"" said ABN AMRO banking analyst Mike Pulman.
""After that Lloyds TSB or ABN AMRO or Citicorp or Deutche Bank are the most likely,"" Pulman said.
However analysts said HSBC was unlikely to be closely eyeing ANZ because of ANZ's strong presence in Asia through its Grindlays unit, which would simply create duplication.  
National Australia Bank Ltd, the strongest of the big four, is seen as the least likely of the takeover targets because of its hefty overseas assets and its sheer size.
""They (NAB) don't provide purely an Australian exposure and they carry some foreign assets which might not be attractive to a bidder, particularly if you're already in that market,"" said Shaw Stockbroking banking analyst Anusha Srinivasan.
NAB owns Britain's Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank, the National Irish Bank and Michigan National Corp.  
""ANZ carries with it the same sort of caveat, do you want exposure to this Asian distribution they've got?"" Srinivasan said.
""ANZ argues it would be the least attractive to HSBC because of its Asian operations and the duplication aspect,"" Pulman said.
However, other analysts said ANZ's Asian connection may prove an attraction rather than a deterrent to those European and U.S. banks that don't have an Asian presence.  
Westpac, which does not have the same overseas assets, is therefore seen as the most likely of the weaker two banks to be taken over by a foreign bank. It is also seen most willing.
""Westpac is possibly the most likely, more because of the attitude of Westpac management which might be the most receptive to a bid,"" Pulman said.
Westpac's chief executive Bob Joss is an American seen more focused on maximising value for shareholders than keeping the bank Australian-owned.  
Standard Chartered Plc is seen first in line for Westpac, having already formed an alliance with Westpac to provide banking services to Westpac customers in Asia.
The recently privatised Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the final member of the big four, is the dark horse in the race, analysts said.
CBA is heavily exposed to the ultra-competitive home loan market, making it attractive to some who want a strong home loan book, but tarnishing it for others more interested in higher margin activities.  
But any budding foreign acquirer will have to move fast because the first takeover of a four major banks may well be the last to get through before the doors are slammed shut again, the analysts said.
Costello's announcement on the end to the foreign takeover ban went with the caveat that any large scale transfer of bank ownership to foreigners would not be allowed.
Costello did not say how many bank takeovers would be too many, but the official Wallis Financial Inquiry has said any more than one takeover would be a problem.  
""If that is correct, whoever makes their move from offshore is going to have to do it pretty smartly,"" Srinivasan said.
""If a takeover bid for one of the majors by a foreign bank is successful, then consequent bids might not be,"" she said.
"
BernardHickey,"If there was any doubt that Prime Minister John Howard's government is obsessed with keeping the ""battlers"" happy, then Treasurer Peter Costello wiped those out on Wednesday.
Costello could have simply given up his veto on big bank mergers, passing on any bank merger judgement to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) if, as he said, his primary concern was to make the banks more competitive.
The Wallis Inquiry, which Costello set up, recommended he do just that.
Instead he kept the veto and made up his own mind about how competitive the banks are now by telling the big four they could not merge until they become more competitive.
It's the ACCC's job to judge if a merger reduces competition and Costello is happy to let them pass jugdement in every other sector of the economy, so why not let ACCC Chairman Allan Fels decide on the banks?
The answer became clear when Costello was asked just this question in his news conference on Wednesday. Here's his reply.
""We are a government. We are elected. We are going to account to the Australian people and we have reserved to ourselves, at this stage, the decision that there will not be mergers between the four majors, and we have reserved to ourselves the decision to ensure that the Australian financial system still has healthy Australian ownership.
""We consider that a matter of public policy.""
Costello's motivation becomes even clearer when you look at his reasoning for keeping a 'four pillars' policy.
""We do not have a competitive enough access for small business to financial services,"" he said.
""One of the things that we would be interested in seeing is new entrants, non-bank institutions, starting to develop widely used financial lending practices, in relation to small business.""
For small business, read 'battlers'.
The same battlers John Howard has pledged to serve again and again since his election on March 3 last year.
Howard knows the battlers at least dislike the large banks and that they fear what the banks might do to bank fees and charges if they were allowed to get even more powerful.
Even the banks' own consumer surveys show they are very unpopular.
The last thing Howard wants is the ACCC telling him a bank merger is all right and being forced to swallow it.
The battlers, and therefore Howard, know better.
The prognosis for a change of heart is not good.
If the government cannot ignore the politics of bank mergers when it has a massive majority in the lower house, is two years out from the next scheduled election, and is in its first term of government, then when will it?
Some bank analysts expect a change of heart after the inevitable election win in 1999.
Don't bet on it while Costello and Howard are bowing to the battlers.

BernardHickey,"Australia's largest home mortgage lender warned on Wednesday that a proposed change to Australia's system of prudential regulation could lead to huge collapses like those seen in the U.S. savings and loan system.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia Managing Director David Murray said proposals by a government-sponsored inquiry into the financial system to regulate banks, pension funds, insurers and other non-banks within the same prudential system was too risky.
Murray told an audience of bankers and economists the proposal would create a system similar to that which regulated the U.S. savings and loan sector before widespread collapses in the 1980s.
""These proposals do take us into uncharted waters which set up for Australia a savings and loans system that cost the citizens of the United States an awful lot of money,"" he said.
Murray's criticism of the plan to open up the banking payments system to greater competition and strip the Reserve Bank of Australia of its prudential supervision role is the first major attack on the official Wallis' report on the financial system since its release last week.
The conservative Liberal/National government, which set up the Wallis Inquiry soon after its election last year, is currently considering Wallis' recommendations and is expected to make its recommendations later this year.
Murray's broadside was immediately attacked by one of his audience at a Committee for Economic Development (CEDA) luncheon as emotive scare-mongering.
Replying to a question from the floor, Murray said he would not back away from his comments, adding a bank or fund failure was too was too dangerous to risk changing the current system.
He said the time was right to debate Wallis' plan and others should not shy away from being critical.
At the moment, the Reserve Bank requires banks and others with banking licences to meet strict prudential requirements on capital reserves and stops non-banks from issuing cheques or allowing them access to the overnight payments system.
The inquiry, headed by businessman Stan Wallis, recommended that non-banks such as pension funds, building societies and even telecommunications groups be allowed access to the payments system and be covered by a single new body called the Australian Prudential Regulation Commission.
""I would prefer that the Reserve Bank remain the prudential supervisor,"" Murray said.
Later, Murray rejected the claim that he was scaremongering.
""More Australians have chosen to bank with us than any other financial institution. We're probably better aware of what is scaremongering and what is proper community debate than anybody else,"" he told reporters after his luncheon address.
Commonwealth Bank which was government-owned until last year, has the largest number of retail savings and other accounts of all of Australia's banks.
""It's a matter of fact that the S&amp;L system in America cost their community A$110 billion (US$86 billion),"" he said.
""Why should I therefore condone a supervisory system that appears to be built that way,"" he said.
""(Wallis) has deliberately overlaid a number of deposit-taking institutions into one supervisory system. That's what the American system did and they got the S&amp;L problem.
""I see that potential here and I hope that it doesn't happen,"" he said.
"
BernardHickey,"New Zealand-based investment group Brierley Investments Ltd on Tuesday called on the Australian government to relax its investment rules so that New Zealand companies are treated the same as Australian ones.
Brierley chairman Bob Matthew said Australia should change its rules to let New Zealand investment into Australia in the same way that trade between the trans-Tasman neighbours is now unhindered under the Closer Economic Relations agreement.  
""Certainly in the context of Australasia, there seems to be no merit whatsover in having one market for trade purposes and two distinct markets for investment,"" Matthew told Reuters in an interview.
""Australian business has had the benefit of entirely free investment environment in New Zealand and it's not possible to conceive an effective single market for trade when there's inhibitions as to where one can exploit capital,"" he said.
Brierley Investments has in the last two to three years made major investments in Australian groups.  
It has bought 28 percent of building materials group James Hardie Industries Ltd, 7.4 percent of retailer Coles Myer Ltd and 19.9 percent of publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
But this investment push, which sees the New Zealand-based Brierley now with A$1.8 billion invested in Australia and A$1.6 billion in New Zealand, has stalled this year as it came up against various rules restricting its investments.
Brierley was stopped from buying more of Fairfax by rules which force anyone holding more than 19.9 percent to make a full takeover bid or slowly increase their bid.  
Brierley would in any event be stopped from raising its stake any higher than 25 percent because of rules controlling foreign ownership in the media.
Foreigners are also stopped from buying more than 25 percent of telecommunications groups, which effectively stops Telecom Corp of New Zealand from taking a major role in Australia.
But Matthew said he was not overly hopeful the Australian government would kick its dependency on the ""regulation habit"", particularly when it had an uncooperative Senate.  
""I recognise that slender majorities tend to dampen achievement levels,"" he said.
Matthew said Australia should also drop its takeover rules and adopt those used in New Zealand which do not place the same restrictions on companies holding stakes over 19.9 percent.
Matthew, who is also Air New Zealand Ltd chairman, said he was optimistic that Australia would look at granting the airline further ""beyond rights"".
These rights allow Air New Zealand to stop over in Australia, pick up Australian customers and fly them to a third destination other than New Zealand.  
Australia's refusal to grant Air New Zealand further ""beyond rights"" has been a festering sore in diplomatic and business relations in the last two years.
Matthew said he expected the respective aviation ministers to meet again in May to discuss the issue.
""We consider it well and truly overdue,"" he said of the granting of the further rights.
Matthew also repeated comments by Brierley executive director Rod Price that Brierley had not spoken to Australian media mogul Kerry Packer about selling Brierley's Fairfax stake to Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd.  
""No. We aspire to be a long term and increasing shareholder in the Fairfax group,"" he said.
Packer has said he wants to increase his 11.8 percent stake if the government relaxes rules currently stopping television station owners from owning major newspapers at the same time.
The government is expected to ease these rules set up by the previous Labor government.
Brierley's shares closed unchanged at NZ$1.26 on Tuesday.

BernardHickey,"The Australian government ordered a Canadian television group to reduce its stake in an Australian television network on Friday, reflecting a strengthening in Canberra's opposition to more foreign ownership of local media.
Treasurer Peter Costello ruled that Canwest Global Communications Corp, controlled by Canadian Izzy Asper, must cut its stake in the Ten television network back to its previous 57.5 percent level from its current 76 percent.
Canwest raised its stake earlier this year through associated local companies, but a government authority said the increased ownership broke foreign control rules.
Costello's ruling came as Prime Minister John Howard, in his clearest statement yet, said he did not want foreign investment in the Australian media to go any higher.
""In the media for example, which is in the news at the moment, we've made it clear we don't want foreign investment to go any higher,"" Howard said in a radio interview after meetings with major media owners in recent weeks.
The government is reviewing cross-media ownership rules set by the former Labor government which stop television station proprietors from owning a major newspaper in the same city or vice versa.
The government is expected to drop these cross-media ownership rules, allowing local television and magazine mogul Kerry Packer to launch a takeover bid for newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
Howard also said a proposal by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd to increase its Australian television holdings had collapsed because Murdoch would not give up some of his newspapers to leave his total media holdings unchanged.
But Howard's determination to block foreign investors like Izzy Asper has unleashed a fierce debate about whether he was favouring Packer in his review of media laws.
Another of Australia's major media owners, Seven Network Ltd chairman Kerry Stokes, accused Howard of having done a ""disgraceful"" deal to deliver Fairfax to Packer.
Some commentators have said Packer's support for Howard ahead of last year's election has been a factor in Howard's opposition to the cross-media rules, which he says are outdated.
""For the Prime Minister to play king-maker revisits the darkest days of the Labor Party's deal-making with its mates,"" Stokes told Reuters.
Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke was seen as close to Packer during the 1980s, before his successor Paul Keating fell out with Packer ahead of his 1996 election rout.
""He (Howard) has made a commitment...done a deal with Packer. There's no other reason for the change,"" Stokes said, commenting on an Australian Financial Review article which said Howard planned to arrange for Murdoch to support a Packer takeover of Fairfax.
A clearly stung Howard rejected Stokes' claim.
""I reject completely any suggestion of a deal as a silly, erroneous and quite dishonourable claim,"" Howard told a news conference in Sydney.
""I'm on the record over a period of 10 years as being opposed to the cross-media restrictions,"" Howard said, pointing out his views preceded Packer's support for him in 1996.
"
BernardHickey,"Seven Network Ltd chairman Kerry Stokes attacked Prime Minister John Howard on Friday, accusing him of having done a ""disgraceful"" deal to deliver newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd to billionaire Kerry Packer.
Stokes told Reuters in an interview Howard had no right to negotiate any deal on Seven's ownership as part of a larger plan to ensure a Packer takeover of Fairfax.
""Who the hell does the Prime Minister think he's representing?"", Stokes said.  
""For the Prime Minister to play king-maker revisits the darkest days of the Labor Party's deal-making with its mates,"" he said.
Earlier on Friday the Australian Financial Review newspaper reported Howard had offered to do a deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd whereby News would be allowed to raise its stake in the Seven Network if News supported an easing of cross-media rules to allow a Packer takeover of Fairfax.
The Financial Review said Howard's plan fell through last week when News rejected one part of it which would have seen News sell some of its Australian newspapers to a new owner.  
Stokes said the reported deal showed Howard had done a deal with Packer.
""He has made a commitment ... done a deal with Packer. There's no other reason for the change,"" Stokes said.
""It's obviously to deliver Fairfax to Packer,"" he said.
""It shows a disgraceful disregard for the public interest.""
Stokes said such a deal meant the public would be robbed of an opportunity to have a say on media policy in Australia.
Stokes' Australian Capital Equities currently owns 26 percent of Seven while News owns about 14 percent.  
News, which is classified as a foreign shareholder because of Murdoch's U.S. citizenship, cannot own more than 15 percent of Seven under current foreign ownership rules.
Howard would have to grant an exemption.
The conservative Liberal-National government is currently reviewing the cross-media rules set up by the former Labor government prevent television station owners from owning a major newspaper in the same city or vice versa.
These rules stop Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd increasing its 12 percent Fairfax stake beyond 15 percent while it owns the top-rating Nine television network.  
The government is widely expected to drop the cross-media rules, allowing Packer to launch a takeover bid for Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian Financial Review and The Age newspapers.
Some commentators have said the government's decision to drop the cross-media rules had come after Packer endorsed Howard in a television interview before the 1996 election campaign.
The Financial Review report earlier on Friday said Howard had attempted to arrange the deal so as to mute mounting criticism about a lack of media diversity should Packer take over Fairfax.  
Packer was forced to withdraw from a consortium bidding for Fairfax in the the early 1990s after a public outcry led by former Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser.
Prime Minister Howard was not available to respond to Stokes specific comments, but his office said earlier comments made by Howard rejecting accusations of such a deal still stood.
Howard said late on Thursday he had opposed the cross-media rules for a long time and his views had nothing to do with Packer's support for him in the election campaign.

BernardHickey,"Local billionaire Kerry Packer faces an uphill battle to overcome political opposition and a high asking price if he wants to take over Australia's oldest publisher, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
Speculation has simmered for months that Australia's biggest television station owner will launch a takeover bid for Fairfax as soon as the government eased cross-media rules set up by the former Labor government.
Comments by Prime Minister John Howard last week that Fairfax needed an owner like Packer fanned that speculation into talk of an imminent easing of the rules and an inevitably successful takeover bid.
Analysts said on Tuesday however that a successful Packer bid for Fairfax, which publishes three of Australia's most profitable daily newspapers, was not such a sure thing.
Growing political opposition from within Howard's conservative Liberal-National coalition and a hostile Senate have made any Howard plan look more fragile.
""There's a few more hurdles to overcome yet,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett senior media analyst Vince Pepe.
""Getting (Prime Minister John) Howard to introduce legislation is one thing, but getting it through parliament while keeping his backbench appeased is another thing,"" Pepe said.
""The amount of political fallout that's beginning might see him wondering whether it is such a clever thing after all.""
Howard's cabinet was considering on Tuesday changes to the cross-media rules that stop television station owners like Packer from buying a major newspaper group like Fairfax.
Howard has already said the rules are outdated and his government is widely expected to drop them, allowing Packer to use his current 15 percent stake as a beachhead for a full scrip-based takeover bid.
But Howard's position has come under increasing fire in recent days after Seven Network Ltd Chairman Kerry Stokes accused Howard of having done what he called a disgraceful deal with Packer that would concetrate media ownership into the hands of just two men.
A successful Packer takeover of Fairfax would mean Australia's major newspapers would be divided between Packer and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.
A controversial independent senator, Mal Colston, threw up another roadblock in front of any media law changes earlier on Tuesday, threatening to vote against the government.
The fine balance in the Senate means if Colston votes against the government, the balance of power transfers to the left-leaning Democrat and Green senators, who have said they oppose any further concentration of media ownership.
Analysts also said Packer may baulk at having to pay the A$3.0 billion (US$2.35 billion) needed to convince some large entrenched shareholders to bail out Fairfax.
Packer may also struggle to convince his fellow shareholders in the bid vehicle, Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, to swallow the earnings dilution such a bid would create.
""Despite Packer's apparent obsession for Fairfax, he's not going to pay a stupid price for it and some people in the market are expecting a stupid price,"" said another analyst.
""I'd be a pretty disappointed PBL shareholder if he was prepared to pay more than A$3.40 (a share) for it,"" the analyst said, adding that a A$3.40 price would be earnings dilutive given Fairfax's forecast earnings. Fairfax's shares closed down two cents at A$3.23 on Tuesday.
(A$ = US$0.78)
"
BernardHickey,"A successful bid by local billionaire Kerry Packer for publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd is not the sure thing many market players and media commentators believe, analysts said on Tuesday.
Before Packer can launch a bid for Fairfax, the government would have to first decide to drop the current cross-media rules and then pass any legislation through a hostile senate.  
Packer would then have to offer a takeover premium on top of an already high Fairfax share price that was both tempting to existing shareholders and not too dilutive for Packer's fellow Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd shareholders.
""There's a few more hurdles to overcome yet,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett senior media analyst Vince Pepe.
""Getting (Prime Minister John) Howard to introduce legislation is one thing, but getting it through parliament while keeping his backbench appeased is another thing,"" Pepe said.  
""The amount of political fallout that's beginning might see him wondering whether it is such a clever thing after all,"" he said.

But Howard's position has come under increasing fire in recent days after Seven Network Ltd Chairman Kerry Stokes accused Howard of having done what he called a disgraceful deal with Packer and of playing king-maker.
Former conservative Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser wrote to Howard on Monday, calling on him not to lessen media diversity and Fairfax journalists went on strike on Tuesday morning to protest any government move to drop cross-media rules.
A successful Packer takeover of Fairfax would mean Australia's major newspapers would be divided between Packer and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.  
Government back-benchers have also written to Howard expressing their concern about the way changes are being considered.
Controversial independent senator Mal Colston threw up another roadblock in front of any media law changes earlier on Tuesday, threatening to vote against the government.
The fine balance in the senate means if Colston votes against the government, the balance of power transfers to the left-leaning Democrat and Green senators, who have said they oppose any further concentration of media ownership.  
""All the arrows are pointing in the right direction (for a takeover), but I wouldn't say it's a fait accompli,"" said a senior media analyst.
""It's (cross-media reform) got to get through the senate and the price has got to be reasonable,"" the analyst said.
Packer and PBL, which would be the vehicle for the scrip-based bid that Packer foreshadowed last year, would have to pay the equivalent of at least A$3.50 for each Fairfax share, analysts said. Fairfax's shares were unchanged at A$3.25 at 1.30 p.m. (0330 GMT).  
That price may prove too painful for Packer and his fellow shareholders, who would be concerned about earnings dilution and would have to approve any deal, analysts said.
""Despite Packer's apparent obsession for Fairfax, he's not going to pay a stupid price for it and some people in the market are expecting a stupid price,"" said a Sydney media analyst.
""I'd be a pretty disappointed PBL shareholder if he was prepared to pay more than A$3.40 for it,"" the analyst said, adding that a A$3.40 price would be earnings dilutive given Fairfax's forecast earnings.
""At A$3.50 to A$3.60 it becomes pretty savagely dilutive.""  
Analysts said the final roadblock to a successful Packer bid would be dislodging major Fairfax shareholders Brierley Investments Ltd, with about 20 percent, and Bankers Trust Australia with about 13 percent.
Brierley in particular has said often and loudly that it is a long term shareholder with ambitions of its own to take a higher stake and has in recent years held onto its investments for long periods. Packer may also have competition.  
The Australian newspaper reported earlier on Tuesday that British publisher Pearson Plc was part of consortium called Australian Independent Newspapers (AIN) that was considering bidding for all or part of Fairfax.

BernardHickey,"Australia's Westpac Banking Corp, struggling like its fellow major banks to cope with a savage interest margin squeeze, surprised analysts on Wednesday by posting a strong profit rise in the first half year.
Higher income from bank account and transaction fees and a series of property sale profits more than offset the squeeze on home lending margins, boosting net profit for the six months to March 31 by 12.9 percent to A$638 million (US$496 million).
Westpac increased its interim dividend to 19 cents from 16 cents after earnings per share (EPS) rose to 34.4 cents from 29.2 cents. The EPS rise was helped by a share buy-back.
Analysts had expected a profit of about A$610 million after Westpac warned late last year about the margin squeeze and foreshadowed flat profits.
The market however had in recent weeks has taken a more optimistic view of the likely profit result than the analysts, boosting Westpac's share price 16 percent in the last month.
""That's why the stock hasn't bounced as much as you'd expect it to,"" Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.
Westpac's shares closed down five cents at A$7.45 after a rise straight after the result to A$7.60.
Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss welcomed the profit rise as a solid result, but said it would be difficult to repeat the 12.9 percent rise in the second half because of what he said was a tremendous squeeze on lending margins.
""I think that it will be very hard to do in the second half given the margin pressures that we're seeing through all parts of our product range,"" Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss told a news conference.
Joss said however he expected the full year profit for the year to September 30 would be higher than the A$1.132 billion posted in 1995/96.
Australia's major banks have been forced in the last year to cut about 150 basis points off their home lending margins by red hot competition from non-banks that are funded by mortgage origination. These mortgage originators have snared about 10 to 12 percent of the Australian market in the last three years.
Westpac's group net interest margin fell to 3.55 percent in the six months to March 31 from 3.75 percent in the six months to September, which cost Westpac about A$88 million in the half.
Westpac's increases in bank fees and charges had not fully offset the effect of this margin squeeze, Joss said. Westpac's accounts showed Westpac's account keeping and transaction fee income rose to A$379 million from A$306 million a year earlier.
""There's constant pressure on margins so there's a test to do the best we can on fees, on lowering costs and increasing efficiencies,"" Joss said.
(A$ = US$0.7775)
"
BernardHickey,"A 22 percent rise in fee and other non-interest income boosted Westpac Banking Corp Ltd to a surprisingly strong first half profit result on Wednesday, more than offsetting the effect of a squeeze on interest margins.
Westpac announced a net profit of A$638 million for the six months to March 31, up from A$565 million in the same period a year earlier.  
Analysts said this was about A$20 million to A$30 million above their expectations, but had not shocked those in the market who had pushed Westpac's share price higher in recent weeks in anticipation of very strong result.
""That's why the stock hasn't bounced as much as you'd expect it to,"" Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.
Westpac's shares were down five cents at A$7.45 at 3.40 p.m. (0540 GMT), having earlier jumped to a A$7.60 high.  
The profit jump was due largely to non-interest income rising to A$869 million from A$714 million, underpinned by rising account fees and some profits from the sale of property and closed branches.
The boost from fees more than offset sluggish growth in interest income as Westpac, like Australia's other major banks, battled a 150 basis point squeeze in home lending margins.
Westpac's group net interest margin fell to 3.55 percent in the six months to March 31 from 3.75 percent in the six months to September.  
Non-bank competitors funded by mortgage origination have snared more than 10 percent of the home mortgage market in the past three years, forcing banks to cut their home loan margins by about 150 basis points to about 100 to 150 basis points.
""Features of the first half financial results were non-interest expense control, continued improvement in asset quality, improved staff productivity, and higher non-interest income reflecting: growth in commissions and fees, higher financial markets income and benefits from the sale of equity investments,"" Westpac managing director Bob Joss said in a statement.  
""These results were achieved against a background of reduced interest margins and continued investments in strategic capabilities designed to enhance future prospects,"" Joss said.
Westpac's net interest income fell to A$1.695 billion in the six months ended March 31 from A$1.705 billion in the six months to September 30 last year, but was up on the A$1.549 billion in the year-ago period.
Income from fees and commissions rose to A$592 million from A$532 million in the year-ago first half.
Other income, which included the sale of equity investments, rose to A$142 million from A$68 million a year earlier.  
Westpac also announced it planned to raise up to A$500 million through a preference share issue after its merger with Bank of Melbourne Ltd.
Westpac said it would issue up to 20 million non-cumulative converting preference share at an issue price of A$25 each. The money raised would be used to fund the cash component under the Bank of Melbourne merger scheme, it said.

BernardHickey,"Australia's anti-monopolies watchdog, examining claims of collusion against the four major banks, has asked them to explain why they all cut their mortgage rates by the same amount within hours of each other.
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Allan Fels said it was unusual that the banks would all move so quickly to cut their rates by the same amount.
""We don't claim to have evidence of collusion. What we are doing is seeking an explanation from the banks,"" Fels said in a radio interview broadcast on Monday.
National Australia Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp all cut their standard variable mortgage rates by 0.35 percent to 7.2 percent on Friday, hours after the Reserve Bank cut official rates by 0.5 percent to 5.5 percent.
Government and opposition politicians and consumer groups have since suggested the banks colluded to ensure they did not pass all of the official rate cut on to their customers.
Fels said the commission would ask for details of any communications between the banks on Friday and whether there had been any previous discussion about their approach to possible official rate cuts.
""The reason why we're seeking an explanation from the banks is that it is unusual for them all to have moved so quickly within a few hours of one and other and to have reduced their rates by the same limited amount of 0.35 (points) as against a Reserve Bank reduction of 0.5,"" Fels said.
""Occasionally, one player will do something a bit different,"" Fels said.
""But in this case the four big players, all of them, moved by exactly the same amount, despite having told so many of us over time that their circumstances, their costs and their strategies all differ.""
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the first big bank to cut mortgage rates after Friday's official rate cut, denied on Monday that it had colluded with the other major banks.
""I haven't discussed interest rates with the other banks,"" CBA Managing Director David Murray said.
""We have a very careful discipline within the bank, because we don't believe in collusion, we believe in competition,"" Murray said, adding he would cooperate fully with the ACCC.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Friday questioned the level of competition amoung the banks.
""It is pretty hard to believe we have a highly competitive banking system at the present time when there can be delays of the kind that we are apparently about to witness in the passing on in the reduction in official interest rates,"" Howard said.
Opposition politicians also criticised the banks, who have also come under heavy public fire this year for increasing bank fees to offset a squeeze on home lending margins.
Opposition Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said it was hard to believe the banks were not colluding on rates. ""It's a little like a line of chorus girls, all with impeccable timing raising their leg exactly so high,"" Evans told reporters.

BernardHickey,"Australia's largest banks, under increasing political pressure to pass on all of an official interest rate cut to their customers, hit back on Wednesday at government comments they described as ""bank-bashing.""
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) chief executive Don Mercer said government criticism of the major banks in general was unfair and irresponsible.
""I'm very, very disappointed with this bank-bashing,"" Mercer told a news conference where he had just announced an 18-percent rise in ANZ's first-half net profits.
""I'm tired of it,"" he said.
Mercer said the Australia's major banks had cut variable mortgage rates by 330 basis points since the middle of last year while official rates had been cut by only 200 basis points.
""We have passed on more than the reductions in the cash rate,"" Mercer said. ""It really isn't fair.""
Mercer said banks had become easy targets for politicians wanting to earn easy political support.
""We're a free kick. Any time a politician wants a free kick, they just bash the banks. You can't lose,"" Mercer said.
The four major banks cut their variable mortgage rates by 35 basis points on Friday after the Reserve Bank's 50 basis point cut in official interest rates, sparking a round of criticism from government and consumer groups who claimed the banks had taken the opportunity to bolster their profits.
Australia's anti-monopoly watchdog is investigating allegations of collusion between the big four.
Treasurer Peter Costello, Prime Minister John Howard and various opposition politicians have attacked most of the banks' decision not to pass on all of the latest cut.
Costello again on Wednesday accused the major banks of profiting at the expense of consumers.
""The rate cuts were for consumers. That cut (on Friday) was not done for the benefit of the banks,"" Costello said in a radio interview on Wednesday.
""It wasn't done so that the banks could do a bit of price taking along the way,"" he said.
Costello went on to recommend consumers shift to those smaller banks and non-banks which had passed on all of the cut.
Ironically, Mercer's comments came after Costello praised ANZ's decision on Monday to again lower its standard variable rate. ANZ has now cut its key mortgage rate to 6.99 percent from the 7.55 percent before Friday's official rate cut.
None of the other three major bank have followed the ANZ.
""The ANZ is now the most competitive bank on home rates of the majors,"" Costello said.
Mercer was later joined by fellow major Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) in hitting back at Costello's comment.
CBA released a statement challenging what it said were ""uninformed comments"" and a ""misapprehension"".
CBA also took out full-page advertisments in national newspapers advising Costello to take out CBA's no-frills home loan, which has a 6.7 percent rate.
""If you really want to save on a home loan Mr Costello, we'll tell you where to go,"" the advertisment read.

BernardHickey,"Macquarie Bank Ltd, Australia's largest locally-owned investment bank, posted a stronger than expected annual profit on Monday, citing bullish investment markets and a steady flow of corporate advisory work as the driving factors.
Macquarie's net profit for the year to March 31 jumped 25.4 percent to A$116.94 million (US$88.87 million), producing a return on average shareholder funds or equity of 25.2 percent.
Macquarie raised its annual dividend to 43 cents from 36 cents a year earlier on an earnings per share rise to 74.9 cents a share from 61 cents a share.
Analysts had forecast a net profit of around A$105 million.
""All five major business groups performed well,"" Macquarie Bank managing director Allan Moss told a news conference.
""We were assisted by favourable market conditions, with a good level of corporate activity and fairly strong security markets,"" he said.
The Australian stock market rose 8.7 percent over the year to March 31 and ten year bond yields fell to 8.16 percent from 8.81 percent.
Macquarie's Corporate Advisory division, which advises companies on takeovers and mergers, benefitted from an active year of corporate plays and had 130 advisory mandates, up significantly from 1995/96.
Among others, Macquarie advised Placer Dome Inc on its takeover of Highlands Gold Ltd and TNT on its response to Dutch postal and telecoms group KPN NV's takeover bid.
However, Macquarie's advisory work with TNT produced the bank's one major hiccup for the year.
One of Macquarie's most senior corporate advisory executives, Simon Hannes, was charged with insider trading last month after he allegedly bought TNT options before KPN's takeover bid and made a notional profit of A$2 million.
Hannes, who was not working on the TNT project, allegedly had access to TNT documents at Macquarie. His lawyers have said he would be pleading not guilty.
Moss said the Hannes matter had not affected corporate advisory work and was not expected to in the current year.
""Our perception is that flow of business was unaffected by the Hannes matter, because our clients recognise this matter relates to an individual and not the bank as a whole,"" Moss said.
Meanwhile, Moss and analysts said the outlook for Macquarie was as bullish as that for the market overall, due in large part to low interest rates.
""With interest rates continuing to be low and perhaps going down a little bit further, there's every prospect for a reasonably good year in equity markets and we're also seeing quite a good flow in corporate activity,"" he said.
Australian stocks have risen another eight percent since balance date, while bond markets have also strengthened further.
Analysts said the result was stronger than expected.
""It's all looking fairly healthy, given the outlook for the market in general,"" said one Sydney analyst, who had forecast a A$110 million profit.
Investors welcomed the result and talk of an eventual capital return, boosting its stock four cents to A$9.50 at the close, near its A$9.60 all-time high.
Moss said an expected change to the way Macquarie's capital adequacy ratio was calculated was likely to boost its ratio to 16 percent in coming years from its current 13.2 percent, raising the possibility of a capital return through a share buy back or higher dividend payout ratio.

BernardHickey,"The Sydney 2000 Olympics does not appear to be generating the economic bonanza many had hoped for and will not boost Sydney house prices, two construction and real estate forecasters said on Tuesday.
""The impact of the Olympics hasn't been as great as we'd been led to believe,"" Knight Frank Independent director Philip Ragan told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) seminar.
Construction of the games facilities and preparations for the games were in full swing, but were not yet adding significantly to the economy, Ragan said.
In 1993, when the Sydney was awarded the games, analysts forecast that the extra construction, tourism and jobs generated by the games would cumulatively add A$7 billion (US$5.3 billion) to A$8 billion to gross domestic product by 2001.
Ragan said the cumulative economic effect was likely to be closer to A$3 billion because of cost over-runs, lower revenue projections and the leakage of sponsorship revenues offshore.
""The outcome is coming in at the low end of expectations, in fact, significantly lower,"" Ragan said.
Olympics-related job creation had originally been estimated at about 150,000, but only 800 specific jobs had been created so far and only about 2,800 temporary jobs were seen in 2000, he said.
The state government and various private consortia are expected to spend about A$3.2 billion building new facilities.
But Ragan said this amount spent over four years was not a major increase on the A$10 billion spent each year on such construction in Sydney.
An expected nine percent rise in state government revenues and a trend towards higher savings would also swamp the Olympic-led boost to the local economy, he said.
""The effect of the Olympics is being more than overshadowed by other changes happening in the economy,"" he said.
BIS Schrapnel building and construction director Robert Mellor said he expected Sydney property prices to rise almost 40 percent in the lead up to the year 2000 and then slide in the years immediately after the Olympics.
But Mellor said this would have happened regardless of Sydney having the Olympics.
""It's got nothing to do with the Olympics. I don't see it having any effect,"" Mellor told the CEDA seminar.
""The positives may not be as great as the econometric models may indicate,"" he said.
The Atlanta Olympics had shown retailers and street traders had not done nearly as well as expected, Mellor said.
He pointed to the recent rash of legal actions by Atlanta's Olympic vendors against organisers for promising unrealistic likely incomes.
Those residential areas very close to the games site at Homebush Bay in Sydney's Western Suburbs may benefit from the new recreational facilities built there, but the bulk of Sydney's housing market would not notice.
He said the prospect of some home owners being able to rent out their homes for A$1,000 or A$2,000 for two weeks was unlikely to provide a general boost to the market.
""It just doesn't change the fundamental reason for buying a house in Sydney,"" he said.

BernardHickey,"Australian-based soft drink bottler Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCA) announced on Wednesday it had settled the final details of its share swap deal with San Miguel Corp of the Philippines to create the world's second largest Coca-Cola bottler.
CCA originally announced the deal in April, but was forced to look again at its details after some San Miguel shareholders protested that San Miguel would not have enough boardroom influence and had given away strong cashflows too cheaply.
CCA said on Wednesday the initial terms of the deal had been confirmed, with CCA buying San Miguel's stake in a soft drink bottling joint venture in the Philippines in exchange for issuing San Miguel a 25 percent stake in CCA.
CCA's parent group, The Coca-Cola Co, which had owned 30 percent of the joint venture with San Miguel, will have its shareholding in CCA diluted to 33 percent from 36 percent.
The A$3.7 billion (US$2.8 billion) deal creates a company with annual sales of almost A$4 billion, production of over one billion cases of soft drink and profits of almost A$300 million.
But CCA said the number of San Miguel represenatives on the CCA board would be increased to four from the initially agreed three, helping to allay some San Miguel shareholder concerns.
""This development will broaden and deepen the pool of experience and advice available to management and shareholders as CCA expands its business both in the Philippines and world-wide,"" CCA chairman Dean Wills said in a statement.
CCA shareholders welcomed the confirmation of the deal, initially bumping CCA's shares up 62 cents or about four percent to a new 1997 high of A$16.02 as lingering concerns about a renegotiation were wiped away.
CCA however eased back to A$15.85 near the close after some profit-taking and some analysts' comments that the deal's confirmation was no surprise.
""The deal to all intents and purposes was done. The only fiddling was at the margins,"" said one Sydney analyst who asked not to be named. ""It just means they're going to have to build a very big board table,"" the analyst said.
Initial news of the deal in March pulled CCA's share price out of a five month 40 percent slump brought on by a profit downgrade.
""It buys them time and strengthens their cash flow,"" said another Sydney analyst.
Investors in the Philippines were however less impressed.
San Miguel's A shares were down a full peso at 49 pesos in late trade as Philippines investors digested the news that San Miguel would not get a higher proportion of CCA.
""It is good news but in terms of bottom line, San Miguel did not get an additional stake, just an additional vote,"" said Noel Reyes, research head at Anscor-Hagedorn Securities.
""The impact is not that positive. They have just given up control of a major cash cow, it is as simple as that,"" said Helen Alvarez, research director at All Asia Securities.
The deal will be put to put to CCA shareholders within the next month for formal approval.
CCA already operates 43 bottling plants in 17 countries in Australasia, Asia and Eastern Europe and will be second only to its Coca Cola Co parent as a Coca Cola producer.

BernardHickey,"Australasian-based building products group James Hardie Industries Ltd posted weaker annual profits on Wednesday, but forecast its expanding U.S. fibre cement and gypsum units would drive a profit surge in 1997/98.
""For the first time in several years we have the production capacity to meet U.S. market demand,"" James Hardie managing director Keith Barton said.
""If current trading conditions prevail, we expect very strong growth in (U.S.) sales and earnings to continue in the year ahead,"" Barton told a briefing for analysts and reporters.
""(Group) operating profit after tax for the current year will improve significantly compared to the past year,"" he said.
James Hardie's net profit jumped to A$83 million (US$63 million) in the year to March 31 from A$32.2 million in 1995/96, but this was due largely to a A$31.7 million abnormal profit from asset sales.
Profit before abnormals fell 12.3 percent to A$51.3 million because of sharply lower Australasian buliding materials profits and this was in line with expectations.
But Barton's comments at the briefing about continuing weakness in the Australian and New Zealand building materials markets prompted some analysts to downgrade their forecasts for the 1997/98 year.
James Hardies' Australian operations, hit by a 12 percent fall in home construction, slumped to a A$800,000 pre-tax loss in 1996/97 from a A$33.8 million profit in 1995/96.
New Zealand profits fell eight percent to A$31.9 million.
Barton said competition in Australia and New Zealand remained intense and would continue to slice away at sales, margins and profits in 1997/98.
""The modest recovery in Australian housing construction will not be sufficient to offset the impact of growing competition on our Australian fibre cement business,"" Barton said.
Increased imports would pressure margins and volumes in New Zealand, he said.
Barton also told the analysts briefing that new competition coming on stream in the United States and James Hardie's drive to increase market share there would pressure prices down.
""We may have to discount ... be more aggressive against engineered wood products and against PVC,"" he said.
""But that doesn't necessarily mean a reduction in margins,"" he said, adding sales volumes would continue to grow and economies of scale were still to be obtained, Barton said.
Some analysts said Barton's comments about Australasian weakness and U.S. price pressure would force them to downgrade their 1997/98 pre-abnormal profit forecasts to about A$80 million to A$85 million from A$90 million to A$90 million before the results.
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett building materials analyst Fabian Babich said he would keep his 1997/98 forecast at A$80 million.
Hardie kept its final dividend for 1996/97 unchanged at 6.5 cents per share, taking full year dividends to an unchanged 13.0 cents per share.
Hardie is about 28 percent owned by Brierley Investments Ltd.
Hardie's shares closed down 15 cents at A$4.05.

BernardHickey,"Brokers Were Stockbroking and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett had placed all of The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd's 616.6 million Foster's Brewing Group Ltd shares with institutions and private clients by early on Friday, Were said.
Retail investors bought about A$150 million of the A$1.535 billion package of shares, with about 55 percent of the remainder being sold to overseas institutional investors and about 45 percent sold to local institutions, Were Stockbroking managing director John Paterson said.  
Paterson pointed to a A$2.5 billion-equivalent placement of three percent of The British Petroleum Co Plc shares in May as possibly the largest such placement this year.
The Kuwait Investment Office sold three percent or 170 million of BP's shares through Goldman Sachs in mid-May this year for about 7.0 stg per share.
Paterson said the two brokers began placing the stock at about 3.30 p.m. (0530 GMT) on Thursday after Foster's announced the buy-back of 13.0 percent of its capital from Asahi Breweries Ltd and BHP's placement of 616.6 million Foster's shares. The buy-back and placement were at A$2.49 per share.  
Were and ABN AMRO's Australian offices worked until very late on Thursday night before handing it over to their New York and European offices.
Paterson said the buy-back was completed at about 9.00 a.m. (2330 GMT).
""We had strong institutional support in Australia, similarly in London and Europe, particularly London, and in the United States,"" Paterson said.
Private client support from Were's New Zealand and Australian clients was also strong, he said.  
""The other satisfying fact is you tend to assume after one of these deals that you've exhausted the demand in the market place, but with the stock trading up at A$2.55 against the placement price of A$2.49, it says there's still quite a lot of untapped demand out there,"" he said.
Foster's shares were down five cents at A$2.55 at 1.40 p.m. (0340 GMT) on 675 million shares put through the market.
Foster's said on Thursday it expected foreign investors to hold about a third of its shares after the reconstruction.  
Foster's said BHP had agreed to limit individual investors to parcels of no more than five percent of BHP's Foster's shares.
Paterson said the successful completion of the deal was satisfying for Were and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett and they were now looking forward to a rest.

BradDorfman,"First Bank System Inc is seen paying a premium price to expand its geographic footprint to the Pacific Northwest with its planned $9 billion acquisition of Portland, Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp.
""This is very rich pricing,"" analyst James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp said, noting that the deal -- which would make First Bank the 14th largest bank in the United States based on assets -- values U.S. Bancorp at about $59.08 a share, or 19.2 times 1996 earnings.  
U.S. Bancorp shares were up 6-3/16 at 54-7/16 Thursday.
But at the same time, First Bank chief executive John Grundhofer's reputation for aggressive cost cutting, the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with Minneapolis-based First Bank's mostly Midwestern markets, and the rich price of bank stocks in general, make the deal palatable to analysts.
""It's a natural fit for them,"" said Frank Barkocy, analyst at Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross. ""It's a natural extension of their marketplace.""  
First Bank said it would be able to grow revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base. Home equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp's customers, while U.S. Bancorp's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers, the banks said.
""Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,"" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group.  
First Bank expects to cut the combined banks' operating expenses by about 14 percent, with a pre-tax cost savings of about $340 million.
""We believe that (First Bank's) ability to cut costs could make this deal work,"" Salomon Brothers said in a note on the deal, according to market sources.
While First Bank stock was down 3-1/2 at 74-3/4 Thursday, analysts still saw the deal as a positive for the acquisition minded bank.
""They've got the acqusition history behind them,"" Biggar said. ""They've got a management that can make deals work.""  
The deal could also spark more bank consolidation, especially in the Midwest, with buyers swooping in while First Bank is busy consolidating its purchase, analysts said.
""We expect this announcement could trigger other activity,"" Salomon Brothers said, according to market sources.
Among potential targets frequently mentioned are Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp and Cleveland-based KeyCorp. Schutz even argues that Chicago-based First Chicago NBD Corp could be an attractive target at a reasonable price.
""For bang for the buck, First Chicago is probably the most lucrative"" in terms of Midwest markets, he said.

The deal between Minneapolis-based First Bank and U.S. Bancorp, a regional bank based in Portland, Ore., will also result in the loss of about 4,000 jobs, the banks said.
Under a definitive agreement, U.S. Bancorp shareholders will receive, in a tax-free exchange, 0.755 share of First Bank common stock for each U.S. Bancorp share they own.
Based on First Bank's trading price of $74.875 Thursday, which was down $3.375, the purchase price equals $56.53 a share for holders of U.S. Bancorp, whose shares jumped $6.50 to $54.75.

First Bank said it expected pretax cost savings of about $340 million from the merger, with combined operating expenses being reduced by 14 percent.
First Bank said it would take pretax charges of $625 million for costs related to the merger, which was expected to close by the end of June.
It also said the deal was expected to add to its earnings per share starting in the second quarter of next year. By 1999, First Bank sees about an 8 percent addition to earnings per share.
First Bank said it would be able to increase revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base.

""Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,"" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group.
Grundhofer will be president and chief executive of the new company, which will take the U.S. Bancorp name but remain based in Minneapolis.
U.S. Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will serve as chairman of the merged bank until his retirement in 1998.

First Bank said it expected pretax cost savings of about $340 million from the merger, with combined operating expenses being reduced by 14 percent.
First Bank said it would take pretax charges of $625 million for costs related to the merger, which was expected to close by the end of June.
While it was too soon to say specifically which jobs would be cut in the merger, the majority of jobs affected will be in the Portland area, bank officials said. Both banks have instituted hiring freezes to help minimize the number of people losing jobs, the banks said.
First Bank said the deal was expected to add to its earnings per share starting in the second quarter of next year. By 1999, First Bank sees about an 8 percent addition to earnings per share.
First Bank said it would be able to increase revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base.
Home equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp's customers, while U.S. Bancorp's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers, the banks said.
""Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,"" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group.
Grundhofer will be president and chief executive of the new company, which will take the U.S. Bancorp name but remain based in Minneapolis.
U.S. Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will serve as chairman of the merged bank until his retirement in 1998.
Since 1991, First Bank has made 23 acquisitions, including the $717 million acquisition of Nebraska-based FirsTier Financial Inc. in 1996.
Cameron said he was first approached by Grundhofer about a deal in early November.
""I frankly told him he should go talk to someone else that was interested,"" Cameron told reporters during a conference call. But he said he felt a responsibility to shareholders to hear Grundhofer out and the two discussed the deal around Thanskgiving.
After subsequent meetings and a review that ended last weekend, both sides were even more convinced the deal made sense, he said.

BradDorfman,"Cobra Electronics Corp said Monday it expects to report increases in revenue and profits in 1997, after the company reported a profitable year in 1996, its first year in the black since 1989.
""We are expecting double-digit revenue growth and a significant increase in profit,"" chief executive officer Jerry Kalov said in an interview.
The company reported revenue of $90.3 million in 1996 and net income of $601,000 in 1996, compared to revenue of $90.4 million and a loss of $1.1 million a year ago.  
After completing a cost-cutting program in 1996, Cobra is looking to its new radar and laser detection products and a comeback in the citizens band radio market to help fuel revenue growth.
The company is currently introducing a system called Safety Alert, which expands on its radar dectector technology to allow drivers to receive a signal alerting them to emergency vehicles, oncoming trains and construction and other equipment that might cause an accident.
The company plans to sell the detector, which mounts on a windshield for about $69.95, Kalov said.  
The signal comes from a transmitter that sells for about $300 and is mounted in the light panel of emergency vehicles, he said. The company hopes municipalities will be interested in purchasing the transmitters to help avoid costly accidents to their vehicles.
""It's going to take some time, because municipalities don't have a lot of money,"" Kalov said about selling transmitters.
The company is also introducing a product for about $149 that combines Safety Alert, a radar detector and a system to warn drivers when police are using laser to trap speeders in an area.  
In fact, the growing use of laser by police should spur sales in the company's detection equipment, Kalov said.
""As more and more laser guns are showing up, we believe it's going to create a spurt"" in laser detector sales, he said.
Cobra currently has about 15 percent of the detection market, but it expects its market share to grow to 20 to 25 percent by the end of the year, he said.
The company also has about a 35 to 40 percent market share in CB radios, its largest business. It sees that share rising to 50 percent with introduction of technology that reduces background noise and with new distribution channels.  
Kalov said use of CBs, which peaked in the 1970s, is rebounding as people become used to the mobile communications of cellular phones for emergencies but don't want to pay cellular phone charges.
CB radios also serve a ""chat-room"" function, allowing drivers to get recommendations for restaurants and information on road conditions, Kalov said.
The company also maintains a niche profile in the cordless telephone market with less than three percent of the market. Kalov said that the company's goal is to have three to five percent of that market.

BradDorfman,"U.S. retailers are expected to post sales gains in the single digits for March, bolstered by low-end discount stores sales while department store performance was nearly flat compared with a year ago.
""It appears there's a slowdown in the department store end of the business, but the discounters are still doing well,"" Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said.
Overall, he expects comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be up about 5 percent or slightly less.
An early Easter could depress sales at stores that were closed on the holiday, which fell in the March selling period instead of April this year. Winter storms in much of the northern part of the nation may have also held sales back.
""You need to look at March and April overall to get comparable sales,"" William Armstrong, an analyst at Fahnestock &amp; Co. Inc. said of quirks in the reporting calendar, where some retailers include Easter in March and others in April this year.
Armstrong is expecting overall retail sales for March to increase by 2 percent to 4 percent.
Most retailers will report March sales early Thursday. But Plano, Tex.-based J.C. Penney Co. Inc. Tuesday reported a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales at its JCPenney stores in March. The early report was due to a debt offering the company is making this week.
The loss of one day's sales because of Easter hurt sales, J.C. Penney said.
Penney's decline is expected to be mirrored by other department stores, analysts said.
""Most (department store) chains saw flat or even slightly lower comparable sales during the March period, as they compared with healthy year-ago increases,"" analysts at Montgomery Securities wrote in a research report. They added that the early Easter and snowstorms in the Northeast added to pressure on sales.
At the same time, discount stores are expected to post 4 percent to 6 percent sales gains, with low-end discounters reporting low double-digit gains, Montgomery said.
""We continue to believe the low-end strata is benefitting from the fruits of a fully-employed economy and the direct pay-hike from the 1996 minimum wage increase,"" Montgomery's analysts wrote.
Among the major chains, analysts see Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, reporting same-store sales gains of about 7 percent. Sears, Roebuck and Co. was expected to report gains of 2 percent to 3 percent, with Kmart Corp. up 10 percent to 12 percent.
Kmart's results are expected to be driven by seasonal items, such as horticulture, home goods and bicycles. But it will give back some of those gains in April because of the calendar shift, analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a research note. Kmart stores were open on Easter, analysts added.
Dayton Hudson Corp. is expected to post a 1 percent to 2 percent gain, with a 3 percent to 4 percent increase at its Target discount stores offsetting flat department store sales. Federated Department Stores Inc. is expected to post flat sales, with some planned promotions moved into April, analysts said.

BradDorfman,"Midwest regional banks should continue their trend of low double-digit earnings growth in the 1997 first quarter, with expense control, steady loan growth and share buybacks pacing results.
""We ought to see more of what we've been seeing -- slow loan growth, good expense control and share buybacks"" boosting earnings per share, Michael Ancell, banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones, said.  
That earnings trend, which has been evident for Midwest banks for several quarters, is also expected to continue much of the year, even if the Federal Reserve raises rates again.
""A quarter point, or (50 basis point) or whatever higher federal funds rate doesn't make too much difference as far as what the year will look like,"" Thomas Maier, analyst at EVEREN Securities, said.
With adjustable rate loans and more banks deriving revenues from fees and other areas, fluctuations in interest rates have less impact on bank earnings than in the past, analysts said.  
Rising rates could pressure thrift earnings later this year, analysts warn.
""Inherently, it's much more difficult to match the rate sensitivity of both sides of their balance sheets,"" Ben Crabtree, analyst at Dain Bosworth, said. ""They don't have much in the way of adjustable rate loans.""
While earnings growth looks strong for the rest of the year for Midwest banks, analysts are eying consumer loans, including credit card loans, for signs of higher delinquencies and charge offs.  
First Chicago NBD Corp last month warned of a difficult credit environment for its card business for the rest of the year.
Credit concerns could also slow consumer loan growth, analysts noted.
""We're expecting consumer loan growth to have slowed for a number of these companies, with bankers becoming a little more gun-shy,"" Ancell said.
The following are first quarter mean estimates, according to First Call, compared with 1996 first quarter actual earnings:

BradDorfman,"Shares of Sears, Roebuck and Co, the nation's second largest retailer, fell about six percent Thursday after the company said it will voluntarily refund some payments from credit card holders who filed for bankruptcy.
Sears said the repayments might have a material effect on 1997 earnings. But analysts said the company could not quantify its earnings exposure during a conference call.
Sears stock was down 3-1/8 to 47-3/4.  
The dispute is over a process called reaffirmations, where Sears approaches holders of Sears credit cards who have filed for bankruptcy and attempts to have them make payment to Sears rather than having the debt and their Sears credit wiped out in bankruptcy court.
The reaffirmation agreements must be filed with a bankruptcy court. Sears said Thursday some of the agreements were not filed properly.
While Sears could not say how much it might have to refund to debtors, the company did say it had $400 million in reaffirmations from 1992 through February 1997, analysts said.  
Analysts noted that some of the reaffirmations were properly filed. But Sears may also be subject to other court sanctions.
The retailer told analysts it would offer each debtor affected a $100 gift certificate.
A Sears spokeswoman was not immediately available to confirm analysts' comments.
""It (the earnings impact) could end up being $0.50 to $1.00 a share and that's a lot,"" said Peter Schaeffer, analyst at Dillon, Read.  
Analysts also said that Sears defined ""material"" as anything over five percent of annual net income. Based on analysts estimates for 1997 earnings, that could mean a minimum cost of about $70 million to 1997 earnings, analysts said.
But analysts also said it was too early to say how much impact the credit card problem would have.
""They (Sears officials) don't know,"" said Karen Sack, analyst at S &amp; P Equity Group. ""They can't quantify it until they do a full investigation.""
The company also said same store sales rose one percent in March, slightly below expectations.
But the credit card problem was what was hurting the stock, analysts said.
""Granted, sales were somewhat disappointing,"" said Joseph Ronning, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""But this came out of the blue.""

BradDorfman,"USG Corp, maker of building products such as wallboard, is looking to double its earnings by the early 2000s from its 1995 base.
""By the early 2000s, we would like to double the bottomline of our company,"" USG chief executive William Foote said in an interview.
He said that goal was based on its 1995 earnings. The company reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $417 million in 1995.
EBITDA rose to $437 million in 1996 for the company.
USG plans to achieve this by growing revenues with production expansion and through cost cutting initiatives, Foote said.
The company is also seeking to have its debt rating raised to investment grade -- triple-B or better -- by the end of 1998, Foote said. The rating is currently double-B-plus.
The company currently spends about $150 million a year on capital improvements and $150 million a year to pay down debt. Once investment grade rating is reached, more of the company's cash will be spent on expanding capacity and improving costs, Foote said.
On Thursday, USG said its United States Gypsum Co unit will spend at least $85 million to build a facility to manufacture gypsum wood fiber panels, a building product the company plans to position between its less expensive wallboard product and more expensive cement board.
In November, the company announced plans to build a new, lower-cost wallboard manufacturing facility in Bridgeport, Ala. for $110 million. The company also last year said it would spend $35 million to modernize a Cloquet, Minn. plant.
Foote would not rule out announcing another new facility plan by the end of 1997.
""There are no plans that are imminent but I can't say that that might not happen,"" Foote said.
He also conceded that the new gypsum wood fiber product could cannabalize sales of the company's other products, but noted that this would free USG up to sell to more customers in the wallboard market.
""It would allow us to increase our (wallboard) market share,"" Foote said. ""We are able to sell all the Sheetrock (wallboard) we make right now.""
USG shares closed up 1/2 at 32-3/4 Thursday.

BradDorfman,"Banyan Strategic Realty Trust, which releases its full 1996 results early next week, will report funds from operations (FFO) of $0.03 a share for the 1996 fourth quarter, down from $0.07 a share a year ago.
Leonard Levine, chief executive of the real estate investment trust also said Friday that funds from operations for the year ended December 31 would be $0.34 a share, up from $0.32 a share a year ago.
But the company expects funds from operations, the standard measure of a REITs performance, to jump in 1997.  
""In 1997, we expect our targeted numbers for FFO, both as a result of acquisitions made in late '96 and continuing acquisitions in early '97...will be somewhere between $0.50 and $0.55,"" Levine said in an interview.
The company's target for 1998 FFO is $0.65 to $0.70 a share, not including additional acquisitions, which it expects to make.
By June 30 of this year, Banyan expects to own 19 properties in the Midwest and Southeast, including industrial buildings, suburban office buildings, apartment complexes and a retail center.  
""Real estate is cyclical and the best way to protect against that cycle is to spread your risk,"" Levine said in explaining Banyan's strategy, which is counter to most REITs, which focus on one property sector.
The company focuses on markets without much competition from larger REITs.  
""Our principal investment strategy is to focus on smaller real estate markets and smaller properties where we believe there continues to be extraordinary opportunities available to us to purchase stable and appreciating real estate and where the economies are both very strong and there continues to be an absence of credit and capital,"" Levine said.
Banyan buys properties with an eye toward both improving its revenue stream and selling at a profit down the road.
The company hopes to speed its portfolio growth in coming years and Levine expects Banyan to make some sort of equity offering in the next year to raise market capital.
""I think sometime within the next 12 months we'll be exploring ways in which the company can grow from that perspective,"" Levine said of a potential equity offering.
Among the benefits from an equity offering would be to improve Banyan's liquidity, he added.
Shares of the company closed Wednesday at four and have not traded since.

BradDorfman,"Caterpillar Inc. reported a first-quarter profit of $394 million Tuesday, the best quarter in the company's history and up 33 percent from a year ago.
Caterpillar also said it now expects 1997 profits will be higher than the $1.4 billion it posted in 1996, based on expectations for ""moderately higher"" sales.
The outlook is a switch from January, when Caterpillar forecast profits near 1996 levels.
The Peoria, Ill.-based heavy equipment maker reported earnings of $394 million, or $2.08 a share, well above the Wall Street consensus of $1.69 a share. Sales and revenues were $4.26 billion.
A year earlier, Caterpillar earned $296 million, or $1.53 a share, on revenues of $3.84 billion.
Caterpillar shares rose $2.375 to $81.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
""This is just a very, very solid operating quarter,"" said J. Blair Brumley, an analyst who follows Caterpillar at Dain Bbosworth Inc.
Gross profit margins helped drive earnings in the quarter, rising to 26.8 percent of machinery and engine sales from 24.5 percent a year ago.
The rise in profit margins was primarily due to higher prices, higher physical sales volume, a favourable change in geographic sales mix, lower sales discounts and the net effect of the stronger dollar.
But the favourable effect of the stronger dollar on costs incurred in Japanese yen and European currencies was substantially offset by the negative impact on prices.
If the dollar remains too strong vs. the yen, the company could be forced to cut prices because of competition from Japanese companies, Caterpillar said.
""So far...  the (negative) impact's been very minimal and a large part of that is the fact that we've restructured our business so we know how to manage an overvalued dollar,"" Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Douglas Oberhelman said in an interview. ""No question that if the dollar continues to be overvalued and continues to be strong, we'll see some price erosion later in the year.""
Sales in the United States were $2.17 billion, up 15 percent from a year ago. Sales outside the United States were $1.90 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago.
Sales volume in the quarter was up 9 percent, while prices improved 2 percent, Caterpillar said.
Caterpillar did hedge its forecast for the year, saying greater-than-expected interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and lingering weakness in European demand could hurt results. Last month the Fed raised short term interest rates by one-quarter percentage point in a bid to ward off inflationary pressures.
""We're expecting another 50-75 basis points (one-half to three-quarter percentage point in rate increases) probably this year before they finish,"" Oberhelman said of the Fed. ""That's in our plan. Anything over and above that, we'd be concerned about.""
Caterpillar noted that the economic and industry outlook improved from January because the United States and Canada are now expected to have better economic growth and higher machine industry demand than originally anticipated.
The company said it expected U.S. gross domestic product to rise 3 percent in 1997, up from the 2 percent it expected earlier.

That restructuring includes more overseas production, he said.
But the continued strength in the dollar, which is at a multi-year high against the yen, could lead to pricing competition from Japanese competitors later this year, Oberhelman said.
""No question that if the dollar continues to be overvalued and continues to be strong, we'll see some price erosion later in the year,"" Oberhelman said.  
""So far, it's not been the predatory pricing that we've seen in the past from our competitors,"" he said.
Earlier Tuesday, Caterpillar said it expected 1997 profits to rise from 1996 on ""moderately higher"" sales.
That forecast anticipates additional tightening by the Federal Reserve this year.
""We're expecting another 50-75 basis points probably this year before we finish,"" Oberhelman said. ""That's in our plan. anything over and above that, we'd be concerned about.""

BradDorfman,"Kmart Corp., in another bid to spruce up its discount stores, said Wednesday it will spend $750 million over the next three years to convert nearly all of the outlets to a new concept called ""Big Kmart.""
The new Big Kmarts are designed to help shoppers save time and money and bring them back more often by reorganizing merchandise and displaying it in wider, easier-to-access aisles.
""This new store signals real change, a new beginning, a new Kmart, bigger and better in every respect,"" Chairman Floyd Hall said at an unveiling of the Big Kmart concept at the Chicago Brickyard Mall.
The Big Kmart concept is expected to add significantly to sales at existing stores.
""We would look for a 20 percent gain in any given store in sales per square foot,"" Hall said in an interview.
The Big Kmart prototypes, under development for 18 months, have previously been called Kmart's ""high frequency"" concept. So far 297 stores have been converted. Another 333 are slated for conversion in 1997. Most of the remainder of Kmart's more than 2,000 traditional stores will be converted by 1999.
Big Kmart stores, not to be confused with another concept, the Super Kmart Centre, are the same size as the 60,000 to 80,000 square feet traditional stores.
The Big Kmart concept groups merchandise into three areas: home fashions, including towels, bedding, dinnerware and appliances, located near the front of the store; childrens' apparel and toys, near ladies and mens apparel; and consumables, including health and beauty care products, near the centre of the store.
Big Kmart stores will also feature a new Pantry department filled with more food and household products, paper products and pet supplies.
""We don't really look for a customer to choose us over a grocery store,"" Hall said. ""We're offering it up as a convenience to our customers.""
The Big Kmart stores will not duplicate the full grocery sections offered in the firm's 97 Super Kmart Centres.
Kmart, the nation's third largest retailer, has launched previous programmes to draw shoppers into its discount stores, which have been criticised as dirty and disorganized.
In 1990, former Kmart chairman Joseph Antonini launched a massive store renovation programme that also updated the company's logo. However, the changes failed to bring Kmart up to the standards set by archrivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target.
Hall said the company plans to open seven traditional stores and three Super Kmart Centres in 1997 and concentrate its efforts on opening 35 new Big Kmart stores and 15 to 18 Super Kmart Centres in 1998.

BradDorfman,"Harnischfeger Industries Inc. said Friday it offered to buy Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc., a Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based maker of industrial automation products and machine tools, for about $747 million, including assumption of debt.
It said the $19-per-share offer has a value of about $747 million, based on the approximately 33.2 million shares of Giddings &amp; Lewis stock now outstanding and including the assumption of Giddings &amp; Lewis debt.
The price represents a premium of about 40 percent over Friday's closing price on Giddings &amp; Lewis's stock of $13.625 per share.
Harnischfeger Chief Executive officer Jeffery Glade said the company would have to take on ""significant"" debt to finance the deal, but added that financing was in place.
""It's fully financed, no contingencies,"" Glade said in an interview. He added that he expected the deal would add to Harnischfeger earnings immediately upon closing and that with growth, the debt would be paid down quickly.
He added that Milwaukee-based Harnischfeger would use Giddings &amp; Lewis to help improve its aftermarket service to the machine tool and material handling business.
""We'll be within 24 hours of any major plant in the United States,"" Glade said. ""That's what happens if you put our business with ours.""
Harnischfeger is not looking to cut plants or lay off employees if it succeeds in its offer, Glade said.
""What we intend to do is grow this little baby,"" Glade said. ""We think we can sell more and become a better service provider.""
The transaction would create an enterprise with combined 1996 revenues of $3.6 billion with operations in mining equipment, pulp and papermaking machinery, and industrial products and services.
Harnischfeger said it made its offer in a letter dated April 25 from Glade to Giddings &amp; Lewis President and Chief Executive Officer Marvin Isles.
Harnischfeger had been talking to Giddings &amp; Lewis about an acquisition since Monday, then made the offer Friday after receiving what it considered a rejection from Giddings &amp; Lewis' board, Glade said.
Giddings &amp; Lewis would not comment on its discussions with Harnischfeger.
In a news release late Friday, the company urged shareholders not to act on the Harnischfeger offer until its board of directors reviewed the offer and the company's alternatives.
Harnischfeger is an international holding company with businesses involved in the manufacture and distribution of equipment for underground mining, surface mining, pulp and papermaking and material handling.
Glade said Harnischfeger had alternatives to Giddings &amp; Lewis, but that Giddings &amp; Lewis was the best choice. He would not say at what price Giddings &amp; Lewis remains the best alternative. Harnischfeger shares closed at closed down $1 at $45.375 Friday.

BradDorfman,"Harnischfeger Industries Inc chief executive officer Jeffery Glade thinks acquiring Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin-based Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc is his company's best option as it tries to become dominant in the fragment machine tool and material handling business.
But whether or not Harnischfeger's $747 million unsolicited tender offer for Giddings is successful, the company is still looking for other acquisitions.  
""This is not our last acquisition in this industrial product service group,"" Glade said in an interview late Friday.
Grade said the industry, which he estimated as more than an $80 billion business, ""is poorly served. It is fragmented. No one is a lion's share owner of it.""
He sees acquiring Giddings, a supplier of industrial automation products and machine tools, as a way of improving Milwaukee-based Harnischfeger's aftermarket service to the machine tool and material handling business.  
""We'll be within 24 hours of any major plant in the United States,"" Glade said. ""That's what happens if you put their business with ours.""
Glade said Harnischfeger announced the $19 a share tender offer for Giddings, which closed Friday at $13.625, after discussing an acqusition with the company since last Monday.
He said Giddings' board of directors Friday issued what Harnischfeger considered a rejection to the offer, asking for a two year ""stand still"" agreement while it tried to convince Harnischfeger it was worth more. Under the agreement, Harnischfeger would not be able to try to acquire Giddings.  
""My own view is they decided they wanted a public auction,"" Glade said.
Giddings would not comment on any discussions it had with Harnischfeger.
In a statement Friday, Giddings urged shareholders not to respond to Harnischfeger's offer until its board of directors reviews the offer and other alternatives.
""The true value of (Giddings) shares is not reflected in the marketplace,"" Marvin Isles, Giddings chief executive, said in a news release.  
But Glade said the offer for Giddings was fair.
""It's a darn good offer, 40 percent over the market for a machine tool business most analysts are pretty cautious about,"" Glade said.
According to First Call, the consensus recommendation of 12 analysts who follow Giddings rates the company closer to hold than buy.
Harnischfeger will have to take on a ""significant"" amount of new debt to finance its bid for Giddings, but has the financing in place, Glade said. He expects the debt to be paid down in two to four years and thinks the acquisition would be accretive to earnings as soon as it closed.
That accretion would come from growing the business, not shutting plants and laying off people, he said.
""What we intend to do is grow this little baby,"" Glade said. ""We think we can sell more and become a better service provider when we combine our strategy.""
""We have other alternatives to (Giddings), but I would tell you (Giddings) is the best opportunity at this moment,"" he said. He would not say at what price Giddings is not the best alternative for Harnischfeger.

BradDorfman,"The stock of Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc. jumped Monday amid speculation that Harnischfeger Industries Inc. would boost its hostile $631 million takeover offer for the supplier of machine tools or that another suitor would make a bid.
Analysts were sceptical that Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based machine tool and industrial automation products maker Giddings would see a much higher bid than the $19-a-share tender offer Harnischfeger announced Friday.
""I don't think there's much more in that Harnischfeger bid than what's in there, and I don't think there's anyone else out there"" that would make a higher bid, Thomas Burns Jr., analyst at NatWest Securities, said.
The stock of Giddings, which also makes industrial automation equipment, soared $6.73 to $20.36 in active trading of more than 10.1 million shares on the Nasdaq market.
""People are expecting a higher bid,"" one trader said.
Harnischfeger's unsolicited bid of $19 a share for Giddings has a total value of $747 million including assumption of Giddings debt.
Giddings has asked its stockholders not to act on the offer until its board reviews the proposal. Giddings also said it retained Credit Suisse First Boston to explore all strategic alternatives.
Many analysts think that Harnischfeger's bid will prove to be successful.
While saying the Harnischfeger bid was not a done deal, ""We expect (Harnischfeger) to pursue its target with vigour and would be surprised if another offer significantly higher than the one now on the table would surface,"" J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosowrth Inc., said.
Harnischfeger said it is looking at using Giddings &amp; Lewis to expand in the fragmented industrial products aftermarket service business, which Harnischfeger estimates as an $80 billion market.
But some analysts said buying Giddings &amp; Lewis, a company that took a $64.1 million charge last year to try to fix its integrated automation systems business, adds a lot of uncertainty for Harnischfeger shareholders.
""...We believe that investors will be looking at a fundamentally different company with much more risk involved than they had previously,"" Brumley wrote in a research note, in which he also lowered the rating of Harnischfeger to a hold from a buy.
But some analysts said Harnischfeger has picked a perfect time to go after Giddings &amp; Lewis. Giddings &amp; Lewis has already taken steps to fix its underperforming operations, but the stock, in their opinion, still is ailing, they said.
""They got all the dirty work behind them,"" said Darren Bagwell, analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co Inc. ""They've wiped the slate clean, and yet the stock price still reflects that wait and see attitude.""
In fact, Bagwell also said Giddings &amp; Lewis could probably squeeze a higher bid out of somebody and said he felt the company was worth more than $19 a share.
Harnischfeger Industries stock fell $3.125 to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

BradDorfman,"Harnischfeger Industries Inc's $19 a share tender offer for industrial tool and systems maker Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc could be about the best offer Giddings can get, industry analysts said Monday.
""I don't think there's much more in that Harnischfeger bid than what's in there, and I don't think there's anyone else out there"" that would make a higher bid, Thomas Burns Jr., analyst at NatWest Securities, said.  
Shares of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based Giddings &amp; Lewis jumped 6-3/4 to 20-3/8 Monday. That was seen as an indication that some buyers expect a higher bid, a view many analysts take issue with.
""My feeling is at $19 a share, that's full value, I think, for Giddings &amp; Lewis,"" said William Cooke, analyst at McDonald &amp; Co. ""I think that Harnischfeger is assuming they can double the earnings of Giddings &amp; Lewis in the not too distant future. I think they're being optimistic.""

Some analysts also noted that Harnischfeger's bid was likely based only on publicly available information and that a bidder who had a good look at Giddings &amp; Lewis books might find information to convince them to make a higher offer.
Harnischfeger shares were down 3-5/8 at 41-3/4 Monday.

BradDorfman,"Talks between Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers will resume with the help of a federal mediator, the parties said Friday, almost a year and a half after striking workers returned to the work at the heavy machinery maker.
No date has been set for the talks called by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The talks would be the first formal negotiations since November 1995, when a tentative agreement, subsequently rejected, was submitted to UAW members.
The 17-month strike ended in December 1995 without a new contract. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar's workers have been without a contract since 1991.
Neither Caterpillar nor the union would say if any specific event occurred to spur new talks.
""As a result of conversations between FMCS, UAW and Caterpillar, I have called a meeting of the parties for a discussion of the issues between them,"" John Calhoun Wells, FMCS director, said in a statement.
A union official said jobs and job security have been main issues throughout negotiations, while almost 400 unfair labour practice complaints by the UAW and seniority problems have also become issues.
""I've always felt that there's going to come a time when it would make a good business decision for the company"" to reach a labour agreement, Jim Clingan, executive vice president of UAW local 974 in Peoria, said. But he added that he did not know if that time has been reached.
Caterpillar has reported record profits in the wake of the strike and analysts have said the continuing labour woes have had little, if any, impact on the company's bottom line.
""(Caterpillar is) not going to budge enough for it to make a difference,"" said J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. ""Even if they get a contract, it's not going to look very different than what those guys are working under now.""
Caterpillar reported profit of $1.4 billion on revenues of $16.52 billion in 1996.
In a statement, Cateprillar vice president Wayne Zimmerman called the resumption of meetings ""a positive development.""
""It's long past time to resolve the uncertainty this dispute has created for our employees,"" Zimmerman said.
UAW president Stephen Yokich also welcomed Wells' announcement.
""It is clearly in the best interests of all stakeholders, including communities and families, that the long-standing labour dispute be resolved equitably,"" Yockich said in a statement.
Caterpillar shares rose $2.625 to $93.375 in line with other capital equipment makers.
Brumley noted that when the news of the announcement was made, Caterpillar shares traded lower briefly.

BradDorfman,"Huntington Bancshares Inc. said Monday it agreed to acquire First Michigan Bank Corp., a Michigan banking company, in a deal valued at $898 million.
The deal comes just months after Holland, Mich.-based First Michigan said it had been targeted by a different company. A First Michigan spokeswoman would not say who made the previous offer, or how it compared to the Huntington deal.
First Michigan shares fell 87.5 cents to $29.875 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon, after having jumped to as high as $30.75 in recent weeks on takeover speculation.
Under the definitive agreement, Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington Bancshares will offer 1.05 shares of its stock for each First Michigan share in a fixed exchange that is expected to be a tax-free pooling of interests.
The deal originally was valued at $31.50 per share or $908 million, based on Friday's closing stock price for Huntington. Huntington stock, however, fell 50 cents to $29.50 on Nasdaq on Monday, lowering the value of the deal.
""It's an expensive price here,"" said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. He noted that the deal valued First Michigan at 3.1 times book value and about 19 times 1996 earnings.
But First Michigan is also seen as a well-run franchise, in a western Michigan market that is attractive for its diverse economic base. Huntington is not currently in the western Michigan market, analysts noted.
""It's very pricey, but the point is I don't think anybody could have gotten First of Michigan without doing at least an at-market deal,"" said James Schutz, analyst at Chicago Corp.
All of First Michigan's 90 banking offices in the state will be merged into Huntington's lead subsidiary, Huntington National Bank. First Michigan has assets of $3.6 billion.
The combined company would have assets in excess of $25 billion, stockholders' equity of about $1.9 billion and a market capitalisation of about $5.2 billion.
""This merger significantly expands our Michigan market share and enables us to realise important synergies in our consumer, commercial and fee-based businesses,"" said Frank Wobst, chairman and chief executive of Huntington.
""Upon completion of this transaction, Huntington will have approximately $6 billion in assets in Michigan making it our second-largest market after Ohio.""
The acquisition is expected to boost Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington's earnings slightly in 1998 and increase profits by 4 percent in 1999, he said.
A pre-tax merger-related charge of about $35 million will be recognised in the quarter the merger is completed.
The merger is expected to result in annual cost savings of at least $19 million, or 15 percent of Michigan's expense base in 1998, by eliminating redundancy and excess capacity.
The deal is expected to close late in the third quarter, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Huntington has warrants to buy up to 19.9 percent of First Michigan's outstanding shares at an exercise price of $29.275 per share if the deal does not close under certain circumstances.
Huntington Bancshares, with assets in excess of $21 billion, operates 355 offices in Ohio, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and West Virginia. It also has 81 mortgage, trust, investment banking, and automobile finance offices in those states as well as in Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

DarrenSchuettler,"Shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd. soared on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday as rumors continued to swirl around the Busang gold deposit and analysts sifted through drill results from the site.
The Calgary, Alberta-based company's stock jumped C$1.22 to close at C$3.62 on massive turnover of 17 million shares on Canada's biggest stock market.
Frenzied late afternoon trading pushed the volatile stock to a session high of C$5.75.
Bre-X has been embroiled in controversy since preliminary tests by its partner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., on the gold property indicated the deposit may contain ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, from the company's stock market value.
Reports on Wednesday that Freeport recently received the first independent tests of the Busang deposit by a Canadian firm were challenged by Freeport and Bre-X officials.
The reports said Freeport received the tests while Freeport Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett was in Indonesia and held meetings with President Suharto.
""The testing is still going on and Freeport has not been informed of any assay results,"" Freeport spokeswoman Kristen Lemkau told Reuters by telephone.
Bre-X commissioned Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. last month to conduct an audit of its Busang project. The results are expected in early May.
""The audit was commissioned by Bre-X and it is going to be submitted to Bre-X,"" said Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool, adding that it was Bre-X that would release the audit results.
Bre-X late on Tuesday released drill results from 22 holes at the Busang property that were not included in its resource calculation of 70.95 million ounces of gold released on February 17.
Bre-X said 16 holes produced values ranging from 1.05 grams per tonne to 7.58 grams per tonne, while six holes showed no significant amount of gold.
""They were sort of old holes, but I think investors are taking it positively,"" said one mining analyst.
John Kaiser, editor of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, said the drill results released on Tuesday were positive, but not enough to quash the controversy surrounding Busang.
He said the final word on Busang was still up to two weeks away.
""We need to know what the numbers for this deposit run as produced by strictly controlled sampling, drilling and assaying procedures. Until we get a batch of results where we know that there is nothing screwy along the way, everything is uncertain,"" Kaiser said.
The Busang saga took another curious twist on Wednesday when an Indonesian company linked to President Suharto raised its stake in the Busang property.
Nusamba Group, 80 percent-owned by three foundations headed by President Suharto, raised its stake in the main Busang II section to 25 percent. Pt Askatindo Karya Minerals reduced its stake to five percent from 15 percent, said a spokesman for the family-owned company.
Bre-X has a 45 percent stake in Busang, Freeport has 15 percent and the Indonesian government 10 percent.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"Several days before a key report on the Busang gold controversy, a major partner confirmed on Thursday it had still not found significant gold at the site deep in the jungles of Indonesia.
Since it reported finding ""insignificant amounts"" of gold from preliminary tests of Busang last month, New Orleans-based Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. has continued testing its original seven drill cores taken from the site.
""We have continued analysis of those same cores and our previously announced findings are unchanged. We have not done any additional drilling beyond those core holes,"" Freeport spokesman Kristin Lemkau told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Freeport mentioned the continued testing of the drill cores in its first-quarter results released on Tuesday, but gave no further details.
""They are probably making sure that they have turned over every stone to just establish if there is gold or not. They also may be getting variances and they're trying to clear that up,"" a Canadian mining analyst said.
Freeport's announcement on March 26 prompted panic selling of shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd., which discovered the Busang site and heralded it as the century's biggest gold find.
Since losing almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion) of its stock market value last month, Bre-X shares have traded on the wildest of rumors while investors await an audit from Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd.
Bre-X stock slipped C2 cents to C$3.60 in heavy turnover of 10.3 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday.
The stock jumped to a high of C$5.75 on Wednesday amid incorrect rumors that Freeport Chief Executive Jim ""Bob"" Moffett resigned and that Freeport received preliminary results from Strathcona's audit of the Busang site.
The reports were quickly rejected by Bre-X and Freeport officials. Lemkau also declined comment on reports that Moffett was in Indonesia and had held meetings with President Suharto, saying that Freeport did not release the specific travel plans of its officials.
Analysts said Wednesday's rumors started on the Internet and quickly jolted Bre-X's stock out of its recent slumber.
""It amazes me that everyone is calling for higher forms of regulation and then everybody is relying on rumors and Internet chat lines. It's ridiculous,"" said John Ing, president of Toronto-based brokerage Maison Placements Canada.
Analysts expected more frenzied trading ahead of Freeport's annual shareholders meeting in New Orleans next Tuesday, April 29. Freeport has warned media that company officials would be reluctant to answer questions on the ""Bre-X matter"".
""Everybody is hoping that we'll have some information out around the Freeport annual meeting,"" another analyst said.
Some reports have suggested April 29 was also the date that Bre-X would receive Strathcona's report. But Bre-X has said it may not get the report until early May.
Whenever the Strathcona audit is released, analysts expect Freeport to follow quickly with a statement on its plans regarding the Busang project.
Meanwhile, officials with Barrick Gold Corp. and Placer Dome Inc. declined comment on reports that they were released from confidentiality agreements with Bre-X.
Some analysts have said Barrick and Placer -- once rival bidders for a share of the Busang site -- have information that could shed light on the mystery.
""We're not going to comment at all. All we can say is we would cooperate with any authorities investigating the matter,"" said Barrick spokesman Vince Borg.
The Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's top securities regulator, is probing Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws.
The OSC also declined comment on the report.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"The Busang gold mystery may be solved by late next week, Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. said on Friday, amid reports that its major partner may soon abandon the controversial project.
Bre-X said in a statement that Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., the consulting firm hired by Bre-X to audit its Busang project, expected to issue an interim report on its findings by the end of next week.
Rumors have swirled around Busang since the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) or 80 percent from the company's stock market value. Since then investors have anxiously awaited Strathcona's findings.
""Upon receiving and reviewing the interim report, Bre-X will be promptly issuing a press release relating to the interim report,"" Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh said.
Confusion over Bre-X's announcement on Friday sparked a brief bout of heavy selling on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Bre-X sank to a session low of C$2.50, but recovered to finish down C35 cents at C$3.25 on 8.9 million shares.
Freeport's annual meeting next week was also expected to draw intense media and investor attention, analysts said.
Citing unidentified sources, Indonesia's Harian Ekonomi Neraca newspaper on Friday said Freeport was planning to pull out of Busang before Strathcona's results were released.
""At best, this way Freeport can avoid any possible (legal) suit that may arise. And this (suit) is quite possible "" the anonymous source told Neraca.
Freeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Friday the firm had no comment beyond its earlier statements on participating in the Busang project.
""We're not going to comment. We will elect to participate only if the development is economically feasible,"" she said in a telephone interview.
Freeport's annual meeting is on Tuesday, April 29 in New Orleans.
Bre-X has a 45 percent stake in Busang, Freeport has 15 percent, the Indonesian government 10 percent and local companies the remaining 30 percent.
The Neraca report had little impact on Freeport's stock, which closed down 25 cents at $28.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. But some analysts said the report was interesting.
""My sense is there may be a kernel of truth in it,"" one U.S. mining analyst said of the Neraca report, noting other reports this week that Freeport Chief Executive Jim Moffett met with Indonesian President Suharto on a recent visit to Indonesia.
Freeport has not confirmed or denied these reports, saying it does not release specific travel plans of its officials.
The analyst also said that several days before Freeport's statement on March 26, Neraca cited unidentified sources as saying that Freeport did not get the same Busang results as Bre-X.
A Canadian analyst said Bre-X investors were divided into two camps heading into next week.
""One group thinks there is very little chance that the gold is anywhere near the amounts that Bre-X stated and the other group is firmly entrenched that this is all a grand conspiracy,"" the analyst said.
Meanwhile, Strathcona has promised tight security to prevent its findings from leaking out.
Assay labs in Indonesia, Canada and Australia will not report their results to Strathcona until all the labs have completed their work. Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory will have access to the final assays, Strathcona said.
The principal conclusions in the interim report are not expected to change when Strathcona releases its full report six weeks later.

DarrenSchuettler,"Canadians were stunned Sunday after a heartbreaking loss to the United States in the World Cup of Hockey dealt a crippling blow to the nation's pride.
Canada's ""dream team"" -- a galaxy of National Hockey League stars including Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier and Eric Lindros -- fell to an upstart American squad in a gripping finale to the World Cup championship Saturday.
Team USA, led by superb goaltending, defeated the Canadian squad 5-2 to win the best-of-three series in Montreal.
Canadians -- who consider hockey more of a religion than a sport -- mourned the country's worst loss in international play since 1981 when the Soviet Union handed Team Canada a crushing defeat in the Canada Cup -- the precursor to the World Cup.
Saturday night's loss has also rekindled fears of a further Americanisation of Canada's sacred game.
""I feel terrible, just terrible. That's why I'm here,"" Circiaco Deluca said as he quaffed a pint of beer in Wayne Gretzky's bar in Toronto, surrounded by mementos of past Canadian hockey glory.
Gretzky, known as the Great One, summed up the feelings of most of his countrymen after Saturday's game.
""This is a crushed locker room right now and probably a crushed country. It's devastating,"" Gretzky told reporters.
The disastrous outcome dominated the front pages of Canadian newspapers Sunday.
""DAMN YANKEES,"" screamed the Montreal Gazette newspaper.
""AMERICA'S GAME,"" cried the Toronto Star, Canada's largest newspaper.
""The U.S. roared into Canada like a mayhem-minded mob of Hell's Angels and left with a major chunk of our national heritage,"" wrote Star hockey columnist Damien Cox.
The tabloid Toronto Sun featured a cartoon of the Statue of Liberty with a hockey stick in one hand and the World Cup trophy in another.
Canada's defeat comes at a time when many fans are lamenting the steady Americanisation of their game.
Computer-enhanced pucks, flashy uniforms with cartoon characters, and the NHL's expansion into non-traditional markets like Phoenix and Nashville have made hockey purists cringe.
A Canadian-based team has not won the NHL's championship Stanley Cup since 1993 and appears likely to extend the losing streak for another year.
Small market clubs in Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa are struggling to stay alive in the face of skyrocketing costs. Quebec City and Winnipeg have already seen their franchises flee south to wealthier markets.
Frank Diponzio, a tourist from Rochester, N.Y., said hockey's future will depend on it growing in the bigger U.S. market.
""It's not as popular as baseball or football, but it's getting bigger. Beating Canada at home will help,"" he said in an interview.
Some Canadian fans were bitter that Canadian-born Brett Hull, the son of hockey legend Bobby Hull, scored twice in Saturday's game -- for the United States.
Hull, who has dual citizenship, played most of the game to chants of ""Brett Hull sucks"" from the partisan crowd in Montreal's Molson Centre.
""I think he should have played for Canada. It just shows a lack of respect for the country,"" said Trevor Murray, an 18-year-old student sporting a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater.
But others said the younger, faster U.S. team deserved credit for a gritty performance.
""It's not a national catastrophe. They played a great game and we'll be back,"" said Jack Porter of Sudbury, Ontario.

DarrenSchuettler,"U.S. mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. has extended its review of a controversial Indonesian gold mining project until June 30, Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. said Wednesday.
New Orleans-based Freeport, a partner in the Busang project in Indonesia, requested the extension ""to allow for consideration of the findings of the Strathcona audit,"" Bre-X said in a statement.
Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. is expected to deliver a key report on Busang to Bre-X on Thursday or Friday. Bre-X has said it will issue a press release on the report before North American financial markets open on Monday.
Rumours have swirled around Busang since what has been called the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when Freeport-McMoRan said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
Bre-X has estimated Busang contains about 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the largest in the world.
Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's stock market value last month, wiping out 80 percent of its market worth.
Freeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday the request for the extension was made within the past week.
""The original agreement with Bre-X signed on February 26 said that FCX's due diligence expired on April 30. This is really just to announce that we had pushed that date to June 30 to allow time for completion of the independent audit by Strathcona,"" Lemkau said in a telephone interview.
Lemkau declined to comment when asked if Freeport planned any further drilling at Busang over the next two months.
Bre-X shares led fell 32 cents Canadian (23 cents) to C$3.48 ($2.52) in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Some investors on an Internet chat page speculated that Freeport's extension was favourable to Bre-X, but mining analysts cautioned against reading too much into the announcement.
""I don't think we should read into the request, although obviously investors are,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.
""Everybody is reading a lot into the rumours. But really they are just rumours right now,"" another Canadian mining analyst said.
An Indonesian newspaper, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier this week that leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed ""cheerful"" grades of gold.
But in a report in the Calgary Sun newspaper on Wednesday, Strathcona President Graham Farquharson said it was unlikely that his company's findings had been leaked.
""I still haven't seen the results myself -- the assays are still under way. So I have to doubt the claim,"" Farquharson was quoted as saying by the Sun. ""To the best of my knowledge there've been no leaks,"" he said.
Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia.
Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory would have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished.
Strathcona has said its final report to Bre-X would be delivered about six weeks after an interim report.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Tuesday a key report on the Busang gold mystery will be released before North American financial markets open on Monday.
Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., the consulting firm hired by Bre-X to audit the project, is expected to issue an interim report on its findings to Bre-X by Friday.
""Bre-X expects to release the interim report next Monday morning prior to the opening of financial markets in North America,"" Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.
Wool said reports were wrong that Bre-X was preparing an elaborate press conference in Toronto for the announcement.
Rumors have swirled around Busang since the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) or 80 percent from the company's stock market value. Since then investors have anxiously awaited Strathcona's findings from Busang, once estimated by Bre-X to contain 71 million ounces of gold.
Bre-X closed up C15 cents at C$3.80 on 5.6 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
Freeport chief executive Jim Bob Moffett said on Tuesday the U.S. mining giant is hoping the Strathcona report will ""add more light"" to the Busang mystery.
""Freeport's participation is predicated on the fact that we will go forward and join only if we can confirm an economic deposit,"" Moffett said during the company's annual meeting.
The meeting was held under tight security at Freeport's New Orleans headquarters, where shareholders were screened by metal detectors and reporters were sequestered in a seperate room to view the proceedings on closed-circuit television.
While all eyes are on tiny Toronto-based Strathcona, some analysts said its report may only lead to further drilling at the Busang site.
""For anything definitive, one would expect a due diligence process that would take more than just six holes drilled by Strathcona and the seven holes (by Freeport). A lot more will have to be done before one has an idea of what is there and what isn't there,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.
Analysts were divided on whether the granting of Indonesian contracts of work (COW) to two companies related to Bre-X was a good omen for the embattled company.
Bre-X shares soared briefly on Monday after Bro-X Minerals Ltd and Bresea Resources Ltd signed contracts to develop two copper-gold projects.
The Indonesian government has put Bre-X's COW for Busang on hold until it completed a review of the company's drilling activities.
""I know a lot of people say its irrelevant, but I just can't believe that if the Indonesians felt there was a problem with Bre-X that they would have granted them (Bro-X and Bresea) contracts of work,"" said Norm Duncan, a broker with Vancouver-based C.M. Oliver and Co.
Analysts questioned the accuracy of an Indonesian newspaper report on Tuesday which said leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed ""cheerful"" grades of gold.
Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia.
Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory will have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished, Strathcona said last Friday.

DarrenSchuettler,"Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves said on Thursday the government was ahead of its revised deficit target for 1996/97 and may balance the province's books before the turn of the century.
In a pre-budget interview, Eves said he did not feel obligated to speed up the timetable for the next stage of the government's planned 30 percent income tax cut.
The Conservative government will deliver on May 6 its second full budget since sweeping to power in 1995.
Last February, Eves revised the 1996/97 deficit down to C$7.67 billion from an original forecast of C$8.2 billion.
""We might be slightly better than that. The economy performed pretty well,"" Eves said.
He declined to comment on economists' predictions that the 1996/97 deficit would drop below C$7 billion. Some analysts have speculated that the government could wipe out the deficit by fiscal 1999/2000, one year ahead of plan.
""It's not impossible, but it isn't a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination. There has to be some pretty significant growth,"" Eves said.  
In a pre-budget commentary on Wednesday, Toronto-Dominion Bank economists said Ontario could reach its deficit goal faster if the economy remained favorable.
Eves said it would be possible to balance the budget ahead of schedule if the economy grew around four percent annually for three straight years.
""If you had those types of growth numbers of around four (percent) or just under four (percent) for three consecutive years, I think it's possible that you could achieve that,"" he said.
But Eves said he would continue to use conservative economic forecasts in next week's budget.
""We would be more than happy to overachieve our targets and more than happy to get to our goal earlier than planned, but I'm not counting on it,"" he said.
Some economists have speculated that Ontario's stronger economy and improving deficit outlook might allow Eves to speed up delivering the next stage of a promised 30 percent tax cut.
About half the tax cut has been implemented, with the remaining 15 percent due by 1999.
""We said...we would provide half of the cut in our first budget and we did that. We (said) would provide for the next half over two years and I don't see any reason to change course,"" Eves said.
Since taking power in 1995 promising a ""Common Sense Revolution"", the Conservatives have outlined deep spending cuts through the end of the decade.
Eves said most of the cost-cutting had been put in place and Tuesday's budget would include spending on infrastructure and restructuring of public services.
""We always said -- in the the health care field especially -- that as we found savings and efficiencies, we would reinvest,"" he said.
Despite its deficit-cutting efforts, Ontario has not won a major rating upgrade from influential bond rating agencies.
""Sure you would like to see that recognition in the marketplace,"" Eves said, but he declined to comment when asked if Ontario deserved an upgrade.
""There have been a couple of upgrades in the Ontario's short-term ratings, but nothing substantial. Although we are borrowing money as if we had a better rating,"" Eves said.

DarrenSchuettler,"The Busang rumor mill continued to churn on Wednesday as a jittery market weighed Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc's move to extend its review of the controversial gold project.
Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Wednesday that Freeport was granted an extension for its due diligence review of the Busang project until June 30.
New Orleans-based Freeport, a partner in the Busang find, requested the extension ""to allow for consideration of the findings of the Strathcona audit,"" Bre-X said.
Rumors have swirled around Busang since the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partneb Freeport-McMoRan said its preliminary due diligence tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) or 80 percent from the company's stock market value last month.
Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd is expected to deliver a key report on Busang to Bre-X on Thursday or Friday. Bre-X has said it will issue a press release on the report before North American financial markets open on Monday.
Freeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday the request for the extension was made within the past week.
""The original agreement with Bre-X signed on February 26 said that FCX's due diligence expire on April 30. This is really just to announce that we had pushed that date to June 30 to allow time for completion of the independent audit by Strathcona,"" Lemkau said in a telephone interview.
Strathcona has said its final report to Bre-X would be delivered about six weeks after the interim report. Strathcona has said the principal conclusions in the interim report are not expected to differ from the final report.
Lemkau declined to comment when asked if Freeport planned any further drilling at Busang over the next two months.
Bre-X shares led heavy traders on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday, closing down C32 (US23) cents at C$3.48 ($2.52) on 9.7 million shares.
Some investors on an Internet chat page speculated on Wednesday that Freeport's extension was favorable to Bre-X. But mining analysts cautioned against reading too much into the announcement.
""I don't think we should read into the request, although obviously investors are,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.

"
DarrenSchuettler,"Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. said on Friday it expected to receive a key report this weekend that may show just how much gold is in the controversial Busang find in Indonesia.
While the Calgary-based gold prospector said it still hoped to release the report's findings on Monday, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) on Friday braced for the frenzied trading in Bre-X shares expected when the report is made public.
""We expect the report from Strathcona this weekend. We're not guaranteed that we are going to get, but we expect it,"" Bre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty said in an interview on Friday.
Bre-X hired consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. to review its Busang project after doubts emerged in March over what has been called the gold find of the century in March.
Busang partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said on March 26 its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
Bre-X has estimated the site contains about 71 million ounces of gold.
After Freeport's announcement, panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's stock market value.
McAnulty said Bre-X's plan to issue a news release on the report before North American financial markets opened on Monday will depend on when the company gets the report.
""As far as having something out on Monday, if we get the report in time and we're able to that, absolutely. But it's all dependent on when we get the report,"" McAnulty said.
While the mining world awaits Strathcona's findings, anxious investors on Friday placed their final bets on whether the Indonesian gold discovery is a bonanza or a bust.
""It all comes down to do they have the gold or don't they? And if so, how much? That basically are the two questions that have to be answered,"" said Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with Toronto-based borkerage RBC Dominion Securities.
Bre-X stock closed up 19 cents Canadian (14 cents) at C$3.23 ($2.34) in heavy turnover of 9.25 million shares on the TSE.
Analysts said the last flurry of trading before Monday's expected announcement was driven purely by rumors. ""Some investors are saying let's go to Las Vegas without taking a plane. That in essence is what they're doing,"" Katzin said.
Meanwhile, the TSE set special trading rules for Bre-X shares to handle the huge volumes expected next week.
Frantic trading in the days after Freeport's announcement in March overwhelmed the TSE's computer trading system, forcing embarrassed officials to shutdown the system on several occasions.
A typical active TSE stock trades up to 300 orders per day, but the highest daily order for Bre-X so far has been 5,300 orders.
To avoid another system meltdown, the TSE said on Friday brokers can only accept and enter day orders with no special terms. A day order is an order that is only valid for one trading day.
Also, orders entered by brokers that are well outside the quoted market may be canceled.
The TSE said the modified rules were necessary ""in anticipation of what could be an unprecedented number of orders following release of the ... interim report.""
"
DarrenSchuettler,"Canada's Barrick Gold Corp, the world's second largest gold producer, said on Thursday Indonesia and Canada's mining sectors are innocent casualties of the Busang gold controversy.
Peter Munk, chairman of Barrick and a former bidder for Busang, said the saga of Bre-X Minerals Ltd and its Indonesian gold project has tarnished the reputations of both countries among foreign investors.
""This Busang affair. The Bre-X affair. Now more a soap opera belonging to the movies than to the boardrooms, has created an awful lot of backlash,"" Munk told the company's annual meeting in Toronto after returning to Canada from a recent business trip to Europe.
But Munk said the success of other Canadian mining companies should not be tarred by controversy swirling around one junior gold prospector.
""Our mining industry is second to none,"" Munk said. ""And no single rogue operation and no single deviant member can change these fundamentals.""
Later speaking to reporters, Munk said his ""rogue"" comment did not imply that he believed there was no gold at Busang.
Rumors have swirled around Busang since what has been called the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said its preliminary due diligence tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
Bre-X, the discoverer of Busang, has estimated the site contains about 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the largest in the world.
After Freeport's announcement last month, panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's stock market value, wiping out 80 percent of its market worth. Shares in other Canadian gold miners plummeted as well.
Bre-X shares have continued to trade furiously as anxious investors await a key report due on Monday which may clear up the Busang mystery.
Bre-X has hired an independent consultant, Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd, to review the Busang project.
The stock closed down C44 (US32) cents at C$3.04 ($2.20) in heavy turnover of 7.1 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Munk, who lost a battle for control of the Busang site earlier this year, said he still had faith in Indonesia and its mining laws.
Let me tell you...that what happened in this fiasco, what happened in the publicity field is not the fault of Indonesia or Indonesian laws,"" he said.
Munk said Indonesia's economy is booming and Barrick will continue to seek gold projects in the country. He noted other major international firms, including Canadian nickel giant Inco Ltd, have operated in Indonesia for years ""within the law and protected by the law.""
Last year, Bre-X was the target of an intense bidding war as several heavyweight mining firms battled for control of the gold discovery deep in the jungles of Borneo.
Barrick initially dominated the negotiations, but it lost the inside track when President Suharto's government brought in Indonesian businessman Muhammad ""Bob"" Hasan in January.
Hasan swiftly brokered a deal giving New Orleans-based Freeport McMoRan 15 percent of Busang and the right to mine the project. The arrangement left Bre-X with 45 percent, down from an original 90 percent stake, and the rest to the Indonesian government and two Indonesian companies.
Munk said before Busang he had never expended more energy in pursuing an acquisition. But he lost interest in Busang when it became clear that Barrick could not get complete control of the project, a condition it considers critical for all its mining operations.
""You would not want us to have a billion or a billion and a half dollars in Indonesia or anywhere else -- outside of our control,"" Munk told shareholders.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"As mining officials the world over await test results that may solve the puzzle of an Indonesian gold deposit, reports Sunday suggested the news may be bad for Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its controversial Busang find.
Calgary-based Bre-X is expected to release the long-awaited study by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. before North American markets open on Monday.
But Bre-X officials on Sunday declined to comment on a report that the company will urge more tests to determine just how much gold is at Busang.
""Bre-X will argue that what's now needed is a large bulk sample from the Busang site for further testing,"" the Toronto Star newspaper quoted an unnamed Bre-X insider as saying.
""Any mining company in our position would want further testing,"" the source was quoted as saying.
A bulk sample would involve more extensive drilling, sampling and assaying of the site. Strathcona's report is based on samples from six holes drilled at Busang.
Some observers said talk of a bulk sample suggested the Strathcona report was negative for Bre-X, which has estimated Busang contains 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the richest site in the world.
""If the rumor is (Bre-X) needs a bulk sample, then that's because the small amount of sampling that has been done is disappointing,"" George Duncan, president of mining consultant Acurrassay Laboratories, said by telephone Sunday.
Duncan said Strathcona President Graham Farquharson is well regarded within the mining community and has a reputation for being conservative in his findings.
""Somebody once said he is a mine buster,"" Duncan said.
Bre-X hired Strathcona to review the project in March after doubts emerged over what has been called the gold find of the century.
Busang partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said on March 26 that its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
That same day, Strathcona told Bre-X the gold at Busang may have been overstated due to invalid procedures.
The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion U.S.) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11).
Other analysts predicted the final word on Busang will only come after further drilling.
""This deposit is going to have to be drilled off,"" John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada, said Sunday.
""My guess is that there is gold there, but what really made this deposit was the size and the higher grade. Presumably, the higher grade is not there,"" he said.
With billions of dollars in limbo, nervous shareholders have traded rumors for weeks on Internet chat sites.
Bre-X's stock closed up 19 cents (14 cents) at C$3.23 ($2.34) on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday.
The TSE has set special trading rules for Bre-X shares on Monday to handle the huge volumes expected when the Strathcona report is released. Frantic trading after Freeport's announcement in March overwhelmed the TSE's computer trading system.
The Strathcona report will be closely watched by some shareholders who have launched class-action lawsuits against Bre-X and some of its key officials.
The suits charge that Bre-X executives gave inflated projections about the size of Busang's gold deposits so they could pump up the stock and sell it off for big profits.
The Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's top securities regulator, is currently probing Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws.
Foreign investors are also monitoring the outcome of the Bre-X affair, which has tarnished Canada's reputation within the world mining community. Other major mining countries, particularly Australia, have criticized Canada for its lax regulation of smaller mining companies.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"The big U.S. mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. pulled out of the now worthless Busang gold project on Monday as Canada's mining community reeled from the biggest fraud in mining history.
New Orleans-based Freeport said a damning independent report on Busang released by Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. late on Sunday confirmed its own poor test results from the site.
""Consequently, (Freeport) will notify Bre-X that it is withdrawing from the Busang project pursuant to the terms of its contractual agreement,"" the company said in a statement.
The Busang discovery  -- touted by Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining"" according to the report by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd.
Strathcona said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X's core samples and that Strathcona's own tests discovered only trace amounts of gold at the Busang site where Bre-X claimed to have found 71 million ounces of gold.
The report said a gold deposit worth mining was unlikely to be found at the site.
""We are very disappointed that the apparent opportunity for (Freeport) to develop the Busang property has been eliminated by (our) findings ... as now confirmed by the Strathcona audit report,"" said Freeport Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett.
In Jakarta, an Indonesian company linked to President Suharto said it also was withdrawing from the Busang project. Nusamba Group, chaired by businessman Muhammad ""Bob"" Hasan, is 80 percent-owned by three charities headed by Suharto and 10 percent each by Hasan and Suharto's eldest son.
In a separate statement, Bre-X's chief of exploration, John Felderhof, said he was shocked and dismayed by the Strathcona report.
""I know that I was not involved in a fraud. I also find it very hard to believe that anyone on my staff was involved in a fraud,"" Felderhof said in a statement faxed from the Cayman Islands late on Sunday.
Felderhof's Busang staff included Michael de Guzman, a Bre-X geologist who allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter on March 19 while en route to a meeting with Freeport officials in Indonesia.
On March 26, Freeport said that its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
After the Freeport announcement, Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona, a well-respected Canadian mining consulting firm, to review its Busang project.
The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11).
Bre-X's stock was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday after Sunday's stunning report. But shares in other small Canadian mining companies tumbled as the Bre-X scandal reverberated through the mining community.
Barry Allen, a mining analyst at Gordon Capital in Toronto, said investors would be very sceptical of future unproven discoveries by Canadian prospectors.
""Everyone will go back and re-value and re-look at everything, starting from the ground up,"" Allen said.
Freeport and Bre-X agreed to develop the Busang site in January after an intense bidding war by several big mining companies for control of the project.
In a deal brokered by Indonesian businessman Hasan, Freeport received a 15 percent stake and the right to mine the project. The arrangement left Bre-X with 45 percent, down from an original 90 percent stake, and the rest with the Indonesian government and the Indonesian companies.
Meanwhile, the mystery of what happened remains.
The reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman. The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin, which has already said it was not responsible for sampling.
""I personally still believe that there are significant amounts of gold at Busang,"" Felderhof said in his statement, adding he would cooperate with authorities investigating the case.
Disgruntled shareholders have already launched at least eight class-action lawsuits against Bre-X and the Ontario Securities Commission is investigating Bre-X for possible violations of trading and disclosure laws.
Several books are being written about the Bre-X saga and a movie is being planned.

Bre-X has hired accounting firm Price Waterhouse, Forensic Investigative Associates and other advisers to find out how the data could have been falsified.
""Investigators will get to the bottom of this,"" Walsh told reporters before entering the company's headquarters in Calgary on Monday. He had no further comment.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said investigators from its commercial crime unit are studying the Strathcona report.
""Bre-X has given us a copy of the report and our investigators are reviewing that (report),"" RCMP spokeswoman Deleen Schoff said in a telephone interview.
""I can't speculate on what they're going to do after they read the report,"" Schoff said.

Freeport and Bre-X agreed to develop the Busang site in January after an intense bidding war by several big mining companies for control of the project.
The Bre-X fiasco has tarnished Canada's mining reputation at home and abroad. But Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said it should not be judged by the actions of one company.
""There might have been a bad situation in the case of Bre-X ... but the Canadian mining sector is considered the most capable and most competent in the world,"" Chretien said on Monday while campaigning during Canada's federal election.
Bre-X's stock was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday, but shares in other small Canadian miners tumbled as the Bre-X scandal reverberated through the mining community.
""I would say this year is largely a writeoff in terms of an overall junior resource bull market,"" said John Kaiser, editor of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, a mining newsletter.
Meanwhile, the mystery of what happened remained.
The reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman. The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin, which has already said it was not responsible for sampling.
""I personally still believe that there are significant amounts of gold at Busang,"" Felderhof said in his statement.
Disgruntled shareholders have launched at least eight class-action lawsuits against Bre-X and the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) said on Monday it would continue probing Bre-X for possible violations of trading and disclosure laws.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"David Walsh, the maverick Canadian embroiled in world's biggest gold fiasco, always dreamed of striking it rich.
Under siege since doubts about Busang deposit surfaced in late March, Walsh had dismissed the conspiracy and tampering theories that have dogged his company Bre-X Minerals Ltd. -- until now.
""We share the shock and dismay our of shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there,"" Walsh said after his company released a devastating report on Busang on Sunday.
In an interim report to Bre-X, consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said the company's data on Busang was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world.""
It is a stunning conclusion to a mystery that has gripped the world mining community in recent months.
Walsh, 51, has made millions of dollars and appeared on the covers of national magazines since his Calgary, Alberta -based exploration company announced its 1993 Busang gold discovery in Indonesia.
""I'm nuts. I'm looking for the bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow,"" the beefy stock promoter, who lives in the Bahamas, told a Canadian magazine earlier this year.
Veteran Calgary journalist Jim Bentein, who covered Bre-X since its early days on the Alberta Stock Exchange, has described Walsh as ""a sophisticated trucker,"" who is as comfortable having a beer and a smoke in a bar as he is in financial circles.
After the Strathcona report, some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the turmoil now blamed Walsh.
""He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law,"" Chris Laughren, a  construction worker, told Reuters on Sunday as he waited anxiously outside Bre-X's headquarters in Calgary.
Laughren said he has lost C$7,500 ($5,400) on Bre-X stock, or ""three months work down the drain.""
Walsh said on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X's assets ""for the benefit of the shareholders.""
Raised in a wealthy suburb of Montreal, Walsh followed his father and grandfather into the stock business.
He joined a small trust company shortly after graduating from high school. In 1976 he moved to brokerage Midland Doherty Ltd. (now Midland Walwyn Capital Inc.) and rose to vice president in its institutional equity sales department.
In the 1980s Midland moved Walsh to Calgary, but he left the company shortly afterward to set up his own company, Bresea Resources Ltd.
After dabbling unsuccessfully in oil and gas, Walsh created Bre-X Minerals Ltd. in 1989 and ventured into mining. But by 1993 his exploration efforts had dried up.
He and his wife declared bankruptcy in 1993 after accumulating almost C$60,000 ($43,800) in debt on 15 credit cards.
""We had these claims which were worthless, and no money,"" Walsh said in an interview earlier this year.
Almost broke, he scraped together C$10,000 ($7,300) to start exploring in Indonesia, pursuading friends to invest C$200,000 ($146,000) for a stake in the area now known as the central Busang in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province.
Walsh hit the jackpot with Busang, and Bre-X quickly became the darling of the world's mining community.
""There's nothing like success. Our other explorations have been zero. I had never imagined it would be this big,"" he said.
Walsh, his wife and other company officials added more than C$37 million ($27 million) to their bank accounts after they sold Bre-X stock at prices ranging from C$24.40 ($17.81) to C$28.40 ($20.73) between August and October 1996.
But the sales were controversial because they occurred shortly after Bre-X learned its preliminary license had been canceled by the Indonesian government, a development the company did not reveal publicly until October 1996.
As the fallout from Sunday's announcement reverberated through the world mining community, Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X's Calgary headquarters.
""I think our press release says it all for now,"" he said.

DarrenSchuettler,"The Busang gold discovery in Indonesia -- touted by Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining"" according to a report released on Sunday.
In a stunning report to Bre-X, consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X core samples taken from the Busang site, located deep in the jungles of Borneo.
""The magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we believe has occurred and resulting falsification of assay values at Busang, is of a scale and over a period of time and with a precision that, to our knowledge, is without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world,"" the report said.
Strathcona said it did not find an economic gold deposit in the southeast zone of the Busang property, the area claimed by Bre-X to contain about 71 million ounces of gold. The report said an economic deposit was unlikely.
The Toronto Stock Exchange said on Sunday that it would halt trading in Bre-X shares on Monday ""in light of the extremely negative report from Strathcona.""
Bre-X's stock closed up 19 cents (14 cents) at C$3.23 ($2.34) on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday.
Bre-X chairman David Walsh, the maverick mining executive who gambled his last C$10,000 ($7,200) on finding Busang, said the company was ""devastated"" by Strathcona's findings.
""We share the shock and dismay of our shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there,"" Walsh said in a statement on Sunday.
As the fallout from Sunday's announcement reverberated through the world mining community, Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X's Calgary headquarters where shareholders and reporters had gathered.
""I think our press release says it all for now,"" he said.
The report spells the end of Bre-X, said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements Canada in Toronto.
""Bre-X has got nothing, that's what it means,"" Ing said in a telephone interview. ""They've got nothing but lawsuits on their hands,"" he said.
With billions of dollars in limbo, nervous shareholders have traded rumors for weeks on Internet chat sites while they waited for the Strathcona report.
Some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the recent turmoil now lay the blame at Walsh's feet.
""He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law,"" Chris Laughren, a  construction worker, told Reuters on Sunday as he waited outside Bre-X's headquarters.
Laughren said he has lost C$7,500 ($5,400) on Bre-X stock, or ""three months work down the drain.""
Walsh said in a statement on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X's remaining assets ""for the benefit of the shareholders.""
A penny-stock exploration firm before it discovered Busang in 1993, Bre-X quickly became the darling of the Toronto Stock Exchange amid glowing reports of Busang's potential.
But rumors began swirling around Bre-X and its Busang deposit after the March 19 apparent suicide of Bre-X's top geologist in Indonesia.
Michael de Guzman allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter while en route to a meeting with officials at Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc, one of Bre-X's partners in the Busang project.
A week later on March 26, New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan said that its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
The reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Bre-X's head of exploration John Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman. The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin, a unit of Montreal-based SNC Lavalin Inc. Kilborn has already said it was not responsible for sampling.
After the Freeport-McMoRan report Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona, a well-respected Canadian mining consulting firm, to review its Busang project.
The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion U.S.) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11).
A Freeport spokesman said on Sunday the company had no immediate comment, but would release a statement before North American financial markets opened on Monday.
""Our response is we're aware Bre-X has released a news release,"" spokesman Garland Robinette said.
Freeport said last month it would ""elect to participate in the Busang project only if development is, in (Freeport's) opinion, economically feasible.""
Disgruntled shareholders have already launched at least eight class action lawsuits.
The Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's top securities regulator, is investigating Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws.
Increasing attention is being paid to personal trades by Walsh, his wife and other company officials in 1996, which netted them about C$77 million ($55 million).
Less than a year ago, Bre-X was the target of an intense bidding war as several heavyweight mining firms battled for control of possibly the world's richest gold discovery.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"David Walsh, the maverick Canadian embroiled in the world's biggest gold fiasco, always dreamed of striking it rich.
Under siege since doubts about Busang deposit surfaced in late March, Walsh had dismissed the conspiracy and tampering theories that have dogged his company Bre-X Minerals Ltd. -- until now.
""We share the shock and dismay our of shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there,"" Walsh said after his company released a devastating report on Busang on Sunday.
In an interim report to Bre-X, consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said the company's data on Busang was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world.""
It is a stunning conclusion to a mystery that has gripped the world mining community in recent months.
Walsh, 51, has made millions of dollars and appeared on the covers of national magazines since his Calgary, Alberta -based exploration company announced its 1993 Busang gold discovery in Indonesia.
""I'm nuts. I'm looking for the bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow,"" the beefy stock promoter, who lives in the Bahamas, told a Canadian magazine earlier this year.
Veteran Calgary journalist Jim Bentein, who covered Bre-X since its early days on the Alberta Stock Exchange, has described Walsh as ""a sophisticated trucker,"" who is as comfortable having a beer and a smoke in a bar as he is in financial circles.
After the Strathcona report, some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the turmoil now blamed Walsh.
""He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law,"" Chris Laughren, a  construction worker, told Reuters on Sunday as he waited anxiously outside Bre-X's headquarters in Calgary.
Laughren said he has lost C$7,500 ($5,400) on Bre-X stock, or ""three months work down the drain.""
Walsh said on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X's assets ""for the benefit of the shareholders.""
Raised in a wealthy suburb of Montreal, Walsh followed his father and grandfather into the stock business.
He joined a small trust company shortly after graduating from high school. In 1976 he moved to brokerage Midland Doherty Ltd. (now Midland Walwyn Capital Inc.) and rose to vice president in its institutional equity sales department.
In the 1980s Midland moved Walsh to Calgary, but he left the company shortly afterward to set up his own company, Bresea Resources Ltd.
After dabbling unsuccessfully in oil and gas, Walsh created Bre-X Minerals Ltd. in 1989 and ventured into mining. But by 1993 his exploration efforts had dried up.
He and his wife declared bankruptcy in 1993 after accumulating almost C$60,000 ($43,800) in debt on 15 credit cards.
""We had these claims which were worthless, and no money,"" Walsh said in an interview earlier this year.
Almost broke, he scraped together C$10,000 ($7,300) to start exploring in Indonesia, pursuading friends to invest C$200,000 ($146,000) for a stake in the area now known as the central Busang in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province.
Walsh hit the jackpot with Busang, and Bre-X quickly became the darling of the world's mining community.
""There's nothing like success. Our other explorations have been zero. I had never imagined it would be this big,"" he said.
Walsh, his wife and other company officials added more than C$37 million ($27 million) to their bank accounts after they sold Bre-X stock at prices ranging from C$24.40 ($17.81) to C$28.40 ($20.73) between August and October 1996.
But the sales were controversial because they occurred shortly after Bre-X learned its preliminary license had been cancelled by the Indonesian government, a development the company did not reveal publicly until October 1996.
As the fallout from Sunday's announcement reverberated through the world mining community, Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X's Calgary headquarters.
""I think our press release says it all for now,"" he said.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"The saga of Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its now-worthless Busang gold find adds another chapter to a Canadian mining history rich in wealth and fiascos.
Canada has seen its share of scandals over the years -- from the 1960s Windfall affair to recent smaller busts -- but Bre-X is the most devastating to date.
The Busang discovery  -- touted by Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining,"" said a report by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., released by Bre-X late Sunday.
""I think it's one of those things like Windfall. People will talk about it for years,"" veteran mine promoter Patrick Sheridan said in a recent interview.
Until now, Canada's biggest national mining scandal was the Windfall Oils and Mines Ltd. affair in the 1960s.
During a copper and zinc rush in northern Ontario, mining promoters George and Viola MacMillan acquired claims rumored to have tremendous potential.
Fueled by rumors, Windfall's stock soared to more than C$5 ($3.60) from pennies in less than a month. Authorities pressured the MacMillans to release their drilling results.
The results showed the grand deposit as a dud. The stock collapsed, and Canada's government launched a royal commission to investigate.
The Kelly Commission found no evidence the MacMillans, who carted the drill samples around in their Cadillac, were the source of the rumors. But their actions promoted a belief by investors that the samples were valuable, the commission said.
Viola MacMillan went to jail briefly for stock manipulation.
Sheridan said the panel came up with a good report on how another Windfall could be avoided. But, like many government reports, it was shelved.
The earliest dashed mining hope in Canada was in 1575 when English explorer Martin Frobisher found what he believed to be gold on Baffin Island in the far north.
When he returned to England with 1,500 tons of ore, the royal assayer told Frobisher he had worthless iron pyrites, also known as ""fool's gold.""
More recent mining embarassments involved Timbuktu Gold Corp. and Cartaway Resources Corp.
Last year, Timbuktu stock soared on a reported gold find in West Africa. But a new management team revealed the assays had been salted, or doctored, by unknown parties.
When investors got the news, the stock plunged around C$23 ($16) to C$1.75 ($1.27).
Cartaway stock skyrocketed in April 1996 after it announced a copper-nickel find in Labrador, Newfoundland.
The news came amid the fever over the huge Voisey's Bay nickel and copper find, which Canadian nickel giant Inco Ltd. acquired for C$4.3 billion ($3.1 billion).
Cartaway's report, however, was based on a visual inspection of just one core sample by a geologist at the site. The stock sank more than C$20 ($14) to about C$2.80 ($2).
Rich deals such as Inco's takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp.'s $800 million acquisition of Arequipa Resources Ltd. fueled investor enthusiasm for mining plays. But analysts said it also might have impaired the market's judgment.
""It's a symptom of the times. There is a high degree of greed in the markets, not only in the mining industry but with regard to others, and investors tend to get complacent during these times,"" said John Ing, president of brokerage Maison Placements Canada in Toronto.
Another Canadian mining scandal eerily similar to Bre-X involved New Cinch Uranium Ltd. and its New Mexico gold find in the 1980s.
Willroy Mines Ltd. bid for New Cinch after its stock rallied on rich assays performed by a U.S.-based lab, Chem-Tec.
But rumors about poor test results by another assayer sent the stock on a wild ride. The mob-style murder of a former Chem-Tec employee added to the intrigue.
After a negative independent audit, New Cinch admitted the samples were contaminated and several lawsuits ensued. Willroy pulled out of the project.
Today, investigators are probing the Bre-X embroglio as Canada's mining community tries to repair its tarnished image at home and abroad.
Some said the past success of Canada's other mining companies should not be tarred by controversy about one small miner.
""Our mining industry is second to none,"" Peter Munk, chairman of Barrick, the world's second biggest gold miner, said recently. ""And no single rogue operation and no single deviant member can change these fundamentals.""
"
DarrenSchuettler,"While Bre-X Minerals Ltd's maverick chief executive and senior geologist were crowned Canada's top prospectors in March, a major Busang partner got its first inkling that the gold find of century was bust.
The big U.S. mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc pulled out of the now worthless Busang gold project on Monday after a damning consultant's report concluded Busang was the biggest fraud in mining history.
New Orleans-based Freeport said the report confirmed its own poor test results from the site.
Freeport chief executive Jim Bob Moffett said on Monday the first sign that something was wrong at Busang came when its assay lab -- PT Indo Assay Laboratories in Balikpapan, Indonesia -- could not find significant amounts of gold in Freeport's samples.
""We had a preliminary indication from the Indo Assay labs that the samples were not checking out,"" Moffett said in a conference call with reporters on Monday.
Moffett said he tried to contact Bre-X Minerals Chief Executive David Walsh and the company's Chief of Exploration, John Felderhof. Both were in Toronto in mid-March to receive awards from their peers at a gala ceremony hosted by the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada.
Bre-X's chief geologist, Michael de Guzman, also attended the conference in Toronto.
The Busang discovery  -- touted by Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining,"" according to a report issued late on Sunday by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd.
""I notified them that they needed to get some senior people back out (to Indonesia) because we needed some help to try to understand what was going on,"" Moffett said.
De Guzman was en route to a meeting with Freeport officials in Borneo on March 19 when he allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter. Rumors began to swirl around the Busang project after de Guzman's death.
""Mr. de Guzman was aware that there were problems with the assays. I don't know how much detail he was told,"" Moffett said.
About a week after de Guzman's death as rumors about Freeport's findings pounded Bre-X's stock, the Toronto Stock Exchange asked Freeport to issue a statement.
Freeport stunned investors on March 26 when the company said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona to audit the project.
The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares on March 27, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11).
In its report, Strathcona said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X's core samples and that Strathcona's own tests discovered only trace amounts of gold at the Busang site where Bre-X claimed to have found 71 million ounces of gold.
The report said a gold deposit worth mining was unlikely to be found at the site.
Moffett said Bre-X's warehouse near the Borneo town of Samarinda was the most likely spot for any tampering of Bre-X's core samples.
""We felt that way because those samples sat there for such a long period of time before they actually went to lab in Balikpapan,"" Moffett said.
""It appeared to us that the samples that went to Samarinda ended up with gold in them. The ones that didn't go to Samarinda ended up with no gold in them,"" he said.
Moffett said the theory about tampering at Samarinda is outlined in the full interim Strathcona report which will be released publicly on Tuesday.
He said it is up to authorities to discover who exactly tampered with Bre-X's samples.
Despite the fallout from the Busang debacle, Moffett said prospects for mining investment remain strong in Indonesia, where it has major operations.
""I have a lot of confidence that there is going to be other gold and copper found in the Pacific Rim, especially in the rest of Indonesia and into the Phillippines,"" he said.
"
DarrenSchuettler,"A key consultant's report on Tuesday shed more light on how tampering occurred at the worthless Busang gold project in Indonesia, once touted by Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as the strike of the century.
While shareholders bailed out of the former stock market darling on Tuesday, investigators and analysts were trying to figure out how the country's biggest swindle could have happened.
Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., the firm hired by Bre-X that delivered a devastating audit of Busang on Sunday, gave some clues in its full interim report released on Tuesday.
Strathcona said its experts initially found it hard to believe that tampering could have happened on such a grand scale. Bre-X's last resource estimate of 71 million ounces of gold at Busang was based on data pulled from 16,400 samples.
But after a month-long study, Strathcona said ""there appears to be little alternative but to conclude that virtually all the gold in the samples submitted by Bre-X for assaying has originated from some other source.""
Bre-X's storage warehouse near the Borneo town of Samarinda, where core samples were kept for a lengthy period of time, was the most likely spot for any tampering, the report said.
Under Bre-X's system, the core samples from the Busang site were shipped by boat to Samarinda and then trucked to Balikpapan for assaying. The samples spent several weeks at Samarinda before they were sent to Indo Assay Laboratories in Balikpapan.
Strathcona said the precision of tampering was impressive. It suggested those involved had detailed knowledge of the region and how to add the right amounts of gold to match the site's geology.
""We can only suggest that somewhere enroute, probably at Samarinda, there has been a laboratory or facilities established that have allowed very precise additions of the foreign gold,"" the report said.
The report also revealed that Bre-X officials had studies last November that showed serious abnormalities in its Busang gold find.
During its audit, Strathcona reviewed a feasibility review by Kilborn SNC-Lavalin Inc. and a metallurgical study performed by Australia's Normet Pty Ltd. Both studies were commissioned by Bre-X.
Strathcona said it was ""struck by"" Normet's statement that more than 90 percent of the gold in Bre-X's Busang samples were consistent with alluvial, or river, gold. Busang is considered a bedrock deposit.
Before Sunday's devastating news, Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh had dismissed doubts about Busang that had dogged his company since March. He said he was shocked by Strathcona's report and vowed to find the culprits.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has investigators from its commercial crime unit studying the Strathcona report, but no formal probe had been launched, it said.
Rumours about Busang surfaced in March when Busang chief geologist Michael de Guzman allegedly jumped it to his death from a helicopter while flying to a meeting with Bre-X partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., a big mining company based in New Orleans.
Freeport had summoned de Guzman to explain why Bre-X's estimates of 71 million ounces of gold at Busang did not match Freeport's findings.
About a week after de Guzman's death, as rumours about Freeport's findings pounded Bre-X's stock, the Toronto Stock Exchange asked Freeport to issue a statement.
Freeport stunned investors on March 26 when the company said its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold. Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona to audit the project.
The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares on March 27, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's market value in one day.
Freeport and an Indonesian company said on Monday they planned to pull out of the Busang project.
Bre-X's stock plunged C$3.17 to C6 cents in frenzied action after it resumed trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) on Tuesday. Bre-X's stock value had once topped C$6 billion ($4.4 billion).
""Investors are very disenchanted. Very disappointed and they're selling it just to get it off their backs,"" Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities, said on Tuesday.
The legal fallout from the Busang bust continued on Tuesday with another class action suit filed against Bre-X Minerals, raising the number of suits against Bre-X to at least nine.
New York law firm Wechsler Harwood Halebian &amp; Feffer LLP said it was seeking to recover damages for shareholders hurt by the Bre-X selloff.
"
DavidLawder,"Chrysler Corp Vice Chairman Robert Lutz, who recently throttled back on his corporate responsibilities, said Tuesday he still sees himself as an integral part of Chrysler's product creation activities.
""I don't see that anything changed,"" Lutz told Reuters in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show. As of January 1, Lutz gave up his president and chief operating officer titles to become vice chairman in anticipation of his 65th birthday in February.  
Although Lutz is largely credited with turning around Chrysler's product development operations by instituting a system of super-efficient ""platform teams"" to bring each new vehicle to market, he said he rarely gives orders to subordinates.
He said he will continue to act as a coach and mentor for the engineers and product executives responsible for new products.
Lutz said he and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton ""are really more cheerleaders and coaches rather than the captain of the team that's out on the field actually playing.  
Eaton took over Lutz's chief operating officer duties and now has several executive vice presidents reporting directly to him.
Lutz said the new structure will give Eaton a chance to work more closely with the executive vice presidents, which will ease the transition to the next generation of leadership. He declined to comment on which executive vice presidents -- who include product development chief Thomas Gale, international chief Francois Castaing and sales and marketing chief James Holden -- have the best shot at succeeding the 57-year-old Eaton as the company's next chief executive.  
Lutz said he will probably stay at Chrysler for at most two ""I have to use to use this transitional period to ease myself out gradually, because the harsh reality is that I cannot stay around until I'm 70,"" he said. ""I would be seriously worried about a company that had its product fortunes guided by a 70-year-old guy. That usually results in cars directed at 70-year-olds.""
Lutz said he will probably become less involved in Chrysler's manufacturing operations, but will probably spend more time visiting Chrysler's international operations, an area in which he has more expertise.
"
DavidLawder,"Chrysler Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Eaton said Tuesday that the automaker will report record earnings for the full 1996 year, based on record worldwide sales of 2.97 million vehicles.
""We're going to have a record year,"" Eaton told Reuters in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show.  
Chrysler's previous annual profit record came in 1994, when the company earned $3.713 billion. It earned $2.025 billion in 1995, when sales were held to 2.61 million units by the launch of its current line of minivans.
Eaton also said Chrysler in 1997 should be able to exceed its 1996 sales results because the company will be able to produce about 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than it built in 1996.  
The increase will be made up of added capacity for the new Dodge Durango sport/utility vehicle in Newark, Del., as well as increased line speeds for the Dodge Ram pickup truck in St. Louis, and increased production of Dodge Dakota pickup trucks in Warren, Mich.
Chrysler plans to unveil the Durango at the Detroit auto show later Tuesday.  
In other capacity moves, Eaton also said Chrysler has tentatively planned to add a third production shift to its Bramalea, Ontario, car assembly plant after it launches production of a new generation of LH family sedans later this year.
The LH line includes the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and LHS and Eagle Vision, which also are expected to be introduced at the show.
Eaton said despite sluggish industry car sales the increasing popularity and profitability of light truck models, the automaker has not cut back on investment in future car programs.  
However, he said Chrysler may shift its investment plans if trucks continue to gain market share. ""We're going to put the money where the market goes,"" he said, adding that new, more efficient truck engines should allow Chrysler to continue to increase truck capacity without violating federal fuel economy laws.  
Eaton said he is pleased with the financial stability that Chrysler has acheived in recent years, but it still needs to continue to prove itself to Wall Street to earn a higher stock price and raise its price-to-earnings ratio above the current level of 7.3 percent. Chrysler shares were trading down 1/4 at 35-3/8.
He reiterated that Chrysler can earn still earn a profit even if U.S. automotive industry sales fall by 20 percent.

DavidLawder,"General Motors Corp., stung by years of steady losses in its U.S. market share -- including another 1.3 percentage points in 1996 -- Wednesday vowed to aggressively reverse the trend in 1997.
""In 1997, we plan on aggressively increasing our U.S. share,"" Chairman Jack Smith told reporters at the North American International Auto Show here.
GM remains the world's largest automaker, but it has sunk far since its glory days in the 1960s when it commanded half of the U.S. market. As recently as the mid-1980s it held as much as 45 percent of the U.S. passenger car market.
In 1996, GM's U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.7 percent to 4.74 million units, causing its market share to drop to 31.3 percent from 32.6 percent in 1995 and 33.1 percent in 1994.
Smith said the company's U.S. market share was hurt in 1996 by costly labor strikes in March and October, as well as by factory down-time to retool for new models.
The strikes by the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers cost GM an estimated $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in profits in 1996 as the company lost production of about 300,000 vehicles, said GM North American Operations President G. Richard Wagoner.
Wagoner added, however, that the strikes were ""worth it"" because they resulted in productivity-related gains for the automaker.
Smith added that there could be other work stoppages, as GM still needed to reach local labor agreements at many of its assembly and parts plants.
Assuming GM's labor relations are peaceful, the company expects to utilize more than 90 percent of its North American factory capacity in 1997, which will significantly help the company's profitability.
GM's factory utilization in 1996 fell below the 85 percent it had in 1995, but was still well above the dark days of 1991-92, when it sank to 60-65 percent and led to massive losses.
Wagoner said GM was getting back on track toward reaching its goal of a 5 percent return on sales in North America but would not reach that level until the end of the decade.
Smith said GM was in a ""strong position"" to regain market share this year with 15 new models being introduced during the 1997 model year. GM will not sacrifice profitability to gain market share, but will stay competitive with other automakers in offering incentives, he said.
""What we're looking for is for our products to sell themselves,"" Smith said. ""If we're in a market where somebody else has heavy incentives, we're going to be competitive. We're going to be a player.""
GM, however, sees greater opportunities for growth in its international operations, where sales in 1997 are expected to expand to $38 billion from $35 billion in 1996.
Worldwide, Smith said GM holds about 17 percent of the global car and truck market and is aiming to raise that share by expanding into growing areas of the world, including Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
GM will expand its investments in overseas operations faster than in the United States, but it does not plan to cut back on North American product investment.
Smith also announced that the automaker was developing new technologies that could help improve the fuel efficiency of its cars by 50 percent. Those include:
-- A new direct-injection diesel engine that is now being introduced in overseas markets. The four-cylinder diesel could raise fuel economy in GM's minivans to 38 miles per gallon from about 20 miles per gallon for current V-6 gasoline engines.
-- An electric-powered transmission flywheel that gives a boost to a conventional drivetrain and increases fuel economy. It also acts as a starter and alternator for the vehicle.
-- Lightweight aluminum body structures that save weight.
-- Hybrid electric vehicle technology that combine internal combustion engines and electric motors to gain dramatic range and efficiency improvements over both electric and conventional cars.

""I don't see that anything changed,"" Lutz said. As of Jan. 1, Lutz gave up his president and chief operating officer titles to become vice chairman in anticipation of his 65th birthday in February.
Lutz is largely credited with turning around Chrysler's product development operations by instituting a system of super-efficient ""platform teams"" to bring each new vehicle to market. He said he will continue to act as a coach and mentor to engineers working on Chrysler's car and truck programmes.
Lutz said he will probably stay at Chrysler for a maximum of two more years.
""I have to use this transitional period to ease myself out gradually, because the harsh reality is that I cannot stay around until I'm 70,"" he said. ""I would be seriously worried about a company that had its product fortunes guided by a 70-year-old guy. That usually results in cars directed at 70-year-olds.""
Chrysler stock was unchanged at $35.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.

DavidLawder,"Ford Motor Co., moving to stem losses in Europe, said Sunday it will restructure but not close its giant Halewood car plant in England, with some job losses expected.
Susanne Wegerhoff, a Ford spokeswoman in Brentwood, England, said the automaker will announce operating changes for the plant after a meeting scheduled for Thursday with major unions. She denied a British newspaper report that Ford was threatening to close the facility.
""Halewood is going to have a future. What we are going to talk about is a plan to secure a realistic future for Halewood,"" Wegerhoff said in a telephone interview.
She declined to discuss specifics before the meeting with the Transport and General Workers union and other unions, adding that ""it is people's careers we're talking about.""
London's Observer newspaper reported on Saturday that Ford wanted to cut 500 jobs at Halewood and install new, more efficient work practices. The newspaper said Ford would threaten to close the plant or build its next-generation Escort elsewhere if unions fail to agree to the concessions.
The plant, which employs 6,500 workers, produces Ford's European-designed Escort sub-compact cars. Similar in size to the U.S.-built Escort, the cars are Ford's main mid-range models in Europe, competing with Volkswagen AG's Golf and General Motors Corp.'s Opel Astra.
The moves to restructure the Halewood plant come as Ford is struggling in Europe. In the third quarter of 1996, the latest figures available, Ford's losses in Europe climbed to $472 million from $320 million in the year-earlier period.
Ford Chairman Alex Trotman declined to comment last week on fourth quarter and full-year 1996 European results, but said he expected a profit in Europe for the current year.
Industry analysts consider the Halewood plant in northwestern England the least efficient of Ford's three Escort plants in Europe, including its sister facility at Dagenham in London, which also builds smaller Fiesta models, and the Saarlouis, Germany, plant.
""We have an issue of overcapacity, particularly in that segment of medium-sized cars,"" Wegerhoff said.
In a meeting Friday with Wall Street analysts, Ford executives said they planned to take actions to reduce excess capacity but did not offer specifics, Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said.
At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit last week, Ford Automotive Operations President Jacques Nasser said Ford wanted to avoid outright plant closures.
""We prefer to use the facilities and the resources we've got,"" Nasser said in an interview.
Ford's previous two European Escort models have been a disappointment for the automaker in the heart of the European car market. The next generation Escort, expected to debut in 1999, will be the first car engineered under Ford's new global product development structure, dubbed ""Ford 2000.""

DavidLawder,"The scrutinized right engine of a Comair commuter aircraft was replaced on Jan. 4, five days before the plane plunged into a snowy Michigan field, killing 29 people, the airline said on Tuesday.
Meghan Glynn, a spokeswoman for Erlanger, Ky.-based Comair Holdings Inc, said the engine on the Embraer 120 Brasilia turboprop was replaced during routine maintenance operations. She said the company does not believe the engine change was a factor in the crash.
But the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW118 engine has become a major focus of the federal crash probe, as cockpit controls indicated that pilots may have tried to shut down the engine and activate a fire extinguishing system.
A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board was not immediately available to comment on the significance of the engine replacement.
But NTSB investigators have said previously there was evidence that the right engine's propeller may have been over-speeding, or racing out of control, shortly before the crash. There was no evidence of an in-flight fire.
The 30-seat commuter plane nosedived to earth in a snowstorm on Jan. 9 in Raisinville Township, Mich., as it was making a 30-degree left-hand turn on its approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport from Cincinnati. Comair flight 3272's 26 passengers and three crew members died instantly in the fiery impact.
According to flight data recorder information released late on Monday, trouble started 38 seconds before the crash, when the plane kept turning to the left, even though the autopilot tried to move it to the right.
The autopilot disengaged and a stall warning -- a mechanism that vibrates the plane's control stick when wings lose lift -- went off about 17 seconds before the crash.
Within the next five seconds, the plane's nose tipped from three degrees up to 50 degrees down, and the aircraft rolled violently. Cockpit voice recordings revealed that the crew was silent during the doomed plane's final oscillations.
Aviation experts said an over-speeding engine would pose serious control problems for such a turboprop aircraft, since one engine would be providing too much thrust, throwing the plane out of balance.
""If you had an engine over-speed situation, you'd go through an engine shutdown,"" said Richard Schaden, a pilot and air crash attorney based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
In addition, NTSB officials said another pilot in the vicinity reported icing conditions 20 minutes after the crash. Ice formation on wings or propellers can wreak havoc an aircraft's ability to maintain lift and control.
""It sounded like it hit them all at once,"" Beau Murphey, a former Comair pilot, told the Detroit News. ""If you're making a 30-degree left-hand turn and your right propeller over-speeds, man, you're in trouble.""
Schaden said he is representing families of three of the victims and eventually plans to file lawsuits on behalf of them. He said the suits may be filed in Broward County, Fla., because the U.S. headquarters of the plane's Brazilian-based maker, Embraer SA, is located in Fort Lauderdale.
Michigan ""is not a very good jurisdiction for victims these days,"" because of recent laws limiting non-economic damages to $500,000 in personal liability cases.
Meanwhile, recovery of wreckage at the crash site near Monroe, Mich., continued Tuesday, and more parts of the aircraft were moved to a building at the nearby county fairgrounds.
Monroe County Medical Examiner David Lieberman said all victim remains had been removed from the site and most had been identified. All died of massive injuries and had to be identified through fingerprints or dental records, he said.

DavidLawder,"Pulling back from the battered car rental business, Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it agreed to sell its interests in Budget Rent a Car Corp. to a Florida firm in a deal valued at about $350 million.
Team Rental Group Inc., the Daytona Beach-based buyer, already owns and operates 13 Budget franchises with 155 locations. It also leases commuter vans in 22 states and sells used vehicles.
""In light of investor interest in the entire rental car industry, we concluded that it is now in the best interests of Budget and Ford if Team Rental, Budget's largest franchisee, were to acquire Budget. It's a good fit,"" Ford Vice Chairman Ed Hagenlocker said in a statement.
Although the sale of Ford's preferred stock in Budget is not expected to close until March, the automaker said it will book an unspecified gain on the deal in its fourth quarter 1996 earnings.
The gain will partially reverse a $437 million after-tax write-off Ford took on its investment and on loans to Budget in the second quarter.
The deal also will add cash to Ford's coffers, bringing it closer to a future stock repurchase program.
Ford spokesman Christian Vinyard said top Ford executives told analysts Friday that the company will consider such repurchases after it cuts automotive costs by $1 billion and boosts cash reserves above their current level of $7 billion.
""We said it's on the menu, but way down the line,"" Vinyard said of a stock buyback program. ""Don't be looking for it in the March or April timeframe.""
Tuesday's deal marked a major shift by Ford to reduce its rental car holdings and reverses a plan announced by the automaker last year to acquire full ownership of Budget.
Ford also has said it may sell a partial stake in its Hertz Corp. subsidiary, among other strategic options it examining.
Archrival General Motors Corp.  has already divested its holdings in National Car Rental System Inc. and Avis Inc., while Chrysler Corp.'s Dollar and Thrifty units remain on the sale block.
Analysts said a new breed of bottom line-oriented investors was now taking a dominant role in car rental industry.
""That industry has gotten a little fat,"" said George Magliano, an automotive consultant with WEFA Group in New York. ""They sit with a lot of cars that go unrented. And when that happens, the bottom line is destroyed,"" said George
Lisle, Ill.-based Budget, together with its independent licensees, ranks as the world's fourth-largest rental car business, Ford said.
Ford does not own Budget outright, but controls it through a stock purchase option.
""We have the right to direct the sale of the common shares and that's what we have done,"" Vinyard said.
A Team Rental spokesman said the company will pay $275 million in cash and issue non-voting preferred securities convertible into 4.5 million shares of Team common stock with a minimum value at closing of $75 million.
The board of Team Rental already has approved the deal, spokesman Steve Polito said.
Ford said it would continue to be a major supplier of cars and trucks to Budget's fleet. The transaction also includes a new vehicle supply arrangement between Ford and Budget.
Automakers began acquiring rental car companies in the mid-1980s with the idea that they could absorb unsold auto inventory into their fleets and keep Detroit's factories running.
That strategy worked for a few years, but then backfired when sales of barely used rental vehicles began eating into new car sales.
The Budget deal is the second major car rental sale in just over a week. On Jan. 6, investor H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries Inc. bought National from a private investor group for $600 million. Republic bought Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. late last year.
Ford's stock closed up 50 cents at $33.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

DavidLawder,"General Motors Corp. said Friday it will consolidate all of its commercial truck production in Flint, Mich., but will discontinue some engineering work there and in Lansing, Mich.
The moves ensure a solid future for the automaker's truck plant in Flint, which will expand its work force by up to 3,000 jobs by the year 2001, according to United Auto Workers officials. It now employs about 2,000 workers.
But the gain for Flint, a beleagured GM factory town hit hard by job losses in recent years, will be a blow to Detroit's inner city. GM said it will close a 78-year-old truck and bus chassis plant in Detroit that employs 494 people and move the production to Flint in the year 2000.
About 90 engineers at the six-story plant will be transferred immediately to GM facilities in Pontiac, Mich.
GM also will shift production of medium-duty commercial trucks from Janesville, Wis., to Flint, in 2001. The Janesville truck line employs about 1,000 people, but GM officials say many of those workers should be absorbed by Janesville's full-size sport utility vehicle assembly line.
GM said the Janesville plant will build the next-generation Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon vehicles, but it did not disclose any plans to expand Janesville's capacity to build the trucks.
GM will begin building the popular sport utility vehicles at a second plant, in Arlington, Texas, later this year.
The auto giant said it will invest about $500 million in the Flint truck plant to prepare it for the medium-duty truck production and to expand its capacity to build the next generation of GM's full-size C/K pickup trucks.
The plant currently builds larger commercial versions of C/K pickups, but before Friday's announcement, GM had not assigned it a future product, leaving its fate clouded.
The investments will pay for two new body shops, a second paint shop and additional chassis, trim and general assembly lines at the facility. Expanded production at the plant will increase GM's truck production capacity by about 5 percent, allowing it to grab a bigger share of the expanding truck market.
However, long before Flint sees new jobs at the truck plant, it will have to give up the jobs of about 950 engine and transmission engineers, which GM will transfer to other facilities in Warren and Milford, Mich., in 1998.
GM also is discontinuing other powertrain engineering work in Lansing that employs about 600 people. That work also will be transferred to Warren and Milford.
Another 550 engineers have already been transferred to those locations from elsewhere in the Detroit area, bringing the total affected by the powertrain moves to 2,100.
The consolidation moves are aimed at reducing GM's production and operating costs, but GM officials did not specify the expected savings.
""The optimization of our facilities will allow us to reduce our structural costs, make better use of our resources and improve our productivity,"" said Ned McClurg, general manager of the GM Powertrain Group.
Few of the production workers displaced by the moves will be left without a paycheck. Under GM's UAW contract, it must continue to pay workers who are idled by such actions.
A day after it announced the long-awaited, $9.5 billion sale of its Hughes Aircraft defense operations to Raytheon Co., GM's stock had slipped 25 cents to $60.125 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"
DavidLawder,"In addition to the $9.5 billion in value that General Motors Corp. and its shareholders will see from selling Hughes Aircraft Co., GM said Friday it will gain about $100 million in annual savings from no longer having to write off Hughes' goodwill, or intangible assets.
Each quarter, GM writes off about $25 million worth of good will associated with its 1985 purchase of the Hughes defence assets, said GM spokesman Mark Tanner. He said the write-offs will end after the complicated sale to Raytheon Co. closes, an event expected by midyear.
""Project Triple Play,"" as the massive deal was known to GM executives, includes the spin-off and merger of the Hughes defence business with Raytheon, the shift of Hughes' Delco Electronics business into GM's automotive operations, and the infusion of capital into Hughes' remaining telecommunications and space satellite business.
Most of the $4.4 billion in cash that GM will receive in the deal will be injected into the telcommunications business, which will continue to use the Hughes Electronics Corp. name.
GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh said the biggest single use of that cash will be to complete Hughes Electronics' $3 billion acquisition of satellite services company PanAmSat Corp.
GM also will use the cash to fund the growth of its DirecTV satellite broadcasting business and its Hughes Network Systems business.
The automaker has no plans to spin off the telecommunications business, which is growing quickly.
""We think it's a very exciting business to be in,"" GM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said Thursday. ""We think we're early in terms of the potential of the business.""
Losh said also said holders of GM's Class H common stock will receive additional shares in the post-merger Raytheon to compensate them for GM's plan to move Delco Electronics out of Hughes and into into its Delphi Automotive Systems subsidiary.
Currently, Class H shareholders have a 25 percent interest in Delco's earnings, while GM and its automotive shareholders control the rest.
But Losh said Class H shareholders will get more than 25 percent of the new Raytheon shares allocated to all GM stockholders. GM's automotive shareholders will get less than 75 percent.
Overall, GM stockholders will control 30 percent of Raytheon after the Hughes merger.
GM Class H stock, currently tied to Hughes' Delco, defence and telecommunications business, closed up 37.5 cents Friday at $63 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Raytheon closed up 25 cents at $48.75, while GM's automotive stock lost 50 cents to $60.125.

In an interview Friday, GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh also said GM's Class H shareholders will receive additional shares in the post-merger Raytheon to compensate them for GM's plan to move Delco Electronics out of Hughes and into into its Delphi Automotive Systems subsidiary.
The amount of Raytheon shares that will be distributed to holders of Class H shares versus the holders of GM $1-2/3 par-value, or autmotive, stock, will be determined when GM assigns a value to Delco, which makes automotive electronics.
""That's a valuation that's being done by the investment bankers right now,"" Losh said.  
Currently, Class H shareholders have a 25 percent interest in Delco's earnings, while GM and its automotive shareholders control the rest. But Losh said Class H shareholders will get more than 25 percent of the new Raytheon shares allocated to all GM stockholders. GM's automotive shareholders will get less than 75 percent.
Overall, GM stockholders will control 30 percent of Raytheon after the Hughes merger.
Delco will be valued based on its current performance as well as its future performance potential as a part of Delphi.  
For the first nine months of 1996, Delco's operating profit fell to $562 million from $655 million in the same period of 1995. Revenues for the 1996 period fell to $4.1 billion from $4.15 billion in 1995.
""If your're an H shareholder, in effect what you get is a new defense stock that's the equivalent of your 25 percent holdings in (Hughes) defense today, plus compensation for the 25 percent holding in Delco Electronics that's going back to GM and an exchange of today's H stock for a new H stock that's a telecommunications and space stock.""  
Kenneth Blaschke, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc, said he did not expect the valuation of Delco to significantly alter the distribution ratio of new Raytheon shares beyond the 75 percent-25 percent mix.
GM Class H stock, currently tied to Hughes' Delco, defense and telecommunications business, closed up 25 cents Friday at $63 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Raytheon closed up 12 cents at $48.625, while GM's automotive stock lost 37.5 cents to $60.  
Losh said ""Project Triple Play,"" as the massive transaction was known to GM executives, will give Class H shareholders a stock that tracks a more focused, fast growing telecommunications company.
The three steps of the deal as they saw it included the the spinoff and merger of Hughes defense assets, pulling Delco back into GM's automotive operations and infusing capital into Hughes remaining telecommunications and space operations.
Most of the $4.4 billion in cash that GM will receive in the deal will be injected into the telcom business, which will continue to use the Hughes Electronics Corp name.  
The biggest single use of that cash will be to complete Hughes Electronics' $3 billion acquisition of satellite services company PanAmSat Corp.

DavidLawder,"Buoyed by strong sales of light trucks, Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, but special charges held the automaker back from its best-ever full-year profit.
Detroit's No. 3 automaker posted net income of $807 million, or $1.12 per share, during the fourth quarter after $279 million in charges. Excluding those charges, Chrysler's operating earnings were a record $1.09 billion, or $1.51 a share. In the fourth quarter of 1995, Chrysler posted profits of $1.04 billion, or $1.33 a share.
Chrysler's full-year 1996 net income came to $3.53 billion, or $4.74 per share, including $347 million in special charges. The total fell short of the company's 1994 all-time record of $3.71 billion.
On a pretax basis, Chrysler earned $6.09 billion for all of 1996, a full-year record that topped 1995's $3.45 billion.
Chrysler, which was fighting for its life five years ago, rewarded its 79,000 U.S. employees handsomely for the 1996 results, saying they will receive average profit-sharing checks of $7,900 in February -- more than double the $3,200 they received last year.
Comerica Bank economist David Littman estimated that the payments to Chrysler's 45,000 workers in Michigan could boost the state's economy by as much as $356 million.
Wall Street also cheered the results. Chrysler's stock rose $1.50 a share to close at $36 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said shares of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which report results next week, rose in sympathy. GM shares closed up $1.25 at $62, while Ford shares closed up 50 cents at $33.625.
Driving the gains for 1996 was a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales, to 2.96 million from 2.67 million in 1995. Strong sales of trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans, pushed Chrysler's 1996 share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market to 16.1 percent from 14.7 percent in 1995.
""There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products,"" Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement. ""That's the challenge we're all focused on and its one I'm confident we'll meet.""
During the fourth quarter, Chrysler's profit was reduced by $279 million in charges that covered the early retirement of debt; higher United Auto Workers pension costs; a voluntary early retirement program; and the write-down of Chrysler's investment in Pentastar Electronics, a defence subsidiary sold to a Huntsville, Ala., investor group for $17 million.
Excluding the charges, Chrysler earned $1.09 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.88 billion for the year, beating two-year-old records for operating results.
John Casesa, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim, said a strong mix of high-profit vehicles, such as minivans and Dodge Ram pickup trucks, led to an increase of in the company's profit margin to 22.3 percent from 20.8 percent.
Chrysler's fourth quarter profit per vehicle -- viewed as the envy of the industry -- rose $60 from a year earlier to $1,331, but fell short of the company's record level of $1,350 in the fourth quarter of 1994.
""It was a good quarter, but I don't think it was a great quarter,"" said PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward. ""They are not at their peak operating margin.""
Ward and other analysts said the margin pressure was due to an increase in U.S. incentives per vehicle to $660 from $495 in 1995 and $410 in 1994. Increased spending on new products and overseas expansion, as well as higher labour and pension costs, also helped to eat into margins.
Still, Chrysler is ""hitting on all cylinders, and they're sold out,"" noted Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.analyst Ron Glantz.
Eaton told reporters in a conference call that Chrysler's financial position was so strong it might not need to dip into its approximately $7 billion cash reserve to fund operations and stay profitable during the next industry downturn.
""That would allow us to use a significant portion of our cash reserves for growth opportunities that might just occur during such a downturn,"" Eaton said.

DavidLawder,"Riding a crest of popular vehicles, Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, but special charges held the automaker back from its best-ever full-year profit.
The U.S. No. 3 automaker earned $807 million, or $1.12 per share, during the fourth quarter after $279 million in charges. Excluding those charges, Chryler's operating earnings were a record $1.09 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Chrysler posted net income of $1.04 billion, or $1.33 a share.
Chrysler stock jumped $1.625 to $36.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
""Our 1996 results were outstanding in virtually every respect thanks to what is arguably the strongest product lineup in the industry and to the dedication of our people who have worked so hard to get us where we are today,"" Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement.
Chrysler reported full-year 1996 net income of $3.53 billion, or $4.74 per share.
The automaker's 1996 profit fell short of its 1994 record of $3.71 billion because of $347 million in special charges taken during 1996. On a pretax basis, Chrysler earned $6.09 billion for all of 1996, a new calendar-year record that topped 1995's $3.45 billion.
The company, which had its most recent brush with bankruptcy in 1991, rewarded its U.S. employees handsomely in 1996 with average profit-sharing checks of $7,900 -- more than double the $3,200 they received in 1995.
Based on pretax earnings, Chrysler said the profit sharing was below the $8,000 it paid out for 1994 because more employees will share in the profits. About 79,000 hourly and salaried workers in the United States will receive their payments in February. Two years ago, Chrysler issued profit sharing checks to 75,200 workers in the United States.
During the fourth quarter, Chrysler's profit was reduced by $279 million in charges that covered the early retirement of debt; higher United Auto Workers pension costs; a voluntary early retirement program; and the write-down of Pentastar Electronics, a subsidiary sold to a Huntsville, Ala., investor group for $17 million.
Excluding the charges, Chrysler earned $1.09 billion, or $1.51 a share, in the quarter and $3.88 billion, or $5.21, for the year, beating two-year-old records for operating results.
Wall Street cheered the results, which beat analysts' fourth-quarter consensus operating estimate of $1.43 a share.
John Casesa, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim, said the most impressive news was an increase in the quarter's gross profit margin to 22.3 percent from 20.8 percent -- thanks to high-profit vehicles such as the Ram pickup trucks and minivans.
""The highlight was the company's gross margin was very good, and that reflects a continued rich product mix,"" he said.
Eaton told reporters in a conference call that Chrysler's financial position was so strong it might not need to dip into its approximately $7 billion cash reserve to fund operations and stay profitable during the next industry downturn.
""That would allow us to use a significant portion of our cash reserves for growth opportunities that might just occur during such a downturn,"" Eaton said.
Casesa said it was the first time Eaton has made such a prediction. ""It would be the first time in decades any automaker would have been able to do that,"" Casesa said.
He added that growth opportunities could include purchasing vehicle assembly capacity cheaply from a competitor that needed to unload a costly plant during a recession.
Chrysler attributed its strong performance to a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales, to 2,958,800 from 2,673,539 in 1995.
Based on strong sales of trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans, Chrysler's share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market climbed to 16.1 percent for the year from 14.7 percent in 1995.
Eaton said in a statement the company would not rest on its laurels.
""There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products,"" Eaton said. ""That's the challenge we're all focused on and its one I'm confident we'll meet.""

DavidLawder,"Chrysler Corp., capping the strongest annual sales performance in its history, said Tuesday it earned $807 million during the fourth quarter of 1996, with special charges holding it back from its best full-year profit ever.
Detroit's No. 3 automaker reported full-year 1996 net income of $3.53 billion, or $4.77 per common share, compared with $2.025 billion, or $2.65 a share, for calendar-year 1995.
Last year's results fell short of Chrysler's 1994 record of $3.71 billion because of $347 million in special charges.
Chrysler said it finished 1996 with 2,450,826 U.S. retail vehicle sales, including fleet sales, which broke the 1988 calendar-year record of 2,208,057.
""One of the highlights of the year was the fact that according to independent data, Chrysler is the only auto manufacturer to beat industry average in both owner loyalty, or repurchase rate, and new customer conquest rate in 1996,"" Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said.
""That's the best way to grow the company and we did, increasing our combined U.S. and Canadian retail market share by 1.4 percentage points,"" he added.
The fourth quarter's results, equal to $1.12 a share, compared with profits of $1.04 billion, or $1.35 a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues climbed to $16.2 billion from $15.1 billion.
Chrysler's performance in the latest period included charges totalling $279 million related to the retirement of debt, the write-down of its investment in Pentastar Electronics, lump sum retiree pension costs and a voluntary early retirement programme.
On an operating basis, both the fourth quarter and full year were records for Chrysler.
Excluding the charges, Chrysler earned $1.09 billion in the quarter and $3.88 billion for the year, beating out its previous operating records of $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter of 1994 and $3.58 billion in the full 1994 year.
Chrysler attributed its strong performance to a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales, to 2,958,800 from 2,673,539 in 1995.
Based on strong sales of trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans, Chrysler's share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market climbed to 16.1 percent for the year from 14.7 percent in 1995.
Eaton said, however, that the company will not rest on its laurels.
""There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products,"" he said in a statement accompanying the results.
""That's the challenge we're all focused on and it's one I'm confident we'll meet.""
Chrysler said its employees will share the wealth, with about 79,000 U.S. hourly and salaried workers receiving an average profit-sharing payment of $7,900 in February.
That compares with $3,200 for the company's 1995 performance and $8,000 for the 1994 performance, which was received by about 75,200 employees.
Chrysler's stock rose 62.5 cents to $35.125 in very early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

DavidLawder,"Comerica Inc. said Wednesday it will cut 1,890 jobs, or about 16 percent of its work force, as part of an effort to slash costs and boost revenues by $110 million annually by the first half of 1998.
The Detroit-based banking company said the restructuring actions caused it to incur a $90 million pretax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings, which fell to $60.8 million, or 52 cents a share, from $106.5 million, or 92 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Comerica, with $34 billion in assets at the end of 1996, said the actual number of employees to be laid off may be less than 1,890 because of attrition, a hiring freeze and reinvestment actions.
The company has about 12,000 employees in Michigan, Texas, California and Florida. The cuts will fall in all four states and will take place between now and mid-1998, Comerica said.
""Regrettably, as we streamline processes and eliminate redundancies, a number of employees throughout the corporation will be displaced,"" Comerica Chairman Eugene Miller said in a statement. ""To assist these employees, we have put in place an enhanced severance plan with out placement services to help their transition.""
Comerica also said it planned to close about a dozen branch offices.
Comerica, Michigan's largest independent bank holding company, has been the subject of merger speculation in the past year. However, it has steadfastly maintained it is not interested in being acquired by an out-of-state bank and has instead embarked on a long effort to streamline its operations.
Comerica said the third phase of its restructuring effort includes other initiatives to reduce costs and enhance revenues. They include:
-- Eliminating one-third of paper forms and replacing them with electronic forms.
-- Simplifying the referral and delivery of investment services.
-- Giving branch employees more authority and reducing their clerical duties so they can serve customers better.
-- Reducing the documentation required to open a new account.
-- Streamlining the credit approval process.
-- Streamlining financial and operations reporting.
For the full year, Comerica earned $417.2 million, or $3.55 a share, up from $413.4 million, or $3.54 a share, in 1995.

DavidLawder,"Trampling a half-century of tradition, United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich is reinventing the way the union negotiates its biggest and richest contract.
At every turn in the triennial ritual of labor negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers, Yokich has surprised industry observers with new, ground-breaking twists, such as dispensing with the traditional concept of a ""strike target.""
On Tuesday, he quietly anointed Ford Motor Co. to lead the negotiations for a new contract covering over 385,000 workers. At the same time, the UAW will continue talks with General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. -- leaving the door slightly open for them to come up with a last minute offer and putting subtle pressure on Ford.
""Yokich is an unusually confident and bold leader,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley. ""He knows where he wants to go, and if a precedent is preventing from getting there, he throws it out.""
The 61-year-old Yokich, who became the UAW's eighth president last year, has even downplayed the importance of enforcing a strict pattern agreement at all three automakers -- something held sacred by the UAW for decades.
Every three years since roughly the end of World War II, the UAW has selected a strike target to hammer out a pattern agreement for all three companies, with the threat of a national strike if talks run past contract's expiration.
In many cases, the contracts were negotiated partly through the media, with both sides publicly castigating each other.
""I remember back in the early to mid-80s, it was an 'I'll take whatever I can get' attitude on both sides,"" said PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward.
But Yokich prefers to duck the media limelight and has gone out of his way to show that he doesn't want a strike, even to the point of saying that he has banishing the word ""strike target"" from his vocabulary.
""Our members didn't elect us to go out on strike, they elected us to bring them an agreement,"" Yokich said last month.
Yokich, who worked as a tool and die maker before entering union politics, has a close relationship with Peter Pestillo, Ford executive vice president of corporate relations, which analysts believe will help smooth the way for a quick settlement.
Indeed, UAW officials in recent days say that with less than two weeks to go before the contract expires Sept. 14, bargainers at all three companies are closer to agreements than at the same point in any prior negotiation year.
There may be other breakthroughs -- the UAW and Ford have discussed the possibility of a longer contract of up to five or six years, and Ford has shown some willingness to encourage suppliers to allow the UAW to organize their plants.
Labor analysts said they expect him to come up with an agreement that provides some improved job security for UAW members, but will not hamstring the automakers' competitiveness.
""Yokich is a fairly sensible negotiator,"" Ward said. ""He has a big-picture view of the industry.""
He also has a big-picture view of labor, causing him to embark last year on what may one day be viewed as his greatest accomplishment, the proposed merger of the UAW, the United Steel Workers and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers into a giant metal trades union with over 2 million members.
Retired UAW leaders applaud Yokich's new direction and do not view him as tearing down their legacy.
""He's breaking out of the mold and trying something different,"" Doug Fraser, who was the UAW president in the late 1970s and early 1980s. ""In my view it can only be positive.""
"
DavidLawder,"General Motors Corp. stock rose Friday on widening optimism that the auto giant's board of directors on Monday will reward shareholders with a dividend increase and stock buyback programme of up to $5 billion, analysts said.
GM shares were up $1.125 to $63 in composite trading after hitting a 52-week high of $63.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.
Analysts said GM, flying high a week after it announced the sale of its Hughes Aircraft defence operations to Raytheon Corp. in a deal worth $9.5 billion, was working to catch up with rivals Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in returning cash to shareholders.
""I think GM is looking at this rightly. It's time to pay the shareholders for their patience,"" said CS First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas. ""They want to hand some cash back to shareholders who have been long waiting on the suffering side.""
GM spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said GM was scheduled to consider its dividend at the board meeting, but would not comment on a possible increase or stock buyback programme.
The automaker could have afforded such a move last fall, but analysts said it did not want a big payoff to shareholders throwing a wrench into tense contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union.
Analysts estimated that the board, which holds its regularly scheduled board meeting for February on Monday, will increase the quarterly dividend by 10 cents to 20 cents a share and announce $2 billion to $3 billion in stock repurchases this year. GM now pays a quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share.
Colas said his estimate that GM will buyback $3 billion worth of stock this year was based on expectations that GM ended 1996 with $15 billion in cash, $3 billion above its target of $12 billion.
He noted that Chrysler, less than a third of GM's size, plans to repurchase $2 billion worth of shares in 1997. Chrysler's buyback programme has put a floor under the automaker's stock, allowing it to outperform its rivals.
Smith Barney analyst David Garrity said the board could authorise as much as $5 billion in repurchases over a longer period of time.
GM's dividend hike will be aimed at improving the automakers dividend yield to competitive levels, analysts said. It now is at 2.59 percent, compared with 4.56 percent for Ford and 4.57 percent for Chrysler.
A regular share repurchase programme also would lend stability to GM's share price and help it sustain its recent gains, analysts say.
In the past month alone, GM shares have risen about 15 percent, from about $55 a share, largely on anticipation of the Hughes deal, news that it settled its industrial espionage dispute with Volkswagen AG and expectations of strong cash flow.
""They've packed an awful lot of good news into a short period of time,"" Bear Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Nicholas Lobaccaro said. ""They've accomplished the goal of getting the stock price up, and now the challenge is to sustain it. That can only get done through consistent earnings for several quarters.""
The euphoria over the Hughes deal has overshadowed GM's fourth quarter earnings, which are expected to show the ravages of lower production due to strikes and model launches.
GM has said U.S. and Canadian strikes in October and November reduced its fourth quarter results by $700 million. The automaker also is taking a $170 million charge for lump-sum payments associated with its new United Auto Workers contract.
According to consensus Wall Street estimates, GM on Tuesday is expected to post fourth quarter earnings of about $385 million, or 51 cents a share, which excludes the $170 million charge.
In the fourth quarter of 1995, GM earned a record $1.9 billion, or $1.98 a share, a figure helped by about $577 million worth of tax benefits.
"
DavidLawder,"For the second time in a row, the United Auto Workers union has chosen Ford Motor Co. to lead the union's labor contract negotiations with the Big Three U.S. automakers, officials said late on Tuesday.
UAW vice president Ernest Lofton said union leaders notified Ford executives of the decision Tuesday, but added that the union was not viewing the company as a traditional ""strike target"" in the talks.
""They are the lead company in regards to resolving our 1996 negotiations,"" Lofton said Tuesday night in a brief interview on WDIV-TV.
The selection will allow the No. 2 U.S. automaker to negotiate an agreement that will serve as a pattern for rivals General Motors Corp and Chrysler Corp to follow.
Contracts covering nearly 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at all three companies expire September 14. Despite the conciliatory talk, Ford as the target company faces the threat of a national strike if it fails to reach an agreement before the expiration.
Ford spokesman Jon Harmon would only read the following statement Tuesday: ""We're hard at work negotiating with the UAW at the subcommittee level as well as at the main table, and we are encouraged by the tone of the negotiations,"" he said.
""Our team is working under the assumption that we will be closely involved in whatever transpires over the next two weeks. And that's been our preference all along.""
The decision marks the second time in a row that the union has chosen Ford to lead its Big Three U.S. negotiations. Ford, which employs about 104,000 UAW members,  negotiated the current pact in 1993 and is widely viewed to have the best union relations among the three automakers.
The UAW's top priorities in the 1996 negotiations are improved job security for its workers and restrictions on the automakers' ability to shift work to lower-cost outside suppliers. Analysts say Ford has shown willingness to cooperate with the union on both fronts.
General Motors has been shrinking its workforce in an effort to become cost-competitive, presenting negotiators with more difficult problems to overcome. The UAW typically has first gone to the company where it believes it could reach the most favorable contract with the least amount of difficulty.
Chrysler, which UAW officials say was less willing to meet their demands, has instead been chosen as the Canadian Auto Workers union's negotiating target. The CAW's Big Three labor contract, covering about 53,000 workers, has been extended until September 17.
"
DavidLawder,"General Motors Corp.'s board of directors Monday approved a $2.5 billion stock buyback programme and a 25 percent dividend hike, but the moves apparently were not enough to satisfy Wall Street's inflated expectations.
GM shares were off $1.875 at $60.625 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
""Failure to generate a positive surprise is punished without mercy by the stock market,"" said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy, who noted that GM's moves were widely anticipated.
Some analysts had predicted GM would boost the payout by up to 50 percent and commit to buying back up to $5 billion worth of stock, which pushed GM shares up last week.
The auto giant said the stock repurchases would take place over the next 12 months and at current prices would reduce the number of its automotive shares by slightly more than 5 percent.
GM raised its quarterly dividend on the automotive shares to 50 cents a share from 40 cents previously. It was the third increase since May 1995, but left GM's payout well short of its peak of 75 cents a share in 1989 and 1990.
The automaker does not plan to release its year-end 1996 earnings results until Tuesday, but it said Monday that it ended 1996 with a whopping cash balance of $17 billion, up from $10.2 billion at the end of 1995.
Many analysts had estimated GM's cash pile at $15 billion.
Auto analyst Scott Merlis, president of Merlis Automotive International, said that showed GM had the resources to buy back shares for a long time to come.
""I would see this repurchase as the tip of the iceberg and the first of a sustainable repurchase programme that can boost earnings per share by 5 percent a year,"" Merlis said.
GM Chairman Jack Smith said in a statement that the automaker will consider additional stock buybacks in the future and added that GM's board was committed to enhancing shareholder value.
He also noted that GM's new dividend rate would be sustainable through the ups and downs of the business cycle.
""We intend to pursue the repurchase programme vigorously,"" Smith added. ""The decision to announce a $2.5 billion programme at this time is based on our belief that we can execute a programme of this size quickly and with confidence.""
GM last issued common stock in 1992, offering 50 million shares to raise about $2.1 billion to help carry the automaker through the worst financial crisis in its history. GM has bought back about $800 million in stock over the past two years, but has reissued shares to support employee benefit and executive compensation programmes.
GM's board also raised the dividend on its Class H shares, which are tied to the performance of its Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, to 25 cents a share from 24 cents.
The new dividends on both the Class H and automotive stocks are payable March 10 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 6.

DavidLawder,"General Motors Corp.'s 50.8 percent drop in fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations earnings was a disappointment long anticipated by Wall Street, but the automaker's strong cash generation has hopes raised for a strong performance in 1997.
Despite the earnings drop, GM's cash and marketable securities topped the $17 billion mark at year-end, up $2.5 billion from September 30, 1996 and up $6.8 billion from a year earlier.  
Although $1 billion of GM's fourth quarter cash increase came from a tax refund, analysts said the $1.5 billion increase in cash from strike-marred operations was impressive.
""It's a good news bad news quarter,"" said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. ""It suggests that if 1997 is normal and largely free of strikes, it ought to be another good year for cash generation.""
GM's fourth quarter North American production volume, mauled by strikes and new model launches, fell 11.4 percent, resulting in a $124 million North American loss, compared to a year earlier profit of $603 million.  
But analysts expect GM to bounce back in 1997 with new models and robust production. And as the new product benefits that management has been promising for several years materialize, GM's 1997 profits and cash flow should swell.
J.P. Morgan analyst David Bradley estimated that GM in 1997 could wind up with $28 billion in cash at the end of 1997, including about $4.5 billion from the sale of Hughes Aircraft Co to Raytheon Corp.
That's about $15 billion above GM's cash reserve target of $13 billion, and he added that GM could make up to $12 billion of that available for stock repurchases.  
""This company could have enough cash to buy back a quarter of its shares,"" Bradley said.
GM on Monday committed to repurchasing $2.5 billion worth of stock in the next 12 months, but GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh said the automaker wants to complete that quickly and ""revisit"" the stock buyback issue.
Nonetheless, GM shares fell 1-1/8 to 60-3/4, reflecting profit taking on the stock's climb from the last month, earnings that were roughly in line with expectations  and continued market disappointment that GM did not announce a bigger stock buyback program.  
""I think the disappointment of yesterday was not counterbalanced by positive surprises today,"" said Prudential Securities analyst Philip Fricke.
GM reported that its fourth quarter net income from continuing operations, which included a host of extraordinary items, came to $786 million, or $0.92 a share, down from $1.6 billion, or $1.95 a share, a year earlier.
The results also included weaker profits in Europe, which is plagued with a slumping market. Earnings from International Operations, long GM's standout performer, will likely be flat or declining next year, putting more pressure on GM's North American operations.
Fricke said 1997 is a ""show and tell"" year for that must reveal steady improvements in the automaker's vehicle profit margins.
""What will be the telling factor is whether the improvement in operating income goes way beyond what can be explained by higher production volumes,"" he said.
To accomplish that, GM's new cars and trucks must be a hit with consumers and help reverse the automaker's long-term slide in U.S. market share. GM ended 1996 with about 31 percent of the U.S. market, down from 32.4 percent in 1995.
""GM has to make believers out of people as far as market share goes,"" added Healy. ""If they don't gain market share this year, I don't know if they ever will.""

EdnaFernandes,"U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it would cut 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant near Liverpool, northwest England, or almost one third of the workforce, through a redundancy programme.
Ford's British operations said that the Halewood plant would not build the planned new model of the Escort car, due in 1999.
Production of the new model is likely to transfer to continental European factories in Spain and Germany.
However, Ford held out the possibility of Halewood becoming the European source of a planned new vehicle, which is still only a concept at this stage. It added that Halewood would continue to make the current Escort model through 2000.
""The actions we have announced today at Halewood assembly operations give the plant a realistic future, with an exciting new vehicle in the medium term, subject to approval and performance objectives being achieved,"" said David Gorman, European vehicle operations manager for Ford.
""We have had to take these steps to ensure our manned capacity is in line with our forecasts for sales,"" he said.
Local Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament David Alton told Reuters he had spoken to Ford, which said the jobs would be lost through voluntary redundancy. He said Halewood was in the running to be the European manufacturing site for a new vehicle, possibly in the family saloon range.
""There's some good news in what they say as well -- that they're looking at Halewood as the probable European site for a planned new vehicle,"" Alton said.
The proposed job cuts will reduce Halewood's workforce to just over 3,000, compared with a peak of 14,000 in the 1960s.
Management met trade union representatives on Thursday morning to discuss the cuts.
Workers expressed anger as they entered the factory, blaming ""flexible"" British labour laws and its opt-out from the European Union's Social Chapter, which sets out minimum working conditions in other EU countries.
""I can give you one reason why the job cuts are here. The Social Chapter,"" said production line group leader Phil Gornall.
""In Germany, if Ford closes its plant there, it has to pay its people 18 months pay in compensation. In the UK, we've got no Social Chapter, it's easier to shut us down,"" he said.
Larry Brook of the MSF union added: ""Britain is the cheapest place to dump labour. We are fighting for the future of Halewood.""
Even if a new family saloon is built at Halewood from the late 1990s, the plant would still have excess capacity, car industry experts said.
Production of the new Escort is now likely to be undertaken in Ford's plants in Valencia, Spain, and Saarlouis, Germany.
Professor Garyl Rhys, a car industry expert at Cardiff University, said Halewood, now a model of industrial relations, was paying for the  ""bad old days"" of the 1960s and 1970s, when the British car industry had a bad strike record.
""Because of the problems at Halewood and a number of other car plants in Britain, there was a reluctance to use them as sources for exports...You couldn't guarantee deliveries because of interruptions to production because of strikes,"" he said.
As a result, Halewood produced mostly for the home market.
That was fine when the Escort had 11 or 12 percent of the British market, as in the 1980s.
But by 1996 the Escort's market share had fallen to six percent and Halewood produced 110,000 cars rather than the 220,000 that an 11 percent share would require.
Ford cars were, however, the three biggest sellers in Britain in 1996, with the Escort ranked number two behind the smaller Fiesta and ahead of the Mondeo.
The Liverpool area has a higher than average jobless rate and one in three people is unemployed on some of the housing estates near the plant. Union leaders pledged to fight the cuts.

EdnaFernandes,"Northern England's glittering record of inward investment was tarnished this week by news of 1,300 jobs being axed at Ford Motor Co's Halewood plant, denting the region's record of attracting foreign firms.
Cheap local labour, flexible employment rules and government laws to keep trade unions on a tight leash have all combined to entice foreign investors into northern England.
The long list includes companies like Japan's Nissan Motor Co, Germany's Siemens, South Korea's Samsung Co and General Motor Co's British unit Vauxhall.
Prime Minister John Major said the cuts went against the trend. Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke was more philosophical, saying on Thursday: ""You can't win them all.""
Professor Charles Bean of the London School of Economics, said Major's decision to stay out of the European Union's Social Chapter employment protection meant: ""We have low firing costs.
""So foreign companies are more likely to create jobs here when times are good and axe them in the UK first when times get tough.""
But business chiefs in other northern regions were keen to play up the investment bonanza they have enjoyed.
Northern Development Co spokeswoman Christine Kennedy said in an interview: ""Foreign investment has provided the building blocks for a regeneration in the north,"" after traditional industries like mining and shipbuilding declined.
Local business leaders in the north west of England also stressed that the Ford move was a one-off set against a good track record of inward investment within the region as a whole.
Inward', the north west's corporate development body, said that 2,600 jobs were created in the region in the financial year 1995/96.
Thirty one companies invested capital expenditure of 117.3 million pounds ($196.2 million) in the north west of England including the television shopping channel QVC which will create 1,100 jobs in Knowsley, Liverpool. That figure is seen doubling by 1998.
Liverpool Chamber of Commerce policy executive Peter Rigby, told Reuters that the discovery of oil and gas in Liverpool Bay was another bonus which could give the region a slice of up to 2,000 jobs from oil companies operating in the area.
Merseyside qualifies for an EU grant of 630 million pounds to boost employment because its GDP is one of Europe's poorest at 73 percent of the European average.
Rigby admits that Ford's job cuts were a blow, coupled with news that Manchester airport beaten Liverpool in getting the go-ahead for a second runway for its airport. This dashed hopes of 20,000 Liverpool airport-related jobs being created in construction, support staff and service industries.
Manchester airport will benefit instead, creating an estimated 50,000 new jobs.
Hardest hit in the region is the small Merseyside community of Speke, where the Halewood factory is based. It has one of the highest unemployment levels in Britain and has failed to enjoy a foreign-led renaissance.
Jobless rates in Speke already run as high as 39 percent in some council estates, compared to more than 11 percent in Liverpool and 6.7 percent nationally.
The Ford job cuts are seen triggering up to 1,200 job losses elsewhere in supplier anmd service industries.
The Speke community is seeing other businesses like banks and supermarkets shut down and move away as employers pull out.
One resident, Nicky McDonagh said after the Ford news: ""The place is bad enough as it is -- it will just lead to more crime. Unemployment's already high -- most children leave school with no job prospects. I just want to get out now."" ($1=.5979 Pound)

EdnaFernandes,"Embattled Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel Plc assured investors on Monday that the financial fallout from last November's fire would not hit its debt rescue plan or derail long-term growth.
""The board...believes that the November fire should not have any significant effect on the long-term financial performance of the company, nor will there be any need to review the financial restructuring plan,"" said Eurotunnel in a statement.
The blaze swept through one of the cross-channel tunnels, causing a partial shutdown and reduced services. But Eurotunnel gave evidence that sales had survived the fire, with passenger numbers sharply up and the outlook for 1997 encouraging.
Richard Hannah, analyst at UBS, said: ""The fact that the refinancing will not have to be restructured is the key message for investors.""
A special shareholder meeting had been due in April to consider the debt refinancing, which was clinched in October. But Eurotunnel said it had now delayed that to June when full services would resume once tunnel repairs had been completed.
Eurotunnel said its banking syndicate had used the delay to ask the remaining syndicate of bankers to extend the debt standstill arrangement to December. It began in September 1995 and runs for 18 months.
Eurotunnel chairman Patrick Ponsolle also said he hoped to agree details of the debt deal with its steering group of banks before March. Ponsolle was speaking to Reuters before a news briefing on the year's outlook in Folkestone, England.
In the first major trading review since the fire, Eurotunnel reported that unaudited estimated turnover for 1996 was 450 million pounds ($752.5 million), up from 300 million in 1995.
The group said the sales growth was achieved ""despite a substantial loss of revenue in the last seven weeks (of 1996)"".
Thirteen million passengers travelled through the tunnel last year by the Le Shuttle car service or the Eurostar passenger trains, up from eight million the previous year.
The board described the outlook for 1997 as encouraging as the cross-channel ferry industry was cutting capacity in a move which holds out the prospect of firmer pricing.
Eurotunnel believes that once full services resume by June it should be able to raise its market share in the second half.
""This market share should be comparable to, if not higher than, autumn 1996, and revenues at the end of this year should be higher than at the end of 1996,"" it said.
""As expected, Eurotunnel has provided a morale booster,"" said Hannah. Growth in sales was in line with expectations. Passenger numbers had been expected to increase after a change of ownership in the Eurostar passenger train service last April.
It was taken over by London and Continental Railways with the aim of raising sales dramatically.
Looking at a breakdown of the latest Eurotunnel traffic data, Eurostar increased passenger numbers by 67 percent to 4.86 million for the full year, and by 69 percent for the 11 months up to the November fire which led to a temporary closure.
Le Shuttle car tourist traffic rose 70 percent to 2.07 million cars in 1996, with bus traffic up 148 percent to 57,692 coaches. Le Shuttle freight traffic was up 33 percent to 519,003 trucks for the year.
Eurotunnel shares edged up 1/2 pence to 76-1/2 in London and rose 10 centimes to 7.00 francs in Paris.

EdnaFernandes,"Japanese car giant Nissan Motor Co geared up to expand European sales on Tuesday by announcing a new 215 million pound ($357 million) investment in its plant at Sunderland in north east England to build a new model.
The move will create 800 jobs at Nissan UK and is expected to create a further 2,700 jobs in British supplier firms.
The news came just days after U.S. rival Ford Motor Co said it was axing 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant in Liverpool, north west England because of over-capacity in the world market and to stem painful losses in Europe.
In stark contrast, Nissan will create the extra jobs at the north east England plant by adding a third model to the production line at Nissan Motor (UK) Ltd (NMUK). The investment will be for production equipment such as moulds for the car.
Japan's second-biggest carmaker said that from the year 2000 it will produce an extra 100,000 cars a year in the mid-price Pulsar range, called the Almera, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.
The decision to build a third model in Europe was the subject of an internal review at Nissan for some time. The review was led by European vice-president and head of UK operations Ian Gibson who worked his way up from the factory floor.
Gibson, chief executive of Nissan UK, told Reuters in an interview that the UK plant had beaten off internal competition to build the model in Japan by proving Sunderland could produce the model to the ""same quality, and with similar efficiency and productivity levels as the plant in Japan.""
""It is a considerable vote of confidence (for Sunderland),"" he said in a BBC television interview .
""It's a successful plant and it has an extremely successful workforce and they have won the business,"" he added.
British Trade and Industry minister Ian Lang welcomed the move, saying, ""This latest decision by Nissan marks a significant development in their presence in Europe and underlines the attractions of the UK as a place to manufacture.""
Explaining the logic behind the decision, which is in sharp contrast to Ford's job cuts, Arthur Maher, analyst at LMC International, said: ""There are two factors which are driving this decision for Nissan. One is economic and the other is political,"" he said.
""First, in the past Nissan has been hit by a high yen (since declined) -- a factor which they took seriously. They probably believed that it would remain a firm currency. The UK was also a cheap place to build cars for Europe, offering good productivity,"" he added.
""Second, politically. For a long time Japan has been held back from restrictive markets like Italy and France which have tight import quotas,"" Maher said.
He concluded that if Nissan wanted to break into these markets after 2000, when all export limits on Japanese car imports into Europe are lifted, it made sense to build locally to make the car more acceptable to European customers.
The British plant is a springboard into that potential market. Nissan has three percent of the European market.
The potential for Nissan to expand its market share is seen as greater than for the more dominant Ford which has seen sluggish sales in the region.
John Lawson, analyst at Salomon Brothers, said he believed that Nissan also had cheaper production costs than Ford in Britain because its salaries are 10 to 15 percent lower.
""Also despite the rise in the value of the pound, there is still a lot to be said for the decision to manufacture in the UK. Japan has much higher labour costs and then there is the shipping and tariff costs,"" said Lawson.
The Nissan Europe technology centre in Britain will be responsible for development of the new car. The decision follows recent Nissan announcements that it will start building diesel engines in Sunderland in 1997, and will launch an estate version of the Primera built in Sunderland in 1998, creating 150 jobs.

EdnaFernandes,"Japanese car giant Nissan Motor Co geared up to expand European sales on Tuesday by announcing a new 215 million pound ($357 million) investment in its British plant at Sunderland in north east England to build a new model.
The move will create 800 jobs at Nissan UK and is expected to create a further 2,700 jobs in British supplier firms.
The news came just days after U.S. rival Ford Motor Co said it was axing 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant in Liverpool, north west England because of over-capacity in the world market and to stem painful losses in Europe.
In stark contrast, Nissan will create the extra jobs at the north east England plant by adding a third model to the production line at Nissan Motor (UK) Ltd (NMUK). The investment will be for production equipment such as moulds for the car.
Japan's second-biggest carmaker said it will produce models in the Pulsar range, called the Almera in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, at the plant from 2000.
The decision to build a third model in Europe has been the subject of an internal review at Nissan for sime time, headed up by its European vice-president and the head of UK operations Ian Gibson, a man who worked his way up from the production line.
Gibson, chief executive of Nissan UK, told BBC television, ""It is a considerable vote of confidence (for Sunderland).
""It's a successful plant and it has an extremely successful workforce and they have won the business. All the business for the new car will be new business to Europe because the car is built at present in Japan and shipped over here, so all those purchases will be incremental business,"" he said.
Britain's Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang welcomed the move, saying, ""This latest decision by Nissan marks a significant development in their presence in Europe and underlines the attractions of the UK as a place to manufacture.

EdnaFernandes,"British defence to electronics giant General Electric Company signalled a key shift away from the management legacy of ex-chief Lord Weinstock this week by giving itself a leaner structure, analysts said on Thursday.
Zafar Khan, analyst at SocGen, said ""GEC has created a flatter structure, with divisional heads now reporting to Simpson directly creating a more modern-day business structure. There are more direct lines of control.""
George Simpson, who succeeded Weinstock as managing director last September, announced on Wednesday GEC would halve the number of its corporate divisions to five key business units -- GEC Alsthom, GEC Marconi, GPT, GEC USA and the industrial group of businesses.
The newly separated industrial group includes the industrial apparatus unit.
GEC also created a central committee with representatives from the key activities of finance, legal affairs, strategic planning, personnel affairs, marketing and technical issues.
Analysts said the move brought GEC's corporate structure up to date and created a leaner and clearer chain of command.
The key new change is GEC's decision to group together the main U.S. businesses -- the medical equipment manufacturer Picker International, petrol pump maker Gilbarco and printer maker Videojet.
One analyst said the company had informed him that the regrouping did not necessarily mean that industrials was being separated off for sale.
""It has indicated that the split in two (of the U.S. and industrials) was due to (former deputy managing director Malcolm) Bates resigning. The strategic review is still six to seven months down the line so GEC is damping down speculation for now,"" he said.
Even so, market watchers believe that industrial apparatus and consumer electronics are two likely candidates for divestment.
Andy Crispin at SocGen added that these were businesses with ""low margins and tough markets"" making them sell-off targets.
GEC finance director David Newlands told Reuters at its half year stage last December that the group had received a spate of offers which were mostly above book value.
Simpson stamped his first mark on the company at the half year stage by announcing a 160 million pounds ($261.5 million) restructuring charge and the possibility of up to 1,000 job cuts.
GEC shares have turned more sprightly since Simpson took the helm. The company's shares are approaching a two-year high at 411 pence, up 2-1/2p on Wednesday's close, compared to 271 pence per share in January 1995.

EdnaFernandes,"Hanson, Britain's most famous conglomerate in the throes of a four-way demerger, begins a new era next year as a building industry company -- inheriting the famous family name on the group's demise.
After starting out in 1950 as a fertliser maker before becoming the multi-industrial giant, Hanson will emerge from the family break-up with a legacy of low debt of around 200 million pounds ($313.4 million), lower asset values due to a recent writedown and a clutch of building material and construction firms.
The estimated 2.4 billion pounds demerger, which starts next month, will see the flotation of Millennium Chemicals and Imperial Tobacco on October 1, with The Energy Group due early next year.
Lord Hanson, group chairman, will remain on the ""New Hanson"" board and also brings his son Robert Hanson as director of corporate development, a move triggering controversy among some big investors. Andrew Dougal takes up the chief executive position.
But analysts, including UBS, warn ""New Hanson"" still faces old dangers like difficult construction markets and the future asset valuation of aggregates which represents two thirds of turnover from the ARC and Cornerstone units.
Its other units are Hanson Brick, Hanson Electrical and Grove Worlwide.
In the most recent nine-month results for Hanson, the building related businesses saw profits fall to 154 million pounds from 156 million. Turnover rose to 1.75 billion from 1.54 billion.
Despite its sales growth, the performance has been hampered by poor market conditions, particularly in Britain which has seen construction spending remain stagnant and margins pressurised.
The British housing market is also still in the doldrums, with the first flicker of recovery only just emerging.
Hanson says U.S. markets have become more vibrant, with U.S.aggregates unit Cornerstone seeing rising profits as the price of the material rose by four percent in the first nine months of the financial year.
But despite recovery in some U.S. sectors, UBS says there are still regional weak spots like California, for example.
Sentiment in the businesses was also dampened earlier this year by a cut in asset values by 2.3 billion pounds to 1.3 billion on the Cornerstone aggregates values.
UBS analysts say the future valuation of these assets will be of key concern.
Analysts have also privately voiced concern about the appointment of Hanson Junior to such a key position in the company, stating that some big investors are perturbed about his level of experience.
""The Lord may with one hand spare Hanson from the high debt levels of others (in the group), but he gives Robert Hanson with the other,"" said one analyst who requested anonymity.
But other sector watchers are more gracious in their assessment, citing the strong market position of units like UK aggregates arm ARC, seen as a first-class player.
""New Hanson's got low debt, good market positions and aims for acquisition-led growth,"" said one.
Another added that this particular company was free from the threat of environmental or legal action payouts - a worry that could afflict the group's other coal and tobacco concerns. ($1=.6382 Pound)
"
EdnaFernandes,"Stagecoach Plc, the transport group which has seen its share price rocket by 138 percent in the last year, predicted the biggest future growth coming from more acquisitions being made in the rail and bus sector overseas, its chairman told Reuters.
Brian Souter, executive chairman, added that Stagecoach's underlying gearing of 197 percent, excluding securitised debt which raises it to 567 percent, was not excessive and that the group was confident it had the financial scope to remain a deal-maker.  
""We are very comfortable about our gearing levels,"" said Souter, adding ""We would be in a position to make a major European acquisiton in the next year if needed.""
Commenting on how the group could continue to maintain its pacy growth which has helped fuel the share-fever in the stock, he said that its European ambitions had been ignited by the Swebus bus acquistion last year. Stagecoach was looking to make similar acquisitons in countries ""clustered in the region"". ""I also think there'll be overseas railways opportunities. These two will provide the biggest lump of growth in future - that's my prediction.""  
Responding to some analysts' comments about the high debt levels, Souter said the company expected to have 230 million stg in free cash in two to three years and stressed that 70 percent of its  current 830 million of total debt (including securitised loans) was fixed for seven years at 7.19 percent.
""This gearing question is an important one which we want to address with the market,"" said the chairman.
Turning to the UK bus unit, Souter said that although the group's aim to raise its share of the national market to 25 percent from 17 percent remained, it would not buy any bus companies for now because they were overpriced.  
""We are holding back on these deals because of the prices. Once the Labour (Party) is in place and we know their policies, then we can move. But for now we have a sabbatical on acquisitions in this area because of high prices and until we see what happens with the next govt.""
A UK election is due by May, with the opposition Labour Party riding high in opinion polls. Possible future takeover targets include MTL, the Liverpool bus company. ""We looked at it (MTL), Taybus and other big groups to see if they have value in them - Everything's on our shopping list,"" said the chairman.  
He said some bus company prices did not reflect the age of their fleets and ""we are not going to pay premium prices.""
The cash-cow of the group Porterbrook continues to perform well, he said. The rolling stock leasing company is expected to account for 50 percent of group profits for the full year, say analysts and Stagecoach is not arguing with that prediction.
""It has exceeded our initial expectations and we continue to be very happy with it,"" said the chairman. ""We are very comfortable with forecasts analysts are making.""
Also, Porterbrook is already in the throes of bidding for an upcoming 1.6 billion stg of orders due from the rail franchises.  
""Porterbrook has a big diet of investment in new trains in the industry, with 1.6 billion stg of new investment required under (UK passenger rail) franchise agreements within a five year period.""
""The industry has a stream of franchise decisions in the next six months and they (potential franchise customers) will place orders in next 12 months. The bulk of the 1.6 bln will be placed then,"" he said.
Stagecoach also has the South West Trains passenger rail franchise and is on the short-list for others. It said it was confident of winning at least another.

EdnaFernandes,"Stagecoach Plc, the star performer of Britain's transport sector whose shares soared 138 percent in a year, promised on Friday more bumper growth this year fuelled by acquisitions overseas.
Outlining its strategy for 1997, executive chairman Brian Souter said the Scottish-based buses-to-railways group had not run out of steam and still could deliver growing returns.
He also tried to dampen concern about the size of group debt, with total gearing at 567 percent, saying it still had the financial scope to remain a deal-maker.
""We are very comfortable about our gearing levels. We would be in a position to make a major European acquisition in the next year if needed,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
The fast-growing group is set to target rail and bus firms in the Nordic region as well as examining the Pacific Rim.
Stagecoach, which started as a brother and sister team running the local bus company in Perth, Scotland, is now Britain's biggest transport operator having acquired privatised railway operations in southwest England, a rolling stock company and bus operations in England and Sweden.
On buying market share in the British bus market -- Stagecoach has 17 percent with the aim of reaching 25 percent -- Souter said he wanted to wait until the election due by May, which the opposition Labour Party is strongly-placed to win.
""We are holding back on these deals because of the prices,"" he said. ""Once the Labour (Party) is in place and we know their policies, then we can move. But for now we have a sabbatical on acquisitions in this area.""
On debt, he said: ""This gearing question is an important one which we want to address with the market.""
The 567 percent gearing includes securitised debt and falls to 197 percent once securitised loans are stripped out.
Stagecoach expects to have 230 million pounds in free cash in two to three years and stressed that 70 percent of its current 830 million ($1.36 billion) of total debt, including securitised loans, was fixed for seven years at 7.19 percent.
The Porterbrook UK rolling stock unit could turn in 50 percent of group profit, say analysts, a figure the company does not argue with. ""It has exceeded our initial expectations and we continue to be very happy with it,"" said Souter. ""We are very comfortable with forecasts analysts are making.""
Souter said the performance of the shares, which rocketed from 274 pence in December 1995 to the current level of 799-1/2, reflected the quality of underlying earnings.
Stagecoach said it ran all its businesses against a ""worst case scenario"" set of conditions: a market slump, interest rates hiked to 15 percent and an eight percent fall in passenger traffic. Souter said all businesses remained viable.
""I'm not saying our business is risk or recession free but these are great quality earnings.""
""Political and regulatory uncertainty are the only worries, but we're not as uncomfortable as we were six months ago.""
There are longer-term concerns about earnings once its South West Trains passenger rail franchise ends in 2003 and the termination of some Porterbrook train leasing deals around the same time. That would strip out a chunk of guaranteed earnings.
But for the nearer term, the bonanza looks set to keep running, with analysts predicting average year profits to April 30 at 98.2 million pounds, rising to 154 million thereafter.
Its last set of annual profits were 43.6 million. That growth will stem from Porterbrook and Swebus. One analyst said: ""Last year it was the best stock in the transport sector, so there can't be enormous upside left.
""But Mr Souter does have quite a big fan club in the City. He has very good business judgement and he's a specialist at investing in high-growth businesses sold off by the government at the wrong price."" ($1=.6119 Pound)

EdnaFernandes,"Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson Plc set the date for the final stage of its ambitious four-way demerger on Tuesday with the announcement that its Energy Group division will be spun off on February 24.
Energy Group, which is mulling a string of acquisitions in Britain and America, said it had started talks with a U.S. power marketing company.
The demerger, which is subject to shareholder approval, will give shareholders one Energy share for every 10 existing Hanson shares held. Hanson shareholders will be asked to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on February 21.
Once Energy is split off as a separate company, to be listed in London and New York, the rump Hanson group will consist of a clutch of building firms.
""We are all very enthusiastic about the future of Energy and new Hanson and are convinced that both will benefit from enhanced focus on operations, profitability and future growth prospects,"" chairman Lord Hanson said.
The first two demergers of Britain's Imperial Tobacco and U.S.-quoted Millennium Chemicals took place last October.
Energy, which will be large enough to rank inside Britain's top 100 blue chips and the Fortune 500 in the U.S., is the last to be split off.
Its new management team is led by Derek Bonham, executive chairman, with two joint chief executives to run operations at the main businesses -- Peabody mining and Eastern, the British electricity division.
Bonham told a press briefing the group planned to target a number of acquisitions, particularly in the U.S., and admitted entering into ""exclusive and confidential"" talks with a U.S. power marketing company, subject to due diligence.
It is also examining generating deals in the U.S. and Britian, it said.
Peabody chief executive Irl Engelhardt told a press briefing that the coal group could use its knowledge of the U.S. market to help Energy exploit opportunities there.
Group finance director Eric Anstee said the group would ""take the cash generation of the coal and network businesses and use it where we see future growth in earnings -- the growing power sector"".
Eastern generated a total of 354 million pounds ($571 million) in cash flow in the year ended September 30, he said.
Energy, which owns Eastern, Britain's fourth largest electricity generator, said that worldwide demand for energy is expected to rise 34 to 46 percent between 1993 and 2010.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, world electricity output is expected to grow 63 percent to 2010. Coal and gas will account for 41 percent and 17 percent of that generation level by 2010.
Energy, which is being sold with 1.4 billion pounds of debt, sees this, deregulation in world markets and privatisation as the key opportunities for the group.
Investor roadshows are being planned on both sides of the Atlantic, with 35 percent of Hanson's shares held in the U.S.
The group's annual turnover in the year to September 30, 1996 was 3.6 billion pounds, with pre-exceptional profits of 446 million pounds. Total assets are 5.7 billion pounds. ($1=.6199 Pound)

EdnaFernandes,"Britain was a step closer to completing the privatisation of passenger rail services on Thursday after announcing the preferred bidders for two more franchises which helped send the companies' shares soaring.
The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) said Great Western Holdings Ltd had been chosen as the preferred bidder for the North West Regional Railways franchise in northwest England.
Existing management and employees own 51 percent of the bid group, with FirstBus and 3i venture capital owning 24.5 percent each.
The Thameslink franchise was awarded to GOVIA which comprises of Go-Ahead Group Plc and French transport group VIA-GTI.
That leaves just three of the total 25 franchises to be awarded ahead of the deadline for the British election due by May 1997. Apart from the franchise for routes in Central England, the remaining deals are ScotRail and North East Regional Rail.
The franchise sales will completes the controversial privatisation of Britain's rail industry which began in 1995 and included the sell-off of rail infrastructure under Railtrack and the sale of the three rolling stock leasing companies.
Go-Ahead's commercial director Chris Moyes welcomed the news and told Reuters the line had huge potential because it provided a link from the financial district of London to Gatwick and Luton airports.
He said finalisation of the deal could add 100 million pounds ($162 million) of extra revenue to Go-Ahead's figures.
""We aim to capitalise on our existing commuter traffic and improve the links to the airports. There is enormous scope,"" he said pointing to the example of the fast-link Gatwick Express service from Victoria which serves the West London travellers.
Opraf also announced that a revised shortlist for Central Trains had been drawn up, cutting the orignal list of five to National Express Group and Straightforward Lines which contains FirstBus and the existing management team.
FirstBus chairman, Trevor Smallwood, said whoever won the Central deal, which covers routes in central England, could see revenues of around 70 million pounds.
His company must now make renewed presentations against National Express in a fight to the finish.
A final decision is expected in the next two weeks when financial details of each deal will be revealed including the service, investment and subsidy levels for the franchise term.
The latest round of winners saw their shares roar ahead in celebration, with Go-Ahead leading the pack with a 36 pence rise to 515 by the close. National Express was up 26 pence at 547 and FirstBus was up 12 1/2 pence at 241.
The sector has seen spectacular growth in share prices in the past year as more bus operators have moved into railways, taking advantage of the opportunities opened up by privatisation.

EdnaFernandes,"Go-Ahead Group Plc, the UK transport company, and its French partner VIA-GTI are set to be announced as the preferred bidder for the Thameslink passenger rail franchise, industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.
An official announcement is expected from the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) imminently.
The joint venture, which is 65 percent owned by Go-Ahead and 35 percent by the VIA-GTI, is called GOVIA.  
Go-Ahead has already won the Thames rail franchise and GOVIA had been shortlisted for Thameslink, as well as ScotRail and Regional Railways North East.
The Thameslink rail franchise runs to Luton and Gatwick airports through the financial district of London and is seen as having great potential as a fast-link to these major UK airports.
Go-Ahead is a bus and rail operator. As well as becoming a player in the rail franchise market, it also has around eight percent of the UK bus market, with fleets running in London, Oxford and the north east of England.
The group has been among a number of UK bus companies to move into rail, fuelling growth in earnings, which has triggered a strong rise in its share price.

EdnaFernandes,"British airports operator BAA Plc is expected to show taxable profits continuing to climb when it reports third quarter and nine-month results on Monday as the number of people travelling by air travel continues to rise.
Analysts predict that pretax profits for the nine months to December 31 will come in at between 392 million stg and 400 from 374 million pounds last time.  
Passenger traffic at its airports, which include the country's two biggest hubs of London Heathrow and Gatwick, rose 4.4 percent in the nine months to 76.62 million passengers.
But the company's prospects have been overshadowed by fears that Britain's opposition Labour Party could include BAA in its hit list for the windfall tax, which it has vowed to impose on former state-owned utilities should it win the election.
Labour says a certain number of utilities such as the water and power companies were sold off too cheaply by the Conservative government and led to ""fat cat"" executives overpaying themselves and their shareholders with the proceeds.  
BAA refuses to countenance the prospect, saying it has done everything the utilities should have done since it was privatised in 1987, investing in the business including plans to build a giant fifth passenger terminal at London Heathrow.
""We are not a utility, we are not a fat cat, we have not paid either special dividends or returned money to shareholders or made any mega acquisitions to get rid of our money,"" BAA's finance director Russell Walls said last November.
BAA reported pre-tax profits rose only 3.4 percent to 304 million stg in the six months to September 30 and earnings were up just 3.3 percent to 22.2 pence a share.  
But it said underlying pretax profits were up 10.5 percent and earnings up by 11.1 percent because it made a nine million stg exceptional gain in the comparable period a year ago.
It was also phasing out seasonal fluctuations in airport user charges, which had reduced income by 11 million stg in the first half but would be recovered in the second half.
With airport landing and passenger handling charges regulated under a five-year pricing formula, BAA is concentrating on trying to boost retail revenues from the shopping arcades it has built at most of its terminals.  
First half net retail income rose 10.7 percent to 224.5 million stg, with passengers spending an average of 4.20 stg each, 7.2 percent more than a year ago.
Total group revenue including retail was up 6.3 percent at 742 million stg. Income from airport user charges increased by 1.8 percent to 283 million stg. Revenue from property rose 7.7 percent to 112 million stg.

EdnaFernandes,"Crucial talks between the British and U.S. governments on clinching an open skies pact to free the transatlantic airline market were postponed for two weeks on Monday due to the illness of a senior British negotiator.
The talks had been due to kick off in Washington on Tuesday, with representatives from the British and U.S. governments as well as the main transatlantic carriers.
But a spokesman for the British government said: ""Our lead official is in hospital so the meeting has been cancelled. The talks have been postponed for a fortnight.""
News of the eleventh-hour grounding of talks came as the European Commission kicked off a separate series of private hearings in Brussels into the proposed British Airways and American Airlines alliance, which is conditional on an open skies pact being clinched.
British and U.S. carriers expressed regret that the Anglo-U.S. talks had been delayed. But sources reiterated that this round of talks had not been expected to deliver a final deal.
""It's not damaging. The two sides had been talking informally anyway and this round was never billed as the breakthrough round,"" one U.S. airline spokesman said. ""It was meant to deal with more boring issues like ground handling.""
The two sides are believed to have been inching closer, but Scott Yohe, senior vice-president of government affairs at Delta Air Lines Inc , told Reuters he believed full agreement was not possible in the current round. He said a deal is likely to emerge in subsequent talks.
But a number of other major hurdles need to be cleared. First the British government wants to try to link the open skies talks with the BA/AA alliance. The U.S. wants to keep the talks and alliance approval as two distinct issues.
Britain is still waiting for its competition watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, to give a final verdict on the alliance after receiving responses from the airline industry.
In particular, airlines are waiting for a clarification on how BA should divest itself of 168 landing slots at London's Heathrow airport -- a condition for the BA/AA deal to be cleared by the Office of Fair Trading.
""Buying/selling of slots is fundamental to any (open skies) deal,"" said one U.S. airline spokesman.
Whether BA can sell them or must give them away remains a grey area. Britain says the decision lies with the government, but the European Commission says it has final jurisdiction and claims that selling slots is banned under EU law.
Another issue within the open skies framework is the argument by the British government for some protection for smaller airlines taking the full brunt of competition under an open skies regime.
Britain is trying to secure a dispute reconciliation procedure. This is believed to be for the benefit of players like Virgin Atlantic, the transatlantic carrier owned by entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group .
Another complicating factor is the chance of a British election being announced in the coming weeks, which could put the talks on the backburner.
With the opposition Labour Party riding high in opinion polls, one industry insider said that if there was a change of government ""there is the possibility that Labour will want to start from scratch.""

EdnaFernandes,"BAA Plc, the British airports group behind Europe's biggest hub at London Heathrow, reported a 6.2 percent rise in nine month pretax profits on Monday as the group remained on a steady course of profitability for the year.
Pretax profits for the period ended December 31 were 397 million pounds ($636.5 million), with total revenue up to 1.06 billion pounds versus 987 million pounds.
In the nine months 76.6 million passengers travelled through BAA's airports which also include Gatwick and Stansted in London.
Sir John Egan, chief executive, said the figures represented ""strong performance across the board"".
Airport and traffic charge revenue stood at 385 million pounds, up 5.5 percent. Retailing revenue was 475 million, up 10 percent resulting in net retail income of 331 million, up 11 percent and property income rose 8.4 percent to 168 million pounds.
The solid looking set of figures failed to spark the market. Shares were down seven pence at 525 pence per share.
""It was a steady result but nothing terribly exciting,"" one senior dealer said. ""The overall market is a bit weak this morning and the shares are just reflecting that weakness.""
Commenting on the outlook, Egan welcomed the greater certainty which followed the Civil Aviation Authority's publication of its regulatory review for the coming five years.
That review said there was no need for BAA to divest any of its aiports in the UK and recommended a price control of RPI (retail price index) minus three percent.
The price control applies to its airport service charges, but around half of BAA'c sales now come from the shopping malls installed inside its airports.
BAA is also moving overseas, submitting bids to run overseas airports.
In a separate development, BAA group finance director Russell Walls said it had decided to cut back its stake in a bid group to run three Australian airports.
""We are cutting our stake in agreement with our other partners. The bid had too high a foreign content,"" he said. But Walls denied there was any prompt from the Australian government to reduce its dominance in the consortium, which includes Australian fund managers.
Bids have been put in for airports in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. ($1=.6237 Pound)

EdnaFernandes,"Britain's opposition Labour Party outlined its blueprint for transport on Tuesday pledging no sell-off of the London Underground system, a partnership with the private sector on investment and a review of rail and bus regulation.
Labour leader Tony Blair kicked off the proceedings at an Industry Forum conference on transport by backing a public-private partnership to inject more investment into the cash-strapped metro system.
""It would offer Londoners a way between the status quo and dogmatic wholesale privatisation,"" he said.
The theme of partnership was emphasised by Blair and shadow transport secretary Andrew Smith who has shifted sharply away from the more interventionist policy approach of his predecessor Clare Short, according to transport industry figures.
Labour's revised transport vision promised tougher regulation, but no longer spoke of reversing the rail sell-off.
Instead, Smith said he envisaged using the private sector to invest in track maintenance, signalling, new trains and tunnel maintenance through long-term agreements for the underground.
On the overland rail network, Labour said it would be pushing policies which resulted in less road building and more traffic management.
This would be underscored by initiatives to tempt more passengers out of their cars and onto rail and buses. But Blair said the party did not want to ""demonise"" cars.
""I want to see an end to the debate couched in terms of road versus rail'. I am not interested in demonising the motor car. The focus of government policy needs to be offering people attractive alternatives to using their car. The task has to be getting a sustainable balance in car use,"" he told the conference.
As part of its effort to beef up the transport system as a viable alternative to cars, Labour promised a review of the regulation of buses and rail.
On rail, Smith criticised privatised infrastructure company Railtrack Plc for not meeting its investment obligations.
""As a natural monopoly whose performance is critical for the whole system, Railtrack must be held to account for the quality and effectiveness as well as the financial value of its investment programme and its property disposals. The first call on those should be for investment,"" said Smith.
Labour -- which leads in pinion polls ahead of a general election which must be held by May -- plans a four-point plan to move more freight onto rail and off roads.
As part of the that plan, Railtrack would be given more of a responsibility to develop freight business under a proposed code of conduct.
This would require Railtrack to provide information and introduce procedures for dealing with new freight business requests as part of a general obligaiton to promote develop freight. This would be enforced by the rail regulator, said Labour.
The freight plan also includes safeguarding of sites for depots under planning guidlines and raising safety and emission standards for road haulage. On regulation, Labour said said there was a need for a new framework for buses and the beefing up of the rail regulator's powers.
On compeititon law, Labour would launch a review to see whether changes are needed to allow co-operation between bus companies on issues like ticketing and time-tabling where it can benefit customers - an issue the industry has lobbied on.
Labour said Britain's lack of an integrated transport policy was already costing it 20 billion pounds ($32.07 billion) per annum, according to a survey from the Confederation of British Industry.

EdnaFernandes,"Britain could raise between 600 million and 1.5 billion pounds ($960 million to $2.4 billion) in net proceeds from the sale of the London Underground rail network, Steven Norris, a former transport minister now working on the Conservative Party election manifesto, said on Wednesday.
Norris, who is spearheading the ruling party's election campaign for London and the south-east of England, told Reuters he also believed the government is strongly examining the option of fare and service standard controls for the tube network.
In a telephone interview, Norris, who has been involved informally with government studies into a possible sale of the network, known as the tube, said he understood the sale proceeds figure excluded the cost of funding necessary investments.
The gross proceeds figure was put at between 1.4 billion and 2.5 billion pounds, he said. In the run up to Britain's general election, which must be held by May 22, London Underground has been turned into a ""political football"", government sources say.
As politicians among the ruling Conservatives and also the opposition Labour party believe that Londoners' votes may ride on the tube in more ways than one, there is great pressure on the government to submit a compelling case to the public.
Norris said he believed the government was also looking at a way of safeguarding service levels, much as the Department of Transport has already done with the national rail network.
A government source also told Reuters earlier that fare controls were on the cards under sell-off plans -- a crucial tactic for commuters who are likely to fear that higher fares would otherwise follow from privatisation.
""The key selling point of (national overground) rail privatisation to consumers was provision of fare controls and the need to maintain existing levels of service,"" the source told Reuters. ""So it is unlikely that those would not be maintained under the London Underground sale.""
The government source concluded, ""In a pre-election situation the government has to have reasons to do it which are presentable in the public eye.""
The comments came the day after opposition Labour leader Tony Blair, ahead in electoral opinion polls, said he was committed to keeping the tube in public hands and revitalising it through private sector investment.
Norris slammed Labour's plans to encourage private sector investment into the tube to maintain track, signalling, tunnels and for new trains as inadequate.
He said private finance projects in the underground worth 1.0 billion pounds were already underway.
The sale options being looked at by the government include a full scale sale, or selling the franchises to run individual tube lines, he said.
This is seen as a feasible route because the network currently runs each line as a separate business, with its own fleet of rolling stock. But Norris said franchises would have to be long enough to allow franchisees to recoup necessary investment in the network.
The network, some of which is more than a hundred years old, built in the Victorian era, faces a government budget freeze of 500 million pounds per annum in the next financial year.
That government subsidy will be slashed to 350 million in the year after and 150 million for the year after that.
A spokesman for the Department of Transport said the shortfall should be filled by an expected increase in the system's operating surplus (or profit) which is currently at 100 million pounds and seen growing up to 300 million.

EdnaFernandes,"AMEC Plc, the British building and engineering group, saw first half pretax profits double on Thursday and pledged to reward investors with final dividend growth in the second half after freezing the latest payout.
Pretax profits for the six months to June 30 rocketed to 12.1 million pounds ($18.96 million) from 6.1 million. Sales were 1.32 billion versus 1.13 billion.
AMEC chief executive Peter Mason told Reuters ""We would hope to improve the dividend at the year end,"" after freezing the interim payout at 1.5 pence per share.
Mason explained the reason for the conservative payout:""On balance we felt it was better to have a dividend which was covered rather than try for a small increase. But we will deal with it properly at the year end.""
The chief was confident that profits would be better than last year after announcing in the results statement that turnover should hit the targeted 2.75 billion pounds.
AMEC's shares were up 2 1/2 pence higher at 98 at 1104 GMT.
The AMEC chief also told Reuters that as part of his strategic review, kicked off seven months ago, he aimed to boost the group's international sales through acquisitions and partnerships.
Mason has targeted raising overseas sales to 50 percent of total turnover from the current 30 percent in the long term.
""All options are open,"" he said, adding that the preferred route for expansion is through partnerships and small acquisitions.
""I see no merit in acquisitions in basic building and civil engineering businesses, but I want companies offering value-added technology and design,"" he said. Several deals are already under discussion.
AMEC, which fought off a hostile takeover from Norway's Kvaerner which still holds 26 percent of its shares, had said earlier this year that a number of companies in South East Asia were interested in buying up this stake in bits to cement business links.
This move was seen as a route to expanding sales in the region.
Turning to the interim's divisional results - mechanical and electrical sales rose 20 percent.
Building and civil engineering sales rose 28 percent, despite severe problems in the West German market hit by low infrastructure spending and sluggish conditions.
As a result AMEC is seeking to transfer some of its resources to the brisker East German market.
Process and energy returned to profit in 1996, but Mason predicts stronger figures in 1997 once the rationalisation benefits kick in. Housing sales were up 11 percent.

EricAuchard,"Shares of 3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp slid on Monday as prospects dimmed for a new suitor emerging to rescue Robotics shareholders unhappy with the proposed merger of the two firms, traders said.
The agreement binding 3Com and Robotics to the $7.3-billion merger, announced last Wednesday, requires either party to pay up to $160 million if the deal falls through, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission 8-K filing over the weekend.
3Com closed on Monday at 32-13/16, down 19/64 on the day. U.S. Robotics shares, which have traded in tandem with the ups and downs of 3Com stock, closed at 55-3/8, down 7/16.
Terms of the merger call for 3Com to exchange 1.75 shares of its stock for each Robotics share. The exchange ratio is fixed with no collar, according to officials of the two companies.
The value of the 3Com offer to Robotics shareholders -- which stood at $68 when the deal was announced -- has fallen in line with the six-point decline in 3Com shares. At Monday's close, the offer was worth $57-27/64 in Robotics shares.
Analysts said shareholder disatisfaction with the proposal extends into mid-level management at Robotics. Options given employees in recent years are worthless at current price levels.  
One investment banker not involved in the deal said he made inquiries after the announcement seeking alternative bidders. ""What we found is that there was not a high level of interest among competitors to enter a rival bid to 3Com,"" he said.
In the near-term, 3Com's rivals appear content to let the deal stand, seeing the distraction of managing the integration of 3Com, a leading corporate network supplier, with Robotics, the top consumer modem maker, as a competitive advantage.
Competitors ""preferred to see 3Com and Robotics go through this period of pain instead of doing anything to break the deal up,"" the banker said. ""They feel this deal is going to slow 3Com in the near-term.""
But analysts said the deal was vulnerable because it involved a stock swap only, leaving it open to someone willing to pay cash or a stronger stock price. A shareholder vote is not expected for several months, giving rivals time to mull options.
""It's very possible that if the 3Com price continues to fall, USRX continues to fall too,"" Senan said. ""If I were a USRX shareholder, I would be willing to consider other bids.""
A U.S. Robotics spokeswoman, asked if the company had been approached by other potential bidders, said: ""As a matter of policy, we don't comment on rumors or speculation.""  
One possible new suitor mentioned on Monday was network industry leader Cisco Systems Inc.
Volpe, Welty and Co analyst Amar Senan said Cisco ""could certainly afford to buy U.S. Robotics with minimal dilution. It's speculation, but it is also possible. It all depends on how much of a threat Cisco sees in this merger.""
Cisco fell 1-3/8 to 54-1/4 on Monday, topping the Nasdaq most active list with 12.5 million shares traded. Cisco officials were not immediately available for comment.

EricAuchard,"Sony Corp. will unveil Monday an Internet-based staging area for consumers to sample, play and even purchase the entertainment giant's vast store of popular television, film, music and video games.
""The Station at Sony.com,"" as Sony's site is to be known, represents a major push by the consumer electronics and entertainment giant to make its presence felt on the Web.
The Station moves Sony beyond the typical company-promotion site to offer many features of a full-scale online network comparable to that of America Online Inc.
Sony officials said they believed the Station could make Sony the top entertainment brand on the Web -- ""the place people turn to play,"" to quote a Sony official -- just as Disney has come to symbolise children's programming and ESPN means sports.
""For the first time, Sony has brought together the best of all it has to offer, "" Mitchell Cannold, president of Sony Online, the U.S.-based Internet marketing unit of Sony, said of the centralized entertainment site.
""Our goal is to make The Station the primary online entertainment destination for fun and games -- a place that Web users of every age will be able to be entertained in, have fun and make their own,"" Cannold said.
The Sony Station harnesses the latest Web technology to allow users to sample and buy music and film clips, or communicate with other Station visitors in an array of topical discussion areas, called ""chat rooms,"" on the site.
One feature is a special ""back-stage pass"" that appears on computer screens of those who sign up to join the Sony site.
Called the ""StationPass,"" this token functions as a kind of electronic mail connection that travels with users to outside Web sites, keeping them in touch with other StationPass holders.
The StationPass uses new Java programming technology that will allow the computer user to remain in touch with other StationPass holders by pager or other digital communications device.
Sony said it has laid down strict formating guidelines for graphics, text and other content on the Station, so computer users with PCs purchased in recent years using a standard modem should suffer few delays when visiting the site.
Games and contests of all sorts are available, from Sony Wonder interactive entertainment for children, to online versions of the TV game shows Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, to Battleground, a new type of multiplayer game where a thousand combatants can navigate tanks through a futuristic warzone.
Station visitors can shop for Sony merchandise and collectible items, along with Columbia TriStar home videos and Sony Wonder kids products like CDs, boosk and tape packages.
Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications and a veteran industry analyst, predicted that popular entertainment fans will find the Sony Station engrossing.
If people go to the Web to be entertained -- to play a game like Jeopardy, to see a soap opera like ""Days of Our Lives,"" or to sample the new single by Mariah Carey, they will go to Sony Station and they will go there regularly,"" he said.
Promising to provide a boost to the site is an exclusive joint marketing partnership Sony has agreed to with Visa U.S.A., the credit card consortium.
In return for making Visa the preferred method of payment for goods purchased at the site, Visa has agreed to feature the Sony brand name in a major TV and publishing campaign Visa plans to launch later this year to promote Internet commerce.
A Visa marketing executive confirmed outlines of the deal.
The agreement makes Sony the exclusive ""entertainment"" brand to be featured in the ads, although other brands may also appear, Sony officials said.
They said Visa's outside marketing commitment represents ""many millions of dollars"" in free advertising for the site.
More immediately, Sony said it planned a broad promotional campaign in publications such as Wired magazine and other advertising venues to promote the lauch of the Station.
Sony also boasts of having the largest amount of brand name advertising ever assembled for a new site, with marquis names like Sears, Roebuck and Co., General Motors Corp., American Airlines, Kellogg Co., Colgate Palmolive and Microsoft Corp.
Sony said it expected the six companies to contribute roughly $1 million for it to display ads during 1997, a figure that excludes any unpaid reciprocal promotions.
Ads targeted to fit computer users' personal interests pop-up as they click to navigate through the Web pages of the Station. The target audience is young people, the same 18-to-34-year-old demographic group that is already active on the Web.
While a complete range of Sony brand products will be available, the Station also has been opened up to allow selected corporate partners also to showcase their products. Half the products on the site are from Sony, officials said.

EricAuchard,"New York state utility regulators Thursday approved the $23 billion Nynex Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp. merger, subject to conditions the regional telephone giants must agree to by the end of March.
Consumer groups opposed to the merger that have demanded rate rebates for New York customers blasted the state Public Service Commission's decision as a sellout.
New York became the last state in Nynex's six-state service region to approve the merger, which still faces hurdles in Washington and New York.
The merger of the Baby Bells would create the nation's largest local phone company serving customers in 12 Northeastern states and Washington.
""The bedrock requirements of our approval are improved service quality and ensuring that ratepayers see tangible benefits,"" New York State Public Service Commission Chairman John O'Mara said.
He said in an interview that, while there would be no immediate rate reduction, ""We have attached conditions that we believe will bring rate reduction.""
The merger is being held up by federal regulators who are reviewing its competitive implications.
Bell Atlantic spokesman Eric Rabe said the companies now expected the deal to close after April 22, the previous target date. ""Obviously, things are moving slower than we had hoped,"" Rabe said.
He said the Justice Department had still not indicated when it would act on the deal. He said the Federal Communications Commission said it would take 30 days after the Justice Department finishes its review before it took action.
The companies welcomed the commission's decision but said in a joint statement they were still assessing the conditions.
In addition, state Attorney General Dennis Vacco expressed concern the decision did not go far enough to protect ratepayers and said he was reviewing the deal.
After several months of hearings, the three-member panel voted for the merger and the conditions in a 15-minute meeting in Albany, the state capital.
The commission said the combined company must not move major operations that were located in New York state before the merger and that its headquarters be in New York, which New York-based Nynex and Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic have agreed to.
The regulators focused on improving customer service in New York, where consumer groups have berated Nynex for offering what they call the worst service in the nation.
The approval calls on Nynex to accelerate spending to improve customer service, including hiring up to 1,000 new support staff by the end of 1997 in New York state.
A Nynex spokesman said the company has been hiring service personnel over the past year and would hire more in 1997. Last year, it hired 3,600 employees in service-related areas, three-fourths of them in New York state. Overall, Nynex has just over 68,000 employees.
Consumer groups were swift to criticise the commission's decision.
""We are outraged that this commission approved a merger that is completely anticompetitive,"" said Robert Ceisler of the New York Citizens Utility Board ratepayers' group. ""The commission has sanctioned a more powerful and richer monopoly.""
Consumer advocates had demanded the commission at least force Nynex to give consumers immediate rebates to compensate for the reduced competition and greater efficiencies expected from the merger.
Other conditions cited were having Bell Atlantic pledge to observe existing agreements between regulators and Nynex, that Nynex employee pension funds be protected, and that Bell Atlantic grant regulators access to its records.
Nynex stock closed down 37.5 cents at $47 while Bell Atlantic fell 75 cents to $63.625, both in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"
EricAuchard,"New York State utility regulators are set to approve the Bell Atlantic Corp/NYNEX Corp merger, subject to several conditions, to be set forth prior to a final vote set for Thursday.
Regulators will consider demanding the combined company permanently locate its headquarters in New York, reduce rates, issue $300 million in rebates and improve customer service.
These conditions were among those considered at a hearing Wednesday of the N.Y. Public Service Commission in Albany, the state capitol, which will be taken up at tommorrow's meeting.
The merger would create the nation's largest local phone operator and still faces hurdles in Washington, as well as New York, the only state now withholding its approval.
In Washington, the combination reportedly has met with increased scrutiny in recent weeks from anti-trust officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Federal officials have issued new subpeonas requesting details on rivals' plans to offer local phone service in New York.
The deal still faces an ongoing anti-trust review by New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who argues the merger strengthens NYNEX's existing monopoly and represents a bad deal for N.Y. residential and small business customers.
""We are watching closely the review being conducted by the PSC,"" said Joe Mahoney, a spokeman in the office of the Attorney General, the state's top anti-trust regulator.
Vacco may issue a statement on the subject if the PSC makes its decision Thursday, the spokesman said.
Regulators seek to balance the economic benefits and efficencies created by the merger with any negatives that may arise by strengthening NYNEX's grip on local service and the potential that has to slow the entry of new competitors.
A report by the staff of the N.Y. Public Service Commission discussed at Wednesday's hearing before the three-member panel argued that NYNEX and its merger partner should be required to immediately refund roughly $300 million.
The figure represents one third of the $908 million the report estimated would be the economic benefit of the deal.
The companies dispute this figure, arguing the potential benefit is likely to reach only $600 million by the third year of the deal, according to Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith.
Consumer advocates, who oppose the merger, have countered that the companies should rebate $1.25 billion immediately to consumers, a figure that includes an estimated cost of the loss of competition resulting from the merger. That represents 15 percent of the gains the combined Bell Atlantic could expect to enjoy in the coming five years, they maintain.
However, two of the three commissioners called for any decision about a customer rebate be postponed until a more complete picture of the impact of the deal emerges.
Commission members asked whether the impact should be based on current estimates or whether the determination should wait to see what happens to pricing after the entry of new competitive forces and any savings achieved by the merger.
They also called for other tangible economic benefits to the state, such as strong assurances that the company's primary headquarters will be located in New York.
Commissioner Thomas Duleavy called for the New York corporate headquarters of the company ""not to be one of form, but one of substance.""
Commissioners also said they want to see more tangible benefits for wholesale and retail NYNEX customers.
They also may decide to increase an existing plan designed to spur NYNEX to improve its long-criticized customer support operations. One proposal would demand that NYNEX increase hiring of customer support personnel and rapidly bring service quality up to the standards of Bell Atlantic.
Also Thursday, the commission approved a two-zone pricing plan that would allow NYNEX competitors to selectively choose which services they purchase from the local phone company as they offer local phone services of their own.
A press advisory issued after Wednesday's meeting said the NYPSC had ""reserved a final decision on the NYNEX - Bell Atlantic merger until a special Commission session scheduled for Thursday.""
The meeting is set to for 1000 EST/1500 GMT in Albany.
Bell Atlantic closed Wednesday down 1-7/8 to 63-3/8. NYNEX fell 1-3/4 at 47-3/8. The declines reflected a broad decline among Baby Bell stocks and the stock market in general.

EricAuchard,"America Online Inc. said on Tuesday it plans to launch a national Internet service in Japan in mid-April, and vowed to make Japan its biggest international market within a couple of years.
""Japan is a huge market opportunity for AOL, and we are pursuing it aggressively,"" AOL Chairman Steve Case said in a statement. ""Over the next few years, we plan to make Japan our largest international market.""
AOL Japan Inc. is a three-way joint venture by America Online, Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd., a diversified Japanese trading company; and publisher Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc., or Nikkei. America Online owns a 50 percent stake, Mitsui 40 percent and Nikkei 10 percent.
Taking aim at established rivals in Japan, officials with Dulles, Va.-based America Online, the world's No. 1 online service, said the new service would offer a range of graphically oriented, multimedia features not available on the largely text-based services of other Japanese online services.
Leading online and Internet service providers include Nifty-serve, a 2 million-member Japanese licensee of Columbus, Ohio-based CompuServe Corp. ; PCVAN, a unit of Fujitsu Ltd. and ASCIINet, a unit of ASCII Corp..
AOL Japan promised to make its service uniquely Japanese, with content, customer service, billing and management all rendered in the Japanese language.
AOL Japan will be offered at a monthly fee of 980 Japanese yen, or about $8, for three hours' use, and 480 yen, or $4, for each additional hour, about half the hourly price of Nifty-serve, Japan's dominant online service.
New AOL Japan members will get a 10-hour free trial in the first month, the company said.
AOL International President Jack Davies said the service will offer a fixed price for access to all information services, in contrast to Nifty-Serve requirements for access to some databases.
Another newcomer to Japan's market for online and Internet access is Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Network (MSN), which is allied with national phone company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp..
MSN Network claims more than 200,000 members in Japan.
Industry analyst Peter Krasilovsky said AOL Japan and MSN were positioned to rapidly acquire market share from incumbent online service providers like Nifty-Serve, whose services have an antiquated look compared to AOL.
""It looks like AOL will be a major player, battling it out with the Microsoft Network,"" said Krasilovsky of Arlen Communications, a consulting group based in Bethesda, Md.
Japan's total online audience is estimated at around 5.7 million computer users, America Online said, citing recent statistics from market research firm International Data Corp.
AOL Japan will have access to news from Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper and other well-known Japanese publications.
The service will supply sports, news and entertainment to Japanese subscribers and give them direct access to other America Online services around the world, plus member-to-member chat groups, electronic mail and Internet access.
Additional partnerships will be announced with major Japanese publishers before the service is launched April 15, America Online officials said.
Initially, about two-thirds of Japan's population will be able to dial the service via local numbers, officials said. The company plans to make more comprehensive access available shortly. Like its North American and European cousins, AOL Japan will target home computer users, not businesses.
America Online is the world's largest online service with 8 million subscribers. CompuServe is second at 5.3 million members, including the 2 million Nifty-Serve members.
America Online also said Tuesday its international subscriber count had surpassed the 600,000 mark and was on track to reach 1 million members by September.
America Online has nearly 500,000 members in Europe, and AOL Canada has more than 100,000 members, the company said.
""Our goal is to have 1 million members outside of the U.S. by September 1997. We think we are well on track to acheive that with the growth in Japan and other countries,"" Davies said in a phone interview.

EricAuchard,"Cisco Systems Inc. is set to announce the acquisition of Telesend Inc., a developer of low-cost, high-speed Internet access technology, sources familiar with the deal said Tuesday.
Cisco agreed to acquire Telesend, a privately-held Cupertino, Calif.-based firm, in exchange for an unspecified amount of stock in Cisco, the sources said.
Additional financial terms were not available.
Telesend is the developer of a new telecommunications technology known as ISDN DSL, or IDSL for short. The full name is Integrated Services Digital Network Digital Subscriber Line.
A Cisco spokesman had no comment on the acquisition other than to say, ""Most of our acquisitions are of small, privately-held firms.""
The spokesman, Adam Stein, said Cisco has made 14 mainly technology-oriented acquisitions in the last three-and-a-half years.
Officials of Telesend were not available to comment, but an automated voicemail system answering calls at Telesend's offices in Cupertino transferred callers directly to a Cisco switchboard operator. Cisco is headquartered in nearby San Jose.
Telesend's IDSL is a local-loop modem technology that allows phone companies to offer Internet access connections from central office switches to local customers at speeds of up to 128,000 bits per second, or about four times the speed of standard phone lines.
Kieran Taylor, an analyst at market research firm TeleChoice Inc., said buying Telesend is a strategic move by Cisco to counter IDSL products announced a month and a half ago by rival equipment maker Ascend Communications Inc.

EricAuchard,"Shareholders of MCI Communications Corp are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favor of the proposed merger with British Telecommunications Plc at MCI's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday.
The shareholder vote is one of the first major milestones on the road to winning approval for the $23 billion cross-border merger, which will create a combined company known as Concert Plc with $40.6 billion in revenues.  
The merger awaits regulatory approvals in Washington, London and Brussels, the headquarters of the European Commission. Company officials are confident the merger -- announced in November 1996 -- is on track to close in the fall of 1997.
The annual meeting, to be held in out-of-the-way Wilkes Barre, Pa., two hours north of Philadelphia, is expected to be a quiet affair, with only three items on the agenda: the shareholder vote, and election of directors and auditors.
Wilkes Barre was chosen because it was the hometown of William McGowan, the legendary founder and former chairman of MCI, who died in June 1992.  
In his speech to shareholders Wednesday, Bert Roberts, MCI's current chairman and chief executive, is expected to focus on the projected benefits of its merger, which would create one of the world's first global communications carriers.
One industry analyst briefed by the company said he expected Roberts to reveal some of the early products and services that may result from its ties to British Telecom.
Among the possible offerings would be seamless services connecting the United States and Britain, including wireless phone transmission, faxing, electronic mail, voice mail and the Internet, the analyst said.  
Industry analysts believe the MCI official will also respond to AT&amp;T Corp's initiative to offer local phone service using a fixed wireless system attached to the side of a customer's premises as a means of bypassing local networks controlled by regional Bell companies.
Through interconnection pacts and the new wireless technology, AT&amp;T has said by 1998 it plans to offer local service to the vast majority of the U.S. population.  
MCI made an early move into local phone markets with its MCI Metro unit but has appeared less aggressive than its rivals since the passage of the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 in evolving a strategy to expand its local phone presence.
A key benefit of the merger with cash-rich British Telecom is the financing muscle that MCI can tap as it seeks to slice substantial market share away from the incumbent regional Bell companies in various local service markets.  
MCI provides local service in 20 U.S. metropolitan markets through a mix of company-owned facilities and resale agreements to use other companies' networks. It has said it plans to be in 31 local service markets by the end of 1997.
By contrast, long-distance rivals AT&amp;T and Sprint Corp have each said they are gearing up to compete in the 50 top U.S. metropolitan markets by year-end.
There are three nominees, all British, to the MCI board. They include Sir Peter Bonfield, British Telecom's chief executive and a current MCI board member; Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry and chairman of British Airways ; and J. Keith Oates, deputy chairman of British retail group Marks and Spencer Plc.
Sources close to the company said they expected a favorable vote at the meeting, due in part to the substantial 20 percent stake that British Telecom already owns of MCI and the lack of opposition to the merger among other shareholders.
The MCI vote will be followed April 15 by an extraordinary general meeting of British Telecom shareholders to be held at Wembley Stadium in London.

EricAuchard,"Lucent Technologies Inc expects its lagging consumer products unit -- the smallest of four product divsions -- to show substantial profit gains in 1997 and a return to revenue growth by the December quarter.
""We expect a substantial improvement in profitablity this year (for the unit) mainly through cost-cutting,"" Chief Financial Officer Don Peterson Peterson ""and positive revenue growth"" in the December quarter, due to new products.  Earlier Thursday, Lucent had said consumer product revenues fell 41 percent in the second quarter ended in March.  
Consumer products comprised a small fraction of total March quarter revenues of $5.15 billion.  It was the only Lucent unit not to see double-digit growth in the quarter.
The division's revenues fell to $174 million in the March quarter due to the impact on sales resulting from the closing in 1996 of hundreds of phone center stores, the streamlining of the product line and reduced revenue from phone rentals.
Revenues from Lucent's carrier network systems division jumped 23.3 percent to $2.93 billion, while the business communications unit rose 14.1 percent to $1.3 billion and semiconductor revenues gained 18.3 percent to $615 million.  
In addition, Peterson told Reuters the company's closely watched backlog of customer equipment orders remained ""in the $4 billion range, or about the same level it was in the fiscal first quarter ended in December 1996.""
""The backlog was about the same level that we talked about in the prior quarter's conference call,"" Peterson said.
He said the backlog was replenished by about $600 million in new wireless equipment orders in Taiwan, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines and Mexico balancing out the revenue recognized from prior equipment contracts during the quarter.  
The Lucent executive said he expected the company to maintain its gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues at around 42 to 43 percent for the fiscal 1997 year ending in September.
For the March quarter, Lucent reported an overall gross margin of 42.1 percent, down from the 45.9 percent reported in the seasonally strong volume December 1996 quarter but up from the 39.9 percent margin in the year-ago March quarter.
""I don't see margin expansion as a major opportunity, but I do think we can hold onto it if we run the business right,"" he said of plans to hold margins at 43 percent in fiscal 1997.  
Peterson said international revenues increased 26 percent over the year-ago quarter to $1.26 billion from $1.0 billion.
Because most large equipment contracts are transacted in U.S. dollars, he said the impact of currency translation on Lucent results was immaterial during the latest quarter and was expected to have minimal impact for the rest of the year.
Speaking of plans to pump up consumer product revenues, he said the company plans to introduce a slew of new products including wireless, cordless and corded phones and answering machines to replace older models.  
After a round of profit-taking in the morning that sent Lucent shares down 5/8 of a point, the stock recovered in mid-afternoon trading to 54-7/8, up 1/4 of a point on the day.

EricAuchard,"Bell Atlantic Corp. said Thursday its earnings rose sharply in the first quarter, boosted by growth in its telephone and cellular businesses.
The Philadelphia-based telecommunications company reported first-quarter net income of $515.6 million, an increase of 11.0 percent over the $464.7 million it earned in first quarter of 1996. Earnings per share rose to $1.17 from $1.06, slightly more than the First Call consensus estimate of $1.16.
Operating revenues grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion.
""This was a good solid set of numbers,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Simon Flannery said of the strong showing in new and second-line growth, wireless business and productivity.
""In spite of investments for new initiatives, they were still able to deliver double-digit earnings growth in the latest quarter,"" he said.
Bell Atlantic Chairman and Chief Executive Raymond Smith said, ""Demand for our services, including data connectivity, wireless and value-added services, continues to drive excellent bottom line performance.""
Anticipating a landmark year for the company, Smith said, ""We are heading toward the closing of our merger with Nynex with great momentum. With solid fundamentals, we are poised for a terrific year in 1997.""
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Bell Atlantic and Nynex Corp. are stepping preparations for a legal counter-attack if the Justice Department blocks their proposed $23 billion merger, which was announced in April 1996.
Smith said the company has been able to absorb significant start-up costs for new ventures, such as the PrimeCo personal communications services partnership and international wireless activities.
The chief factors in the latest results were continued cost-control measures and the strong performance of Bell Atlantic's core business units, driven by revenue growth of 7.6 percent, including Bell Atlantic's proportionate share of domestic cellular revenues.
The year-ago results excluded a non-cash $142.1 million charge the comnpany took to cover a change in the method for booking revenues from its directory publishing business in 1996. After the restatement, first-quarter 1996 net income was $606.8 million, but investors focused on the company's actual operating results.
Bell Atlantic's stock gained $1 to $60.25 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The latest earnings report consolidates the results of the Mexican Grupo Iusacell SA de CV investment for the first time following Bell Atlantic's assumption of operational control of the business in February. Specific figures were not broken out in the company's statement.
"
EricAuchard,"Lucent Technologies Inc. said Thursday it earned $66 million the first three months of 1997, reversing a big loss as it ended its first year as an independent company.
Lucent, the former high-technology manufacturing unit of AT&amp;T Corp., reported net income of $66 million, or 10 cents a share, for the three months ended March 31, reversing a loss of $103 million, or 16 cents a share, in the 1996 quarter.
The company, which designs and builds public and private communications systems and networks and telecommunications equipment, said revenues for its fiscal second quarter grew by 12.5 percent to $5.15 billion from $4.58 billion.
Lucent said it benefited from strengthened relationships with the regional Bell companies that followed its spin-off from AT&amp;T a year ago.
Previously, local phone companies had been reluctant to do business with the AT&amp;T equipment unit, seeing AT&amp;T as a potential rival in the coming era of open competition for local and long-distance services.
Of Lucent's four main businesses, only consumer products suffered a decline in revenues for the quarter, which was expected, the company said.
""We're delighted to report double-digit revenue growth and a dramatic quarter-over-quarter rise in profits as we complete our first year as a public company,"" Chairman Henry Schacht said in a statement.
""Our strong U.S. and international sales to network operators, businesses and microelectronics customers position us well to take maximum advantage of the exploding communications technology market.""
The company, based in Murray Hill, N.J., said its gross profit margin for the quarter rose to 42.1 percent of revenues from 39.9 percent, due primarily to higher sales volume and productivity improvements.
Lucent said its revenues from systems for network operators increased 23.3 percent to $2.93 billion. Revenues for microelectronic products increased 18.3 percent to $615 million and revenues for business communications systems increased 14.1 percent to $1.308 billion.
Revenues from consumer products decreased 41 percent to $174 million as a result of continuing reengineering of the business to increase profitability, Lucent said.
The company said the decrease was expected following the closing of its phone centre stores, the streamlining of its product line and expected reductions in phone rentals.
Lucent said continuing demand for second telephone lines in businesses and residences for uses such as Internet access, data traffic and fax services contributed to solid gains in sales of wireless systems, switching systems and related software.
Chief Financial Officer Don Peterson said the company expects its lagging consumer products unit -- the smallest of four product divsions -- to show substantial profit gains in 1997 and a return to revenue growth by the December quarter.
""We expect a substantial improvement in profitablity this year (for the unit) mainly through cost-cutting, and positive revenue growth"" due to new products, he said.
Lucent's stock closed at $54.125, down 50 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.

EricAuchard,"On top of its domestic troubles, AT&amp;T Corp must now contend with new threats to its international strategy after Friday's defection of Spain's Telefonica into the rival British Telecom-MCI camp.
""They certainly have a lot of balls up in the air,"" Bear Stearns telecommunications analyst Bill Deatherage said, referring to the multiple battles facing AT&amp;T, the largest U.S. telephone company.  
The international rebuff comes just ahead of AT&amp;T's first-quarter earnings report, slated for release Monday.
Wall Street expectations are set low after the company's warning to financial analysts in early March that heavy investments in competitive initiatives would cause earnings in 1997 to fall substantially short of profit last year.
Analysts on average expect AT&amp;T to post first-quarter earnings of $0.69 per share, down from $0.90 in the 1996 first quarter.  
Analysts agree AT&amp;T's primary focus must remain on shoring up its domestic results, most of all in its core long-distance business, which is contending with market share losses to large long-distance rivals as well as smaller niche players. At the same time, it must gear up for the emerging competition in local phone and wireless communications services, they said.
Nonetheless, global alliances are forming fast, and AT&amp;T is widely perceived to have been put on the defensive after recent moves by Concert, the British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp alliance.  
On Friday, Telefonica de Espana SA said it struck an alliance with MCI and British Telecom, a move that is expected to open up the vast Latin American market for Concert.
Later, AT&amp;T said Telefonica's new relationship was ""incompatible"" with the Spanish company's membership in the Unisource telecom alliance backed by AT&amp;T.
The U.S.-based company said it expected to spend $8 billion to $9 billion this year -- mainly on new high-speed data networks and to expand wireless services -- which would dilute earnings by $0.75 to $1.00 per share.
"
EricAuchard,"AT&amp;T Corp. said Monday its first-quarter profits fell 17 percent, trimmed by competition in long-distance services and investments in new businesses, and warned second quarter results might be weak as well.
Meanwhile, BellSouth Corp., a strong performer among regional telephone companies, said its operating earnings rose 11 percent due to a rise in the number of customer lines and strong growth in its wireless operations.
AT&amp;T said it earned $1.13 billion, or 69 cents a share, on revenues of $13.05 billion, down from net income of $1.36 billion, or 85 cents a share, on revenues of $12.85 billion in the first quarter of 1996.
AT&amp;T's earnings per share for the first quarter were in line with Wall Street's expectations based on previous guidance the company had provided financial analysts.
""Results are where we expected them to be as we implement our strategy,"" Chairman Robert Allen said in a statement.
In a conference call Monday, AT&amp;T also warned that its second quarter results were likely to be weaker than the first quarter but that its expectations for the full year remained on track.
Most Wall Street analysts said they planned to reduce their earnings estimates for the remainder of the year.
""There was not a great deal to cheer in the results,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman said.
AT&amp;T's first quarter revenue increase was driven by growth in local telephone service and other initiatives, business long-distance services and wireless services. That was partially offset by declines in financial services and consumer long-distance revenues, the company said.
AT&amp;T said long-distance calling volume in the most recent quarter increased by 6.7 percent over the same period of 1996, but revenue from those services rose only 0.6 percent to $11.51 billion.
Volume from consumer long-distance was flat and revenue fell 1 percent to $6.06 billion, the company said. Revenue from business long-distance rose 2.4 percent on a double-digit increase in volume.
""AT&amp;T's results portend a tougher environment for other long distance companies of all sizes,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Reingold, adding that prices in the industry were falling more steeply than he expected.
What is bad news for AT&amp;T and its rivals, however, is good news for consumers who are already seeing the benefit of sharply lower international calling rates, analysts said.
Atlanta-based BellSouth said it earned $693 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenues of $4.8 billion in the three months ended March 31, slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations.
A year earlier the company earned $626 million, or 63 cents a share, before a one-time gain of $344 million, or 35 cents a share, on the sale of paging operations.
Revenues were $4.5 billion in the 1996 quarter.
""BellSouth's 17th consecutive quarter of improved operating results was driven by our innovative marketing,"" said Chief Executive Officer Duane Ackerman, adding that, ""Sales increased across the board.""
The company said the number of customer lines increased by 379,000 -- the biggest gain for any quarter in its history, breaking the old mark of 359,000 set in the first quarter of 1996. BellSouth now has a total of 22.5 milllion access lines.
BellSouth said the company's U.S. cellular operations ended the first quarter with 3.8 million customers, reflecting an annual growth rate of 24 percent. In international cellular markets, customers rose 76 percent since the first quarter of 1996, reaching 1.5 million.
""These are just blistering numbers,"" Montgomery Securities analyst Bill Vogel said of BellSouth's growth in customer access lines and the value-added services like Caller ID and Call Waiting the company offers in addition to basic access.
""They not only have the access lines growing, but the services on those lines growing sharply,"" he said.
Vogel, who maintains a ""buy"" rating on the stock, said he expected BellSouth earnings to accelerate beyond the 11 percent rise seen in the first quarter as the company benefits from rising growth in new services.
BellSouth stock closed down 50 cents at $40.50 and AT&amp;T closed off 62.5 cents at $33, on the New York Stock Exchange.

"
EricAuchard,"MCI Communications Corp. Thursday reported flat quarterly earnings despite a healthy rise in revenues, and the company warned that growth might slow as it embraces higher profit margin businesses.
The telecommunications company earned $295 million, or 42 cents a share, in the first quarter, unchanged from a year ago and in line with analysts' consensus estimates. Revenues grew 8.7 percent to $4.9 billion from $4.1 billion.
""MCI continues to demonstrate strong overall revenue growth and profits,"" said Gerald Taylor, chief executive. ""As we move towards our merger with BT, MCI is focused on implementing long term strategies that position us for growth.""
In October, MCI and British Telecom announced a merger valued at $23 billion that would create the world's second-largest telecommunications group. The deal is expected to close in the fall, subject to regulatory approval.
Long-distance revenues rose 8.2 percent to $4.4 billion from $4.1 billion, twice the pace of MCI's key long distance rivals, it said. Operating income was $653 million, a rise of $39 million, or 6.4 percent from last year's first quarter.
Traffic grew 4 percent from the 1996 first quarter.
MCI said, however, that it expected revenue and traffic growth rates to slow in coming quarters as the industry's growth in home phone markets moderates and as MCI invests more money in higher profit margin businesses.
Washington-based MCI said it was shifting away from selling access to its network at wholesale prices to other telephone companies, and tightening credit collection among the companies to which it sells network access.
In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine said MCI's strategy of replacing discount-seeking residential callers with customers willing to pay for value-added services should insulate it from the industry-wide slowdown.
MCI's strategy echoes concerns by rival AT&amp;T Corp., which described in its own first-quarter report Monday competitive pressures and a variety of costly ways to keep customers.
Until remaining barriers to entering the local services market drop, Maine said MCI will avoid chasing low-end consumers with AT&amp;T's practice of writing them checks.
Bear Stearns analyst Bette Massick said MCI appeared to be making progress in reducing the number of customers who switch to whichever provider offers the cheapest calling plan.
In both the business and mass markets, MCI said it is benefiting from efforts to offer integrated voice and data services on one bill under its networkMCI One and MCI One brands.
MCI's Business Markets posted double-digit revenue growth, led by especially strong growth in value-added services such as data, Internet, conferencing and pre-paid calling cards.
Business services account for about two-thirds of the company's overall revenues.
MCI's Information Technology revenues grew 27 percent to $433 million, with U.S. revenue doubling year-over-year. MCI said revenue from its Internet services has grown nearly 200 percent over first quarter 1996.
Local services revenue grew to $65 million or 63 percent year-over-year and jumped 33 percent from fourth quarter 1996, it said. MCI's stock fell $1.375 to $37.375 on Nasdaq.

EricAuchard,"U S West Communications Group. reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Friday, citing successful marketing programmes and tighter cost controls.
The Englewood, Colo.-based telephone operator earned $328 million, or 68 cents per share, in the first quarer, up from $289 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier.
The earnings were several cents ahead of Wall Street expectations, which, according to First Call Inc., put earnings at 65 cents a share.
""U S West Communications Group has started off 1997 with double-digit momentum on the heels of 1996's accelerating results,"" said Richard McCormick, chairman of U S West Inc., the holding group for the phone company.
U S West Communications serves more than 25 million customers in 14 Western and Midwestern states.
U S West officials cautioned analysts against raising their earnings projections for the year, saying investments in new wireless networks and growing competition were likely to dampen earnings growth.
The current consensus estimate for the 1997 year has U S West Communications earning $2.54 per share vs. $2.44 per share in 1996, according to First Call.
""Absent a significant regulatory shift, we remain comfortable with the consensus estimate for the 1997 year,"" Chief Financial Officer Allan Spies told Wall Street analysts.
Spies stood by a prediction U S West made at a February analysts' meeting, projecting overall earnings growth of 4 percent to 6 percent in 1997. First-quarter 1997 earnings per share grew 11.5 percent.
Revenues rose 5 percent to $2.59 billion from $2.46 billion.
The company said local service revenues grew 7.5 percent to $1.23 billion in the quarter, with almost half the growth driven by sales of value-added features beyond basic access.
It said Caller ID subscribers rose by an unprecendented 900,000 in the first quarter due to an aggressive promotional campaign. The product is now used by 26 percent of its residential customers.
Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman said the company also benefited from labour cost cuts. U S West Communications trimmed 4,000 employees in the last four quarters. It now has a work force of just over 47,000.
U S West Communications, among other Baby Bell stocks, rose amid speculation of other combinations after U.S. regulators approved the merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp.
It closed up $1.875 at $33.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

EricAuchard,"AT&amp;T Corp. said Thursday it withdrew its application with the U.S. government for a license to launch a new generation of communications satellites.
AT&amp;T's decision to cancel its application to the Federal Communications Commission follows the disposal of several of its existing satellite businesses in recent months, completing its exit from the satellite operations business.
In a statement, the New York-based company said investment in the new Ka-band satellite technology was a drain on capital resources that did not fit with a renewed focus on its core long-distance business and key growth areas like wireless, online and local services.
Ka-band refers to radio frequencies that handle two-way voice and data communications. The Ka-band satellites would hover in place in a geostationary orbit instead of circling the Earth.
The new class of satellites would have allowed AT&amp;T to offer a range of next-generation communications services such as video, data transmission and high-speed Internet services.
""We are focusing on our core business and some growth areas, and satellites is not core to that,"" AT&amp;T spokesman Gary Morgenstern said, adding that the company was not withdrawing from the satellite business completely.
AT&amp;T continues to offer satellite-based services through its minority investment in the Direct TV direct broadcast satellite venture of Hughes Electronics Corp.
AT&amp;T's Ka-band project was formally known to the industry as the AT&amp;T VoiceSpan Satellite System.
The company said about 50 employees are engaged in the VoiceSpan project and that it would attempt to reassign them.
In April, General Electric Co.'s GE Spacenet unit agreed to buy AT&amp;T's Very Small Aperture Terminal satellite operations for an undisclosed amount.
In March, AT&amp;T sold its Skynet Satellite Services unit to Loral Space &amp; Commmunications Ltd. for $478 milion. AT&amp;T also collected roughly $130 million on an insurance claim for one of its satellites which it lost in space in January.
The sale of the existing satellite operations means AT&amp;T no longer directly owns any communications satellites.
In addition, AT&amp;T recently agreed to dispose of its undersea communications cable unit -- another operation it had considered low on its list of priorities -- to Tyco International Ltd. in a deal worth about $850 million.
A dozen companies, including Hughes, Loral Space, and the international satellite consortium Intelsat have announced plans to compete in the Ka-band satellite market.
Satellites offering such high-speed communications services are not expected to be launched until the year 2000.
"
EricAuchard,"Nynex Corp. has until Monday to respond to charges it acted in bad faith by not signing an agreement with MCI Communications Corp. that would have allowed the nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier to enter Nynex's local market in New York state.
MCI filed a motion against Nynex on Monday asking the state Public Service Commission (PSC) to impose sanctions on Nynex for failing to sign the so-called interconnection agreement, which would enable MCI to provide local phone access in the state.
On Wednesday, state Attorney General Dennis Vacco filed papers with the commission seeking to bar Nynex from offering long-distance service because it discriminates against local-service rivals.
Vacco has been an outspoken critic of the proposed Bell Atlantic Corp. takeover of Nynex, and its New York Telephone operating unit, on anticompetitive grounds.
Nynex operates 11.1 million local service lines while competitors have less than 100,000 local service lines, according to state regulators' estimates.
Nynex spokesman Mark Marchand said the New York-based company strongly disagreed with Vacco's assessment of their draft application for long-distance service in New York.
""Fifty phone companies are licensed with the PSC to provide all forms of local phone service,"" Marchand said. ""What they do is up to them. The market is open. There is no other state in the country which has a more competitive market.""
Nynex has signed full interconnection deals with competitive access providers, including MFS Communications, a unit of WorldCom Inc.; Teleport Communications Group Inc. and WinStar Communications Inc.
The deals would allow the companies to route traffic over their own network switching equipment.
In addition, Nynex has reached resale pacts with Frontier Corp., among others, to allow companies to offer local access over Nynex's network.
Most of the new entrants into the New York local service market are focused on profitable niches in the business services market, rather than residential service.
The dispute is part of a broad change across the United States due to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, under which local and long-distance providers are seeking to meet regulatory requirements that would allow them to compete on each other's historic turf.
Washington-based MCI, which has waged an agressive campaign to enter local service markets, so far has reached five interconnection deals -- two in California, where Pacific Telesis and GTE Corp. operate, and with the respective Baby Bells in Georgia, Minnesota and Iowa.

EricAuchard,"Seeking to show its readiness to compete in high-speed networking, Bay Networks Inc on Tuesday unveiled a set of products and strategies aimed at shoring up its reputation as a technology leader and helping it recover from the stumbles of recent years.
David House, Bay's recently hired chairman and chief executive, outlined the company's new ""Adaptive Networking"" strategy for making the plumbing of Internet-based networks easier to upgrade to the higher-speed networks now emerging.  
""Everybody's goal is networks that are invisible to the user,"" House said during a Las Vegas press conference at Networld+Interop, the semiannual trade show of the Internet equipment industry.
""We want networks that behave like electricity and water,"" House said, comparing computer networks to other well-developed infrastructures.
""Adaptive Networks are the products and technologies that will transition us to the Internet-optimized networks of tomorrow,"" he said.  
His appearance came exactly six months after House joined Bay Networks from Intel Corp, where he served as a respected senior executive for more than two decades.
Highlighting the company's new product announcements was a new single, application-specific networking chip capable of carrying up to 1.5 million packets of Internet data a second --- allowing networks to carry billions of bits of data per second.
The company said the new Route Switch Processor (RSP) integrates the manageability of routers with the speed of switches -- two traditionally separate product categories.  
House said the RSP chip, now running in Bay laboratories, would be offered in new routing switch products due out in 1998.
The RSP chip is designed to solve the growing demand for high-speed Internet transmission, while reducing technical bottlenecks that cause congestion on overloaded data networks.
House said RSP would serve as the core technology in its main product lines, including local networks used in corporate offices and in products serving telephone and Internet carriers.  
He said the chip would allow Bay to cut switch product prices tenfold over time, driving the cost of advanced switching down to $500 per connection from $5,000 currently.
Sounding like the old chip revolution evangelist he is, House described what he said were the semiconductor-driven dynamics of the networking business, which is seeing benefits from both exponential jumps in the power of computer chip technology and commodity-style price cuts.

FumikoFujisaki,"One month after giant Japanese brokerage Nomura Securities Co Ltd revealed a scandal involving suspected illegal deals, new president Masashi Suzuki is struggling to regain trust in the company.
""I have resolved to make my utmost efforts to restore the trust we have lost,"" Suzuki told Reuters in an interview.
""I must put things in order, as our staff and branch managers are struggling with hard times because of rebukes from customers,"" he said.
On March 6, Nomura announced that an internal probe had found that two of its directors had been involved in apparently illegal deals which involved transferring money from a Nomura account to a corporate client's account.
Prosecutors and officials from Japan's securities watchdog raided Nomura on March 25 in a sign of a widening probe into Nomura's role in payments to the corporate client, who has been linked to a ""sokaiya"", or racketeer.
Sokaiya extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings.
Suzuki, 61, added the post of president to his position as chairman on March 14 when Hideo Sakamaki stepped down from the post to take responsibility for the scandal.
""It is true that holding the positions of both president and chairman is something unusual. I want to return the company to healthy shape and then transfer the company (management) to the next generation, although I cannot say when,"" he said.
As one step to avoid any recurrence of wrongdoing, Nomura will establish a compliance committee made up of senior executives and chaired by the president, Suzuki said.
He added that the scandal, which comes after a similar embarrassment in 1991 over improper payments of compensation for losses and revelations of deals with gangsters, indicates there was no healthy checking system to stop any wrongdoing at the management level.
Suzuki said the scandal had not only hurt Nomura's image but would also erode future earnings.
The scandal had little impact on results for the business year which ended on March 31, but would have a severe impact on results in the current financial year, he said.
""We don't know exactly how severe the impact on earnings will be because it is not known whether and how much administrative punishment will be imposed, but it will be very severe.""
Market sources said Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it has held among brokerages since February 1992.
Daiwa Securities Co Ltd had 9.6 percent of the TSE market in March.
Major Japanese asset management firms and some institutional investors, as well as the huge California Public Employees' Retirement Fund, suspended business with Nomura soon after it revealed the suspected illegal deals.
But Suzuki said he was convinced Nomura could again become the securities house of choice by taking all possible measures to restore its customers' trust.
""Only (financial) companies offering a distinctive business strategy can survive in liberalised financial markets. While expected liberalisation of stockbroking commissions will slash commission income, our strategy will be to offer value-added financial services,"" he said.
Japan aims to deregulate its financial markets by 2001 under a ""Big Bang"" to catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Heavily indebted Nippon Credit Bank Ltd said on Thursday it will tie up with New York blue chip Bankers Trust to help turn some of its loans into cash.
NCB, with a heavy load of real estate loans left over from the asset bubble of the 1980s, has been considered the most endangered large bank in Japan's faltering banking sector.
On April 1 it announced that it was retreating from the international arena. It also said that it was selling prime real estate and floating new shares to try to rebuild its capital base.
Under the alliance, Bankers Trust will help NCB ""securitise"" some of its loans, turning them into stocks or bonds that are sold to outside investors.
The tie-up with Bankers Trust will also enable NCB to maintain services to its customers after its planned withdrawal from overseas business, the two banks said.
NCB said that it would also consider a capital tie-up with Bankers Trust, which is on an expansion drive.
""We will consider limited capital participation in each other after the ongoing restructuring of NCB's capital is completed,"" the statement said.
Industry analysts said such an equity deal would be the first time a foreign bank has taken a stake in a Japanese bank.
But they said that it was very unlikely that Bankers Trust would take over NCB.
""(The tie-up) will make it easier for NCB to implement its restructuring programme, but its return on equity is too low for the U.S. bank to consider any takeover move,"" said Yoshinobu Yamada, analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan.
The market took the news well, with an increase in buying interest in NCB debentures. As one of Japan's three long-term credit banks, NCB raises the bulk of its cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits from customers.
In a blow to NCB's image, the debentures were recently downgraded to junk-bond status by Moody's Investors Service.
But Thursday's announcement won praise from regulators and the markets.
""The tie-up will contribute greatly to a smooth implementation of NCB's restructuring plan,"" the Bank of Japan said in a statement.
The deal was also cheered by the stock market, with NCB shares surging as much as 30 percent in afternoon trading. There was no trading for most of the day due to a surge of buy orders hitting the market.
When NCB announced its restructuring, President Hiroshi Kubota said the bank was very interested in getting help from a foreign partner, a rare statement for a Japanese corporate leader and seen as a sign of the difficult situation facing NCB in its attempt to get back on its feet.
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Dozens of Japanese banks may close their foreign operations in the next few years as their huge problem loans make it hard to meet new capital requirements, analysts say.
Two of Japan's top 20 banks have already announced they will shut down their overseas branches, and some analysts say many others should follow suit, delivering possible boosts to profitability.
""Japanese banks must cut unprofitable assets overseas to boost return on equity,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc.
""All that many of them are doing overseas is providing services to Japanese customers, rather than doing business with local customers in host countries. They are doing Japanese business even in overseas markets.""
He said that over the next few years, the number of Japanese banks operating abroad could fall to about a third of the current 85. There are a total of 149 banks in Japan.
Earlier this month, two of Japan's most troubled banks, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd announced restructuring plans that included pulling out of overseas operations. Hokkaido also said it would merge with regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd.
Hokkaido Bank closed its overseas offices last year, saying they were not profitable.
Financial authorities, worried that Japan's banking problems could destabilise global financial markets, do not object to Japanese banks closing overseas.
Sei Nakai, senior deputy director-general of the Finance Ministry's banking bureau, recently told Reuters the ministry had proposed the step to NCB and Hokkaido Takushoku to avoid the possibility of Japanese banks troubling foreign creditors.
He also said the ministry might tell other Japanese banks to retreat ""quietly"" from their overseas operations if they were in trouble.
Analysts say tougher capital adequacy requirements scheduled to be introduced from the end of March 1998 under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) could encourage Japanese banks to close their international operations.
James Fiorillo, a financial analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd, said some Japanese banks were expected to try to boost their capital to meet the BIS requirements. But others would likely take a second look at continuing internationally.
Under BIS capital adequacy requirements set in the late 1980s, Japanese banks operating internationally need capital equivalent to a minimum of 8.0 percent of risk-weighted assets.
In 1995, the BIS set second-stage guidelines that factor in market risk when determining capital requirements. This means Japanese banks operating abroad will have to take into account risks from activities such as foreign exchange transactions and swaps when calculating adequacy ratios from this fiscal year.
Some analysts calculate that the introduction of these second-stage guidelines could cut international capital adequacy ratios of Japanese banks by up to 0.3 percent.
Katsuhiro Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said major commercial, trust and long-term credit banks and big regional banks would not abandon overseas operations.
But smaller regional banks burdened by problem loans would do so as their low credit ratings had made it increasingly expensive for them to raise capital, he said.
Sasajima said some Japanese banks would likely seek foreign partners in order to maintain their services abroad.
Earlier this month, NCB said it would tie up with Bankers Trust New York Corp to help turn some of its loans into cash and to maintain services to overseas customers.
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Embattled Nomura Securities Co Ltd is expected to announce on Thursday the best results among more than 280 brokerages in Japan for the last business year, but prospects for the current year are gloomy.
Analysts said on Monday that Nomura's profits for the fiscal year which ended on March 31 should be far ahead of its competitors thanks to huge profits in bond trading and bond underwriting.
However, they added that business for Nomura in the 1997/98 year would be sharply undermined by a scandal, with the size of the expected profit drop depending on how hard the Finance Ministry comes down on Japan's largest brokerage after regulators complete their investigation.
Japanese prosecutors and securities watchdog are investigating Nomura for suspected illegal deals involving ""sokaiya"" racketeers, who extort money from a company by threatening to disturb shareholders' meetings.
In January, Nomura announced pre-tax, parent current profit of 103.69 billion yen ($829 million) for the first nine months of 1996/97, against 91.49 billion yen ($731 million) in actual current profit for the the full 1995/96 year.
""Nomura is expected to be the top in earnings in 1996/97 with profits of more than 100 billion yen ($800 million),"" said Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.
Other analysts said they expect Nomura to post parent current profit -- pre-tax profit which includes gains and losses made on securities investments and other non-operating activities -- of between 120 billion ($952 million) and 140 billion yen ($1.11 billion).
In the first nine months, Nomura posted 81.82 billion yen ($654 million) in stock brokering commission against 105.66 billion yen ($845 million) in 1995/96. Net gains on bond trading stood at 66.33 billion yen ($530 million) in the first nine months against 71.54 billion yen ($572 million).
But industry sources said they would not be surprised if Nomura posts a loss in the current year because many institutional and corporate investors have suspended their business with Nomura since it revealed on March 6 that two of its directors were involved in the suspected illegal deals.
Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it has held since February 1992.
If Nomura's market share falls by 10 percent, it will lose 12 billion yen ($96 million) in commissions, analysts said.
In addition, Nomura's underwriting business has also been hit by the scandal.
The business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported last week that Nomura had underwritten only 2.5 percent of the domestic straight bonds issued so far in April, compared with 14 percent for all of the previous business year.
Three other big brokerages -- Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, Nikko Securities Co Ltd  8603 T and Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd -- are also scheduled to announce their 1996/97 results later this month.
Analysts estimate Yamaichi's parent current profit at nil in 1996/97 against profits of 15.13 billion yen ($121 million) in the profit in 1995/96, and Nikko to have profit of 40 billion yen ($320 million), down from a profit of 65 billion yen ($520 million).
They expect Daiwa to post profit of 60 billion yen ($480 million), down slightly from 62.56 billion yen ($500 million).

FumikoFujisaki,"The president and 15 board members at Nomura Securities Co Ltd will resign to take responsibility for a racketeering scandal that has again sullied the name of Japan's biggest securities firm, the company announced on Tuesday.
The president, Masashi Suzuki, was appointed just a month ago after the resignation of his predecessor when the affair came to light.
The case is the latest to hit Japan's brokerage industry, where ties between companies and shadowy racketeers have long been a problem.
Prosecutors and the securities watchdog are investigating whether Nomura paid off the racketeer, known as ""sokaiya"", to avoid disruptions at its shareholders' meetings.
Junichi Ujiie, a Nomura managing director who will take over as president on May 1, told a news conference that his aim will be to establish a more open management system based on clear rules.
He said there was an atmosphere inside the company that discouraged free discussion among executives.
But one analyst said the reshuffle should help the brokerage transform that culture.
""I think the resignation of many executives will have a good impact on Nomura as it will make it easier for new management to reform its corporate culture,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice-president of Smith Barney International Inc.
It was not the first time that Nomura has been embroiled in scandal. In 1991 it was punished by regulators for improperly favouring certain clients.
In a separate case, news reports on Monday linked Yamaichi Securities Co to illegal deals, sparking threats of libel action by the firm.
Suzuki said that, while he had expected to transfer the company's management to the next generation after regaining public trust, Nomura's current situation was serious, requiring sweeping changes.
""Nomura is experiencing the worst crisis since it was founded,"" he said.
He said that Nomura was facing difficult problems, including continued investigation by regulators and expected administrative punishment by the Finance Ministry.
He also said Nomura's clients had increasingly been suspending business with the brokerage since the beginning of April and Nomura's employees were receiving complaints from customers.
Hideo Sakamaki, who resigned as Nomura's president last month when the scandal broke, said earlier on Tuesday that the company had paid more than 70 million yen ($555,000) via stock deals into accounts linked to a racketeer.
Sakamaki, who was testifying before a committee of the Upper House of parliament, said that one of the irregular stock deals included a transaction involving more than seven million shares in a commercial bank on March 15, 1993.
It was the first time a Nomura insider had publicly revealed the amount of money transferred to the racketeer.
A Japanese news service reported on Tuesday that the Ministry of Finance was likely to suspend some of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as punishment for the scandal.
An official at Nomura, who declined to be named, said that he welcomed the reshuffle.
""While I feel sympathy for the people who have to resign, Nomura employees are welcoming the decision,"" he said.
Morale at Nomura's branches has fallen since the scandal was revealed in March, but the sweeping executive reshuffle will help restore confidence in Nomura not only by investors but also by its employees, he said. ($1=126 yen)

The drastic reshuffling was a surprise, and could be what is needed to help encourage small investors to return to Japan's stock markets, he added.
Earlier on Tuesday, Nomura announced that president Masashi Suzuki will resign on May 1 and will be replaced by managing director Junichi Ujiie.
Nomura also said that 15 company board members, including five vice presidents and four senior managing directors, will resign on April 30 and become company advisers.
Suzuki, who will retain his chairmanship but lose his right to represent the company, told a news conference that the executives will not join in the decision-making process after they become advisers and are expected to leave Nomura to join companies affiliated with Nomura.

FumikoFujisaki,"Scandal-tainted Nomura Securities Co Ltd said on Thursday that it could post parent current profits for the current business year despite expected penalties that would temporarily suspend some of its business.
Analysts said, however, that the results at Japan's biggest brokerage for 1997/98 would hinge on when and how hard the Ministry of Finance (MOF) comes down on Nomura after regulators complete their investigation.
Japanese prosecutors and the country's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Council (SESC), are currently investigating Nomura's suspected illegal stock deals linked to a ""sokaiya"" racketeer.
Sokaiya extort money from companies by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings.
The SESC is expected to recommend that MOF take punitive action against Nomura, and analysts said that whether Nomura posts a profit this year will depend on when a punitive suspension of operations would occur and how long it would last.
""If the SESC completes its investigation in May and the MOF's administrative punishment ends before the end of September, then Nomura would be able to escape the worst-case scenario,"" said Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.
However, another analyst, who declined to be named, said if the punitive suspension continues into the second half of 1997/98, it might be difficult for Nomura to post a profit.
""If the investigation lasts a long time and the punishment affects Nomura's business in the latter half, it would seriously hurt earnings. It is possible for the company to post a loss,"" he said.
But he added that if the punitive action does not affect business in the second half, it would be possible for Nomura to post a parent current profit of up to 50 billion yen.  
Market sources said they expected the authorities could suspend Nomura's underwriting operations and stock dealing on its own account for up to three months as a penalty for the scandal.
On Thursday, Takamichi Arata, a Nomura director, said at a news conference: ""Even if our business is suspended, we will be able to post profits in the current business year because of a cutback in expenditures in April and thereafter.""
Analysts said, however, that speculation is growing that similar scandals may emerge at other big brokerages and this may delay investigations at Nomura.
""There is talk that the investigation will end after Japan's 'Golden Week' holiday (in the first week in May), but there is also speculation it may take a long time as regulators have started probes of similar wrongdoing at other big brokers,"" an analyst said.
Under Japan's Securities and Exchange Law, the SESC could advise the finance minister to take punitive administrative action against Nomura if it finds evidence of illegal activity. The heaviest penalty would be the revocation of securities licences and the suspension of business for up to six months.
MOF is currently awaiting the outcome of the investigation, a MOF official said, but he added that the focus is on whether Nomura violated the commercial code rather than securities law.
Japanese commercial law prohibits payoffs to racketeers. The securities law bans discretionary transactions and the transfer of a broker's trading profits to the account of a client, both actions which Nomura said two of its directors were suspected of undertaking.
James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd, said he is rather optimistic, adding that Nomura's experience with a scandal in the early 1990s proved that the firm could quickly repair the damage caused by the latest dubious deals.
""In light of this, current forecasts that Nomura will take years to win back business and restore its reputation appear exaggerated,"" he said.
In addition to its stock broking and underwriting business, Nomura is also highly influential in the yen bond market and is Japan's top seller of foreign bonds.
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Scandal-tainted Japanese brokerage Nomura Securities Co plunged into the red on a net basis last business year after incurring a hefty special loss due to a cash injection to a troubled subsidiary.
But the nation's biggest brokerage said on Thursday it enjoyed a healthy jump in its current profit in the year to March, helped by income from bond trading and underwriting.
Nomura, mired in controversy over a scandal linking it with ""sokaiya"" racketeers, said it posted a parent net loss 271.51 billion yen ($2.15 billion) in 1996/97 against a profit of 23.1 billion yen ($183 million) in 1995/96.
This largely reflects a special loss of 371 billion yen ($2.94 billion) resulting from Nomura's aid to its troubled financial affiliate Nomura Finance Co.
The brokerage meanwhile recorded a parent current profit of 124.19 billion yen ($985 million) in the year, up 35.7 percent year-on-year and the highest in six years. Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains and losses made on investments.
On a group basis, Nomura said it posted a net loss of 91.07 billion yen ($722 million) in 1996/97 after a profit of 81.27 billion yen ($645 million) the year before under U.S. accounting rules.
Japan's securities industry suffered a major setback last month when Nomura said two of its directors were involved in suspected illegal deals in which substantial sums of Nomura money were moved to the account of a corporate customer who was linked to a sokaiya.
The outlook for Nomura's business remains gloomy. It has already been hit hard by the scandal, which has led many clients to refrain from trading with it.
In March alone, Nomura's current profit dropped to about half the usual monthly levels due to the scandal, which cut its brokerage commissions and its share of the underwriting market, a company executive said on Thursday.
""As one might expect, the scandal has had an effect (on our profits),"" Nomura director Takamichi Arata told reporters. But he added it was hard to calculate the extent of the impact.
Arata said the brokerage hopes to post a parent current profit this month and in succeeding months by cutting operating costs.
Nomura was cutting its monthly operating expenditures to between 20.2 billion and 20.3 billion yen (about $161 million) per month in April, down two billion yen ($15.8 million) from March, he said. That would be 22 percent below the peak of 26 billion yen ($206 million) five years ago, Arata said.
Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo bourse fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it had held since February 1992.
Analysts said the fate of Nomura's business this financial year hinges on how hard the Ministry of Finance comes down on the brokerage after regulators complete their investigation.
Japanese media reports say the authorities could suspend some of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as a penalty for the scandal.
Such a penalty would be the heaviest ever imposed on a securities firm in Japan.
Nomura on Monday announced that its president and 15 board members will resign on May 1 to take responsibility for the scandal. ($1=126 yen)

FumikoFujisaki,"Japanese life insurers, already unhappy at having to help out ailing Nippon Credit Bank, are angry at the Finance Ministry which they say has ignored trouble at failed insurer Nissan Mutual Life for years.
""The responsibility of the Finance Ministry is heavy,"" a life insurance company official, who declined to be named, said on Friday.
""The ministry has not taken any appropriate action to inform Nissan insurance's policy holders of the company's troubles.
""Nissan's annual reports (over the past two years) did not give any hint that liabilities of the company would exceed its assets by 200 billion yen ($1.58 billion),"" he said.
On Friday, Japan suffered the first failure of a life insurance firm in its post-war history when Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co was ordered by the Finance Ministry to start shutting down its business.
The president of the medium-sized insurer, Hiroshi Yonemoto, said at a news conference that the company had been suffering from excessive liabilities for the last three to four years, stemming from the bursting of Japan's ""bubble era"" of inflated real estate and stock prices in the late 1980s.
""We sharply increased our assets during the bubble economy period, but the bubble burst and low interest rates have continued.""
He said that the company had taken restructuring steps, but gave up such efforts and continuation of its business due to a loss in the last business year ended March 31.
The Finance Ministry, for its part, pointed the finger of blame for the firm's failure at the management of Nissan Life.
The financial situation of Nissan Life is ""abnormal"" and management responsibility is ""heavy"", Makoto Fukuda, a senior Finance Ministry official, told reporters.
He said that the ministry had found that Nissan Life's financial condition was substantially worse then when it conducted an inspection of the company in September 1995.
But he added: ""In September 1995, we did not think its business was in a crisis.""
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka pledged to protect Nissan Life's policy holders and the Life Insurance Association of Japan, an industry body representing life insurers, said it would work out a liquidation scheme.
Kenjiro Hata, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, said that a scheme to wind up Nissan Life was expected to be ready in two to three weeks.
Hata told reporters that the insurance body wants to seek capital contributions from major clients of of Nissan Life, such as Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hitachi Ltd if a new company is set up to take over Nissan Life's business.
The insurer also owns shares in Nissan Motor and Hitachi.
However, industry sources said that it would take some time for the association to work out the scheme.
And even if a company is set up to take over Nissan Life's business, those life insurers who take over the policies of Nissan Life would have to bear a financial burden for a long time since nearly half of Nissan Life's assets are individual pension policies that have guaranteed high returns.
Normally, such high-yield policies account for only seven percent of a life insurer's assets. Protecting policy holders would mean guaranteeing the returns that have been promised until the policies mature, they said.
However, they said that members of the body, now totalling 44, would agree to cough up a total of 200 billion yen ($1.58 billion) to a new company to make up for the estimated excessive liabilities to protect Nissan Life's policy holders.
Earlier this month, ailing Nippon Credit Bank asked both life and non-life insurers to buy a total of 97 billion yen ($769 million) worth of ordinary shares to be newly issued under a radical restructuring plan which was supported by the Finance Ministry.

FumikoFujisaki,"Japan suffered the first failure of a life insurance firm in its post-war history on Friday, when Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co was ordered to start shutting down its business.
The Finance Ministry announced that it had instructed the medium-sized Tokyo-based life insurer to halt most business, except for servicing current customers, after the company said it had decided to wind up operations.
It was the first such order against a life insurance company since the nation's financial system was restructured after World War Two.
Financial analysts said the move would speed up a much-needed restructuring of Japan's life insurance industry.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference that his ministry had received a report from Nissan Life saying that it had come to a decision to discontinue business at an emergency board meeting held earlier on Friday.
""After receiving the report, I thought it was my duty as finance minister to deal with the problem in a swift manner and eliminate any worries,"" Mitsuzuka said.
Mitsuzuka pledged to protect all policyholders of Nissan Life in an attempt to avoid any resurgence of worries over the already fragile financial system, which has been hit hard by a series of bank failures and financial scandals.
But the Finance Ministry said it was not considering using tax money to liquidate Nissan Life as it did for failed ""jusen"" housing loan companies last year.
Mitsuzuka said Nissan Life's failure was due to its failure to manage its investment portfolio properly. Insurance companies typically rely on investment earnings for a large share of their earnings.
Mitsuzuka said there were no similar cases involving other Japanese life insurance companies.
Mitsuzuka said it was the first failure of a Japanese life insurance company in the postwar period and added: ""I hope to make it the last.""
Nissan Mutual Life suffered heavy losses through excessive stock and real estate investment during Japan's late-1980s ""bubble"" era of inflated asset prices.
A Finance Ministry official termed Nissan Life's financial situation ""abnormal"", with its liabilities exceeding assets by about 200 billion yen ($1.58 billion).
Although the firm had been striving to improve its business by itself, the hefty financial burden made it difficult for it to continue business.
Mitsuzuka said the ministry was preparing to announce who would manage the company's insurance policies and added that the life insurance association would likely become involved.
But he added that further discussions would be held on how to transfer insurance policies to other companies.
The news came as a surprise to the financial markets but there was no big sell-offs of shares or bonds and the Nikkei stock index ended the morning session with a small gain.
""The impact of Nissan Life was unexpectedly small, and that gave relief to the market,"" said Seiki Orimi, manager of the stock information service office at Dai-Ichi Securities Co Ltd. ($1=126 yen)
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Sanwa Bank Ltd, one of Japan's top banks, intends to list its shares in New York as soon as possible in a bid to become a truly global player in the financial sector, its president said on Wednesday.
""We want to do so as early as possible.  We need to take various forward-looking measures including the listing (in New York),"" Naotaka Saeki told Reuters in an interview.
Sanwa Bank is one of Japan's six biggest commercial banks, with assets of 51.96 trillion yen at the end of last September.
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd is the only Japanese bank listed in New York.
Financial sources said that Sanwa could not be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, however, until it had recorded a profit for three consecutive years.
After posting a parent current loss of 259.87 billion yen in 1995/96 to write off massive problem loans, including loans to failed mortgage firms, or ""jusen"", Sanwa has forecast a parent current profit of 50 billion yen for 1996/97, which ended March 31.
In 1996/97 Sanwa is disposing of 450 billion yen in problem loans, which would cover 48 percent of its estimated problem loans as of the end of March. The bank is scheduled to announce its 1996/97 business results later this month.
Saeki said he would not, however, declare that the bank's problem-loan mess was behind it.
He added that while the bank has been preoccupied with the disposal of problem loans for the past few years, it will now aim to boost its return-on-equity (ROE) ratio, a gauge of the efficiency of the use of capital, to 12 percent.
It also aims to increase its international capital adequacy ratio to 10 percent from an estimated 9.0 percent at the end of March 1997, he said.
Saeki added that the possibility of a major Japanese bank failure has virtually disappeared, as Japan's big banks have largely completed preparations to meet the stiff requirements to be imposed under the nation's early warning system, scheduled for launch in April 1998.
He added, ""Land prices are thought to have bottomed out, so the environment has also changed.""
Asked if Sanwa is seeking a merger partner, Saeki stated that the bank had no such intentions.
""In the past, in regulated markets, our predecessors might have thought that bigger is better. But now, with deregulation, we have various options,"" he said.
Even if a big Japanese bank merged with another big one, it would have few advantages in Japan because it is difficult to cut payrolls given Japan's social conventions, he said.
Saeki added, however, that Sanwa may form alliances with foreign financial institutions in specialised areas such as overseas leveraged buy-outs and mergers and acquisitions.
He also said that Sanwa would seriously study the possibility of setting up a financial holding company following the expected lifting of Japan's ban on such companies as part of its deregulation drive.
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Japanese life insurers may ask for support from banks to liquidate failed Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co, industry sources said on Friday.
While life insurers have basically agreed to provide a total of 200 billion yen to help liquidate the firm, they are worried whether their contributions will be enough to cover losses resulting from the failure, they said.
Nissan Life was ordered by the Finance Ministry to start shutting down its business on April 25. It was the first failure of a life insurance firm in Japan in the post-war period.
Nissan Life's liabilities were estimated to have exceeded its assets by 200 billion yen.
""If the life insurance industry alone cannot cover the losses, we may ask for some kind of support from banks which have business ties with Nissan Mutual Life,"" one industry source said.
He said that there were more than 100 banks and credit associations with business ties to Nissan Life.
Koichi Yoshida, the president-designate of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co, said this week that banks should help sort out the collapse of Nissan Life.
An official at the Life Insurance Association of Japan, which was appointed by the Finance Ministry to work out a scheme to wind up Nissan Life, said it had not yet done so as it was still examining the firm's financial situation.
It will take three weeks or more to complete the inspection, the official said.
Association chairman Kenjiro Hata told reporters last month it may also seek capital contributions from major clients of Nissan Life -- Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hitachi Ltd.
Industry sources said that Nissan Life policy holders would probably be asked to accept an increase in premiums or cuts in payments.
They said that the most likely liquidation scheme would involve the establishment of a joint company to take over Nissan Life's assets.
However, one estimate had shown that the new company could post losses of some 30 billion yen a year if conditions of existing insurance contracts were not changed, the sources said.
Nearly half of Nissan Life's 2.1 trillion yen in assets are individual pension policies that have guaranteed high returns. Many were contracted in the late-1980s bubble economy era.
When interest rates fell and the stock market languished following the collapse of the bubble economy, a large gap developed between investment yields and guaranteed returns to policy holders.
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Punitive actions by Japan's Finance Ministry against scandal-tainted Nomura Securities Co Ltd are unlikely for some time, even if Japan's securities watchdog files a complaint against Nomura this week with prosecutors, government sources said on Monday.
""The SESC (the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission) usually recommends punitive action to the Finance Minister after prosecutors complete their investigation of a case and decide whether to issue an indictment or not,"" one source said.
How long it takes prosecutors to complete their investigation is expected to depend on how far they intend to pursue the case, he added.
Over the weekend, Japanese newspapers reported that the SESC plans to file a complaint this week with prosecutors against former Nomura executives and against Nomura itself, after which Tokyo prosecutors plan to launch a full-scale investigation of the Nomura scandal.
Comment was not available from the SESC on Monday.
Since late March, prosecutors and the SESC have been investigating Nomura's role in suspected illegal payments to a corporate client linked to a ""sokaiya"" racketeer.
Government sources said that Nomura is suspected of violating the Securities and Exchange Law, by illegally using discretionary stock dealings to compensate the corporate client for stock trading losses, and the Commercial Code, by indirectly offering profits to the sokaiya.
""Sokaiya"" extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting or by offering to prevent a disruption of the proceedings by shareholders critical of the company. Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to such racketeers since 1982.
By way of example, financial sources noted the case of a smaller brokerage, Chiyoda Securities Co Ltd, that was ordered by MOF in mid-March, 1996 to suspend some of its business.
The SESC had first asked prosecutors to bring criminal charges against Chiyoda as early as December 1995.
The SESC waited until Chiyoda itself and five executives were indicted in February, 1996, however, before making a proposal to MOF on penalising the brokerage.
Media reports in recent days suggested that the scope of the Nomura scandal was widening.
The Mainichi Shimbun reported on Monday that there were more than 20 Nomura accounts linked to ""sokaiya"" racketeers in 1995, not including the racketeer at the centre of the current scandal.
Nomura declined to comment, stating that the company views the Mainichi report as linked to the current incident under investigation by Japanese regulators. He also said that the company could not comment on accounts of its customers.
Mainichi said those accounts were opened at Nomura before 1991, when the brokerage was hit by a scandal involving improper payment of compensation for preferred customers' losses and revelations of deals between its affiliates and gangsters.
Mainichi quoted unnamed sources as saying that, after the 1991 scandal, Nomura cancelled accounts of problematic clients but it could not cut its relationship with racketeers.
It also quoted a former Nomura executive saying that Nomura transferred profits from trading on its own account to those racketeer-linked accounts, due to its desire to avoid any troubles at its annual shareholders' meetings, it said.
In the past month Japanese media have also reported that Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB) made loans to the corporate client to help the sokaiya secure 300,000 Nomura shares in 1989, which gave him the right to propose the dismissal of executives at shareholders' meetings.
The newspapers have also said that prosecutors are investigating DKB loans for a possible link between the racketeer and the bank.
DKB repeatedly declined to comment on the reported loans.
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Losses have mounted in a stock market slump that has dragged on for years, yet Japanese securities brokers still cling on.
But expected liberalisation of brokerage fees could be the final blow for some of the weaker securities houses.
Analysts and industry sources say small Japanese brokers are seriously considering closing down amid fears of a plunge in revenues from commission fees, and foreign brokerages are taking a more positive look at the advantages of acquiring local brokers.
""The number of Japanese brokers will likely fall to half the current level over the next five to 10 years,"" an official at a Japanese securities house said. ""Many small brokerages are likely to close down or to be liquidated.""
As seen in Europe and North America, some analysts say revenues from commission fees will fall by at least 30 percent within one or two years of deregulation, while others say they could fall by half within the initial year.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a five-year ""Big Bang"" plan last November to enable Japan to catch up with reforms carried out a decade ago in Europe and North America.
Japan will finalise procedures next month to implement the reforms, which include the timing of liberalising commissions and breaking down barriers between financial sectors. They may also include abolishing a system under which brokers must operate under licences granted by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), analysts say.
No Japanese brokers have voluntarily closed and handed back their licences to MOF since the licence system began in 1968.
But such moves are now in sight.
Industry sources say a small broker based in Osaka, Ogawa Securities Co Ltd, an affiliate of Yamaichi Securities, could be the first to go into voluntary liquidation, as Yamaichi may not give it financial aid.
Ogawa said last Thursday it had no plans at present to stop doing business. Yamaichi, meanwhile, says it is considering how it will deal with Ogawa's difficulties.
There are about 285 brokerages in Japan including 56 foreign firms, but only 25 brokers, all Japanese, are listed.
A senior MOF official told Reuters the ministry would accept voluntary liquidation by brokers. He added that brokerage fees should be liberalised in the final stages of the ""Big Bang"" process after other areas of the securities business have been deregulated.
""We are well aware that local brokers would face difficulties unless they are given a certain period of time to prepare for the liberalisation of brokering fees,"" he said.
Indeed, the financial strength of domestic brokers has deteriorated since the bursting of the late 1980s ""bubble"" of inflated asset prices.
Last month, the Big Four -- Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi -- and one of Japan's 10 second-tier brokerages, Kokusai Securities, announced parent current profits for 1996/97, ended March 31.
But the other nine second-tier brokers all said they expected parent current losses for 1996/97 due to stock price falls. They will announce their earnings figures this week.
Among the nine, Dai-Ichi Securities and Yamatane Securities said they would be reporting current losses for the seventh consecutive year.
Analysts say many of the second-tier brokers, which depend on stock commission fees for 50 to 60 percent of their revenues, are likely to eventually be acquired by big banks.
They also say medium-sized brokers face more urgent restructuring moves this year, such as mergers and seeking outside capital, because by law they must raise minimum capital reserves by the end of next March.
Meanwhile, one analyst said foreign brokerages and non-financial Japanese firms had begun seriously studying the possibility of taking over local brokers. ""Foreign securities houses are keen to strengthen underwriting and asset management businesses and they want to have more networks to do so.""
One solution for foreign brokerages worried whether they can cut payrolls to boost efficiency would be to increase the number of people working on a commission basis, he said.
""Japanese brokerages are now cheap. Even among second-tier brokerages, there are some firms you can buy for about 30 billion yen ($252 million),"" he said. ($1=119 yen)
"
FumikoFujisaki,"Japan's securities watchdog filed complaints with prosecutors Tuesday alleging that Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan's biggest brokerage, and three former executives made illegal to payments to a client.
While the regulators did not identify the client, he is believed to be one of Japan's ""sokaiya"" racketeers, who extort money from corporations by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings.
Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to such racketeers since 1982.
Government sources said the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission complaints allege that Nomura and the employees made illegal payments to the client totalling 49.7 million yen ($417,600).
It was the first time that regulators have charged that the company was itself involved in the scandal. Nomura has repeatedly denied any participation in the scam, saying it was the work of three former executives.
It is now up to prosecutors to determine if there is enough evidence to file charges in the case.
In a sign that the probe may have a sweeping impact on Nomura, the SESC said that some of the improper orders were handled by more junior employees, which could bring more names into the scandal.
Nomura issued a statement apologising for the scandal.
""We deeply apologise for the inconvenience the scandal has caused to our customers and the public,"" it said.
""We are taking the complaints seriously...We will make a 'fresh start' to prevent a recurrence of such events.""
The government sources said the SESC would start drawing up proposals for civil penalties against Nomura immediately. But they added that it was too early to say how long it would take the SESC to present the proposals to the Finance Ministry.
Market sources say the Finance Ministry may suspend part of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as punishment for the scandal.
That would be the heaviest ever penalty imposed on a securities firm in Japan.
The scandal has already casted a long shadow over Nomura's business and prompted many clients to shun the financial powerhouse.
In March alone, Nomura's current profit dropped to about half the usual monthly levels due to the scandal, which cut its brokerage commissions and its share of the underwriting market, a company executive said in April.
Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo bourse fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it had held since February 1992.
In the first fallout from the SEC action, the Ministry of Finance said late Tuesday that Nomura was being suspended from taking part in Japanese Government Bond auctions and underwriting activities.
Nomura's admission in March that two of its directors were involved in transferring Nomura money into the account of a corporate client linked to a sokaiya racketeer was a major blow to the image of the Japanese brokering industry.
In 1991, Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were found to be paying improper compensation to favoured clients. Top executives at Nomura resigned that year over payments and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.
Nomura made a sweeping reshuffle of its top management late last month in an effort to win back public trust in the wake of the scandal.
"
FumikoFujisaki,"The criminal complaint filed against Nomura Securities Co Ltd on Tuesday reveals a widening circle of players in a pay-off scandal that has rocked the firm, dashing its hopes for a quick end to the affair.
Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors alleging that Nomura, two former executives and a former general manager compensated a client for investment losses, government sources said.
The sources said what was unusual about the latest scandal were revelations that company executives had asked junior staff to conduct illegal deals to compensate clients for stock trading losses for a long time.
But the securities watchdog decided not to take action against the junior staffers involved in the illegal deals, the sources said.
""The SESC decided not file a complaint against Nomura staff who had been actually involved in the transactions,"" a government source said.
Besides the brokerage, the SESC took action against former Nomura directors Shimpei Matsuki and Nobutaka Fujikura, both of whom resigned on March 10 as directors after Nomura's internal probe found they had made discretionary deals banned under Japanese securities law and funnelled profits to the corporate client.
The other was former general manager Osamu Fujita, who made the transactions under Fujikura's orders, the sources said.
They also said that Nomura continued the practice of making illegal compensation payments even after it was involved in an industry-wide loss compensation scandal in 1991.
Since the scandal was revealed by Nomura itself on March 6, the company's executives, including then president Hideo Sakamaki, insisted that they believed only the two former directors were involved in the pay-offs.
Sakamaki has since been forced to step down to take responsibility for the scandal.
With the SESC's latest move, the focus has now shifted to when the Finance Minister will impose penalties on Nomura and how severe they will be.
Analysts said that Nomura's business results for 1997/98 will depend on when and how hard the Ministry of Finance (MOF) comes down on Nomura.
If administrative penalties are severe and the ramifications extend into the second half of 1997/98, Nomura may be forced to post losses in 1997/98, they said.
The Japanese watchdog lacks the right to take punitive action itself but can recommend that the finance minister mete out administrative punishment and can ask prosecutors to take legal action against possible criminal violations.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka has said that the ministry would impose strict penalties against Nomura if the SESC were to propose that administrative action be taken against the company.
The sources said the securities watchdog would start drawing up its recommendations for penalties against Japan's top brokerage now that it had filed a complaint with prosecutors.
However, they said it was too early to say how long it would take the SESC to present its proposals to MOF.
A senior Finance Ministry official said after the scandal was revealed that MOF was focusing on whether Nomura had violated the commercial code, rather than the securities law. If the SESC investigation finds that pay-offs were made to a racketeer, the ministry will impose severe administrative penalties against Nomura, he said.
However, the client at the centre of the latest Nomura scandal was not included in the complaints, as the SESC could not confirm the role of the client.
In late March, prosecutors said that the client was linked to a ""sokaiya"" racketeer. Sokaiya extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting, and Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to racketeers since 1982.

GrahamEarnshaw,"Shanghai's port will be expanded to improve container handling and the approach channels will be deepened to accommodate large container ships, the port director said on Friday.
The port's container throughput rose 29 percent to 1.97 million units last year and should rise by a further 21 percent to 2.3 million units this year, director Du Deming said.
""The aim is to reach three million units by the end of the century but we could surpass that, we are doing the preparatory work to meet this challenge,"" Du said in an interview.
Shanghai port, China's largest, has been hampered for more than a century by shallow approach channels and silt build-up from the Yangtze River. Despite continual dredging the approches are only seven metres deep.
""We need to deepen the approaches by five metres, through a combination of engineering and dredging, to bring the depth of the approaches to 12.5 metres,"" Du said.
""The plan is to achieve this within the next 10 years. It will be a big project with several phases,"" he added.
Du declined to estimate the amount of investment required to achieve the plan, saying it was under study.
""Water depth is one of our biggest problems. We need to deepen the approaches as soon as possible to allow in the third-, fourth- and even fifth-generation container ships which can hold 5,000 containers and more,"" Du said.
Fifth-generation container vessels have visited Shanghai, but never fully loaded.
Du said investment in new facilities and reconstruction in Shanghai port would drop somewhat this year below last year's 1.1 billion yuan ($132 million), but that investment would resume growing in 1998. He declined to give details.
He said the port was trying to improve efficiency and had brought average ship turn-around times down to two days last year, a 10 percent improvement over 1995.
""We are inevitably competing for business with other ports in the region, and ship owners and cargo owners can make their own choice,"" he said. ""We need to improve facilities, equipment and particularly information systems.""
But Du said he did not see Shanghai port as competing with Hong Kong, which last year handled 13 million standard containers, more than six times the throughput of Shanghai.
""There is not much conflict. China is such a big country that both ports can continue to be prosperous. Hong Kong basically handles the south of the country, and Shanghai the Yangtze basin,"" he said.
Development of the deep-water port of Ningbo port 200 km (125 miles) south of Shanghai has often been tipped as the answer to the port congestion and silting that dog Shanghai, but Du was cautious on the issue.
""We're looking into it,"" he said. ""Shanghai and Ningbo should both be developed, there is not enough capacity in either to meet the demand.""

GrahamEarnshaw,"China's stock markets, greeting the Year of the Ox on Monday after a two-week lunar new year break, are expected to perform well through the year but with trading more subdued than last year, analysts said on Sunday.
The analysts said the two main positives for the China share markets this year were the country's strong economy and Beijing's apparent desire to have the financial markets on an upswing to mark Hong Kong's return to Chinese control on July 1.
But the ""Ox Year"" enthusiasm of stock investors was tempered by the determination of the Chinese securities authorities to push speculative funds out of the markets and make them less casino-like, they said.
""The major factor for the stock markets in the Year of the Ox will be the improved national economy,"" said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage.
""But we don't expect to see any dramatic surges like last year. The central government is stressing market stability,"" he said.
""The Hong Kong takeover will have a great psychological impact on the markets,"" a stock analyst said. ""I see most of (China's) share indices hitting record highs around the time of Hong Kong's return.""
Some brokers said they believed there would be a correction in April and early May in response to the generally poor 1996 results expected from listed companies.
But they said the markets were expected to perform strongly from June through to August during the period of the Hong Kong handover, and the rises could be sustained through the rest of the year assuming China's economy remained strong.
On the last trading day of the Year of the Rat on January 31, Shanghai's A share index closed at 1006.362 points against an historical high of 1640.710, while the B share index was 66.894 points against an all-time high of 105.780.
Shenzhen's A share index ended at 372.54 points against a record of 502.77 and the B index was 157.06 against 201.87.
The official China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday that the stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen could see an over-supply of share issues this year due to a big increase in listings combined with falling investor activity in equities.
The securities authorities set a new share issue quota at the end of last year of 10 billion yuan, double the previous quota.
""Demand for stocks was expected to wither after the market cooled down from excessive speculation,"" the newspaper quoted an expert as saying.
The authorities moved to rein in the share markets in mid-December after months of feverish trading which pushed prices up dramatically.
Many investors last year responded to two interest rate cuts by removing funds from their bank accounts to invest in the stock markets. But the China Daily said the impact of the rate cuts was fading.
The stock markets were also expected to suffer from the crackdown on the use of illegal funds to buy shares, particularly the use of credit, the newspaper said.
""Although there are no precise figures for illegal funds in the stock market, including overdrafts, corporation loans and banking deposits, the illegal money contributed significantly to the overheated market last year,"" it said.

GrahamEarnshaw,"Citibank NA on Monday started the move by foreign banks across the river to Shanghai's Pudong development zone, hoping to gain an early start in the local Chinese currency business.
But a senior Citibank executive at the formal opening of the Citibank branch office in Pudong said he saw only modest profit opportunities in the early stages of local currency operations.
John Beeman, Citibank's Country Corporate Officer for China told a news conference marking the branch opening that he expected the Chinese central bank to issue detailed regulations covering foreign banks doing Chinese yuan business in March.
""There will then be a thorough inspection of our branch premises and procedures. Assuming we pass the inspection, we hope to be able to offer (local currency) products and services in April,"" he said.
Citibank is one of eight foreign banks which have so far been given approval to do Chinese yuan business. Up to now, all foreign banks in China have been restricted to foreign currency transactions only.  
One of the main conditions attached to the right to do local business is that the chosen foreign banks must move their main operations to the Pudong district, which the Shanghai city government wants to develop into a financial centre.
Transport links to Pudong are currently undeveloped and the office vacancy rate in the main business area is estimated by real estate analysts at more than 70 percent.
Beeman said he did not expect much volume in local currency loans and deposits in the initial stages of Citibank's operations.
""On the scale (of the local currency business), our expectation at least for this year is that it will probably be relatively modest,"" Beeman said.
""On profitability, it depends how you do the accounting. But I would expect it to be profitable in terms of operating income almost from the beginning,"" he added.
Preliminary regulations issued by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, require the volume of Chinese yuan business be no more than 35 percent of the volume of a bank's foreign exchange business.  
They are also restricted to taking deposits and making loans to foreign-invested enterprises registered in Shanghai, and to Chinese firms that have obtained special approval.
Citibank is the only U.S.-based bank among the eight foreign banks so far granted permission to do Chinese yuan business.
Foreign bankers estimate that probably seven or eight other foreign banks with branches in Shanghai meet the financial and operational pre-conditions for applying to do local business.
But the requirement to move to Pudong presents significant problems for some banks in terms of dealing with their current office space, one European banker said.
""They have made it very clear that it is Pudong or nothing,"" the banker said. ""There is no flexibility at all. They have to move, which for some may not be easy.""
But Citibank's Beeman said he saw the Chinese banking authorities gradually relaxing restrictions and expanding the scope for foreign banks to do local currency business once they were satisfied with the way things were working.
""In China, it starts with a small group on an experimental basis until the authorities are satisfied things are running smoothly, then they expand it quite rapidly,"" Beeman said.

GrahamEarnshaw,"The jailing of one of the founding fathers of modern China's stock markets, announced this month, has sent a chill through the markets, with a clear message that no one is exempt, analysts said on Monday.
But they said the impact on prices from the sentencing of Guan Jiansheng, former head of top securities house Shanghai International Securities Co (SIS), would be minimal because of the careful timing of the announcement.
Official media announced on February 3, just ahead of the two-week Chinese lunar new year market holiday, that Guan had been sentenced to 17 years in prison for embezzlement and accepting bribes.
A Shanghai court convicted Guan of accepting 294,000 yuan ($35,000) in bribes and misappropriating 2.4 million yuan in public funds between 1992 and 1994, media reports said.
""Guan was one of the founders of China's modern stock markets and the heavy jail sentence has sent a chilly message to other major players on the stock markets,"" said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage.
""This is a warning to all brokerage officials intending to profit from illegal securities trading by taking advantage of their posts,"" said an analyst with China Guotai Securities in Shenzhen.
HG Asia's Shanghai respresentative Bruce Richardson said the Guan sentence was aimed at pulling the markets into line despite the relatively lax supervision.
""They're sending a message. There's a certain amount of bitterness among people who don't make a lot of money in China, and the heavy penalty shows these people that the government cares,"" he said.
A second Shanghai brokerage executive said Guan's sentencing fitted with the tougher attitude towards the stock markets being taken by the securities authorities in recent months.
""Beijing's crackdown on the stock markets recently makes it very clear that it is determined to bring them into line,"" he said. ""Beijing has made it clear that it will excuse no one. Guan has been selected to serve as an example to warn others.""
Guan, 49, was removed from his post as SIS president after the brokerage was implicated in a huge state debt futures trading scandal that rocked the Shanghai Stock Exchange in February 1995.
SIS took a bond futures contract position far exceeding the legal maximum and then tried to force down the market through massive dumping, which resulted in it suffering huge losses from selling short in a rising market.
The scandal prompted Beijing to ban state debt futures trading in May 1995 and SIS was later merged with the former Shanghai Shenyin Securities Co to form China's largest brokerage, Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities.
""Despite the severity of the sentence, the price impact on the markets will be minimal,"" said one Chinese stock trader. ""The markets had long expected Guan to be jailed.""
During the early 1990s, Guan helped make SIS China's top brokerage house and helped to work out the framework for China's modern securities markets, established in 1990.
Since late last year, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top securities watchdog, has taken tough and public action against around 30 branches of major Chinese banks and securities houses for illegal credit bidding on new issues.
It also fined Zhangjiajie Tourism Development Co Ltd for trading its own shares in the first such case in China's modern stock markets. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)

GrahamEarnshaw,"Share markets in and around China have again shown how sensitive they are to the health of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, but analysts said on Wednesday the issue was now emotional, with little economic significance.
Most stock markets in the China region gained ground on Wednesday after sharp losses on Tuesday sparked by a new bout of rumours that Deng's health was failing.
Beijing said there had been no major change in his condition.
""Old Deng's health is still the top political concern on the Chinese stock markets,"" said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage.
""The markets will continue to fluctuate sharply in the lead-up to his inevitable death,"" he said.
""Few investors (in the Chinese stock markets) expect his death will cause long-term social instability,"" he added. ""What they worry about is a short-term power struggle which will leave the stock markets in the cold.""
But foreign brokers in Shanghai said they saw the Deng factor as temporary, and weakening further as time went by.
""At this point, he is just an icon,"" said one foreign brokerage analyst. ""The impact gets weaker every time these rumours come out. It's just an emotional issue. People are looking for an excuse to take profits.""
Analysts in Taiwan agreed that the longer Deng lingered, the less the effect his death would have on the markets.
""It (the effect of his death) would depend on how Taiwan's markets themselves are doing at that time,"" said Allen Huang of National Securities. ""If it's as bullish as it is right now, the actual death probably wouldn't be that big a deal.""
""I don't believe his death will have a major impact because it has been written into people's equations for quite some time,"" said Richard Graham, representative of ING Barings.
""I would be surprised if it had much impact on the markets,"" he said.
Graham said foreign businesses were generally of the view that there were no signs of major political instability in China and that the current political leadership in Beijing led by President Jiang Zemin had a solid and stable hold on power.
In Shenzhen, a brokerage analyst said one result of the past couple of days could be a reduction in institutional activity on the stock markets until the situation became clearer.
""Investors are going to adopt a cautious stance towards trading amid worries over Deng's health,"" said an analyst with a major Chinese brokerage. ""Institutional investors will be reserved about buying until Deng passes away.""
Concerns about Deng's health continued to dampen sentiment in Hong Kong on Wednesday, where the Hang Seng index ended up just 3.38 points or 0.03 percent at 13,106.32.
""Until there is a clear confirmation about the political situation in China, I think the cautious sentiment will stay put,"" said Edward Chan, head of research at Amsteel Securities.
""Until investors have a better view on the political arena in China, I think the movement will be volatile,"" he added.
Analysts said the Hong Kong market could suffer a temporary slide if Deng died, but the reaction would be a symbolic, knee-jerk move and a further correction could become a buying opportunity.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"After an initial kneejerk fall in stock prices, China financial markets handled the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping calmly on Thursday, but analysts warned that trading could be volatile for some time to come.
Some foreign brokers predicted strong buying by foreign investors over the coming days with the removal finally of the shadow of the ""Deng factor"".
Nearly all Shanghai's shares opened in the morning at the 10 percent limit-down level with their Shenzhen counterparts also falling sharply on initial jitters over Deng's death.
But the markets quickly rebounded and by the end of trading, Shanghai's domestic A share index was up 0.28 percent at 1007.731 points and the foreign currency B share index edging down 0.7 percent to 64.675 points.
Shenzhen's B share index ended up 1.26 percent to 143.53 points while the A share index lost 2.11 percent to 350.59 points.
Alex Conroy, stock analyst with ING-Barings in Shanghai, said the sequence of a fall followed by a rebound in the aftermath of Deng's death had long been expected, but the speed of the reaction was surprising.
""It's happening a bit faster than I expected,"" she said.
Brokers said prices were supported by widespread bargain hunting and heavy support-buying by domestic institutions.
But they said investors would be watching Beijing for a clear indication that the final transition of political power to the next generation of leaders, led by Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, was as smooth as most market analysts expect.
On China's largest state debt market in Shanghai, most treasury bill spot contracts ended up after an initial sharp loss with most investors expecting no big changes in policy despite Deng's death, traders said.
The foreign exchange market was unaffected by Deng's death with the central bank firmly in control of price movements, traders said. The Chinese yuan closed up at 8.2939 on Thursday from Wednesday's 8.2945 against the U.S. dollar.
China's commodity futures markets were also untouched with technical factors dominating, traders said.
""Despite the first day's calmness, we expect some volatile trading on thin volumes on the financial markets in the next few weeks,"" said a Chinese banker.
""The most important market stabiliser will be signs from the central government that the power transition is progressing smoothly,"" he added.
Deng died late on Wednesday from respiratory failure. He was 92.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"China's financial markets breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping removed a major element of uncertainty that had overshadowed them for years, analysts said.
The single most sensitive and volatile factor for the markets in and around China in recent years had been the health of Deng.
Suddenly, it's not there any more.
""The official announcement has finally removed the main disturbing factor in the markets for the past few years,"" said a Hong Kong stock analyst based in Shanghai.
""It's the start of a new era. The new focal point of concern will hopefully be more economic fundamentals,"" the analyst said.
Local Chinese brokers agreed that Deng's death late on Wednesday removed a key negative factor from the markets.
""His health has long loomed large on the markets,"" said one stock analyst in Shanghai.
Bruce Richardson, Shanghai representative of HG Asia, said traders were relieved the wait was over.
""For years, people have been saying that when he goes there will be a deep drop which will present a buying opportunity. I'm a little surprised that the markets have digested the event so quickly,"" Richardson said.
""It shows that people are taking a forward-looking attitude. sentiment is very positive all around,"" he added.
Stock markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan moved higher on Thursday after gyrating wildly at the opening after the news.
Hong Kong stocks had jumped 1.96 percent or 256.96 points, by midday after an initial loss of 92 points. The weighted index in Taiwan rebounded from an earlier fall to close 21.19 points, or 0.28 percent, higher at 7,678.04.
The Shanghai foreign currency B index was up 0.29 percent or 0.188 points at 65.318 while Shenzhen was up 0.63 percent or 0.89 points at 142.64.
Some analysts have predicted a power struggle in the wake of Deng's demise while others viewed the current leadership structure headed by Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin as being basically stable.
China markets would now be looking for signs to indicate which group of pundits was correct, analysts said.
""The main concern is political instability,"" said a broker in Shenzhen. ""People will be watching to see what measures the government takes over the next few days.""
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"Foreign business people said on Friday they expected Deng Xiaoping's death to have almost no affect at all on either economic policies or the immense problems they face in making money in China.
Analysts said foreign money had now become an indispensible part of the government's efforts to keep unemployment down and the economy growing, and there was no prospect of any fundamental shift.
Lance Browne, Standard Chartered Bank's China manager, said he expected no change in policy toward foreign banks, nor in the speed and extent to which they can expand their business in China.
""It could hardly be any slower, and speeding it up, that's unlikely too,"" he said.
""Business people at this point see virtually no impact on their operations, either with regard to policy or the problems they face,"" said a Western diplomat in Shanghai.
Foreign businesses have been placed under ever-greater profit pressure in the past year as various preferential policies applied previously have been cut back or abolished to give domestic companies greater room to manoeuvre.
""There could be a further tightening of policy on the privileges applied, but that was going on before and has nothing to do with the death of Deng,"" the diplomat said.
Deng, China's paramount leader, died late on Wednesday aged 92.
An American businessman in the automobile sector in Shanghai said he saw no impact from Deng's death, but reported an increasing sense of concern among foreign business about the problems of getting approvals and making a profit in China.
""People are investing heavily, but there is a great sense of disappointment and unhappiness,"" he said.
""This has nothing to do with Deng, but it will be important to see how the leadership absorbs this,"" he said.
Hoong Yik Luen, investment analyst with ING-Barings in Shanghai, said foreign funds had become a key part of government efforts to keep the economy growing and unemployment down.
""They wouldn't be able to change the policy on foreign investment, they couldn't afford it,"" he said. ""Unemployment would probably be 20 percent now instead of 15 percent if it wasn't for foreign investment.""
An investment analyst based in Hong Kong said major foreign corporations were committed to investing in China almost regardless of what happens.
""The fact that there has been almost no impact on investment flows from the roll-back on the preferential policies shows how much momentum investment has, and there's no reason for the Chinese to shift their policy on taking in money,"" the analyst said.
""I see no change at all in the short term,"" said Standard Chartered's Lance Browne.
""There hasn't been a sense that the reforms are controversial inside the leadership for years. Had it been controversial, it would be different,"" he said.
But Chinese officials appear to be concerned about the topic.
One foreign businessman said he had been visited by officials asking for his view on the possible impact of Deng's death on foreign investment in the country.
""They are asking the same questions you are asking -- what effect Deng's death will have on investment decisions,"" the businessman, who declined to be named, said.
""I told them the feeling was that there would be no effect,"" he added.
""But of course it could be the calm before the storm. We'll have to see how strong the leadership looks in six months. There are always people in the wings who would like to replace them,"" he said.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"China's stock markets began returning to normal on Friday with all indices closing up in steady trade after the negative impact of the death of Deng Xiaoping faded from view, analysts said.
Retail investors and institutions began building positions reflecting the sentiment that Deng's death would actually benefit the markets in the longer term by removing a major negative factor, they said.
At the close on Friday, Shanghai's foreign currency B share index rose 0.894 points, or 1.38 percent, to 65.569 points while the domestic A share index closed at a year high of 1,063.276, rising 55.545 points, or 5.51 percent.
In Shenzhen, the B share index rose 7.43 points, or 5.18 percent, to 150.96 and the A share index zigzagged up 8.68 points, or 2.48 percent, to 359.28.
""Trading has returned to normal,"" said one Shanghai trader. ""Investors don't believe there will be any major policy change after Deng's death.""
""Some investors believe Deng's death will benefit the markets by removing a major negative factor for good,"" he said.
""The bad news has been digested,"" a Shenzhen-based analyst with Central-South Securities said. ""The Shanghai stock market performed well because investors can see a smooth leadership transition taking place.""
""People feel today that there is a stable political transition and the government is gaining credibility,"" another Shenzhen analyst said. ""Medium and long-term investors are beginning to pour in funds.""
Shanghai brokers said securities houses in the city convened meetings on Thursday which agreed on the necessity to keep the markets moving normally, but decided not to intervene to support the markets.
But some analysts said they suspected the markets were in one way or another receiving support from institutions under instructions to ensure no major market movements in the aftermath of Deng's death.
""I still think there may be some government support in this,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""The official intention is to ensure that normalcy is maintained.""
Analysts said the relatively short mourning period before Deng's funeral on Tuesday indicated China wanted to dispel the gloom as quickly as possible, helping to creating favourable investment conditions.
""The stock markets in China are very sensitive to political conditions,"" said another Shanghai trader. ""The impression that China is on the right track towards a smooth transition has helped the markets to recover swiftly.""
Other brokers have warned that there was still potential for market volatility in the short term.
""I will have to wait until the end of the mourning period to see clearly where the market is heading,"" the Shenzhen-based analyst said.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"Reform of China's non-equity capital markets is expected to push ahead over the next year with little or no impact seen from the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, industry analysts said on Friday.
Trading on the state debt and local currency interbank markets has been hardly affected by Deng's death and the analysts said they believed Beijing would not postpone their development, particularly efforts to greatly expand the interbank market.
""Trading has been normal although volume has dropped a little in the past few days,"" said one Shanghai-based interbank trader. ""We can see no major policy changes likely to affect the markets in the medium term.""
""The markets see signs that there will be a smooth transition of leadership,"" said a state debt trader. ""This belief has helped prices of state debt spot contracts to stand firm in the past two days despite Deng's death.""
But a senior China analyst for a brokerage in Hong Kong said she saw the death of Deng possibly leading to a slowdown in the pace of reforms of the capital markets.
""This is a big year for them -- they have the return of Hong Kong, the 15th Communist Party Congress and now absorbing the death of Deng to deal with,"" she said.
""That's a fairly heavy programme already. So this is not the year when you are going to institute major banking reform, for instance,"" the analyst said. ""Stability is the buzzword at the moment.""
On China's largest state debt market in Shanghai, most treasury bill spot contracts closed up for successive days on Thursday and Friday after brief losses in early trading on Thursday on Deng's death.
Daily turnover on the Shanghai-based China national local currency interbank market has been light, with institutions reluctant to build heavy positions on Deng's death.
But interest rates on the market have not changed much, indicating a confidence in medium-term prospects, traders said.
""Despite Deng's death, most investors are confident that the government will have no problem at all to redeem the state debt on maturity,"" said a second state debt trader.
""They also expect future state debt issues to have lower interest rates because of China's falling inflation on the back of the improved economy,"" he said. ""These factors have pushed up the existing state debt spot contracts in the past two days.""
Retail price inflation fell to a year-on-year 6.1 percent in 1996 from a year-on-year 14.8 percent in 1995.
Traders said the state debt repurchase markets in China had also performed well in the past few days despite Deng's death with normal trading on the nation's domestic A share markets backing up rates and volumes on the repo market.
On Tuesday, a day ahead of Deng's death, the Finance Ministry announced it would issue a total of 123 billion yuan ($14.8 billion) treasury notes from March 1 to October 20, the largest single batch of state debt issue ever announced since China resumed such issues in the early 1980s.
""The timing of the announcement has indicated that the state debt market will continue as planned,"" said a securities analyst. ""It has also signalled that other financial reforms promised will be implemented.""
These include a plan to drastically expand the nation's local currency interbank market, possibly by admitting major securities houses as market members, analysts said.
The market now has only 19 state banks and 35 short-term financial centres, money brokerages run by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, as its members.
Turnover on the market is currently only around three billion yuan per day, far below the level at which the market can attain the official goal of being a barometer of national short-term money movements, traders said.

GrahamEarnshaw,"The Chinese yuan will remain stable despite the death this week of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, dealers said on Friday.
They said the currency would likely stay steady not so much because of the growing sense China will remain politically stable but because of the central bank's complete dominance of the market.
The current trend in the Chinese currency is as it has been for the past year and more -- slow but steady strengthening against the U.S. dollar on the back of China's growing trade surplus and heavy flow of foreign investment dollars, they said.
The yuan closed little changed at 8.2940 on Friday from Thursday's level of 8.2939 against the U.S. dollar on the Shanghai Foreign Exchange System.
""There will be little change in the central government or in economic policy as Deng has not really been in power for a long time,"" said one dealer.
""People had been prepared for the news for a long time, so there was no strong response visible on the market,"" he added.
Another dealer said that any sense of political uncertainty could give rise to greater selling of the yuan by foreign companies.
""But even in the case of some political instability, the possibility of which is pretty small, the Chinese yuan will still be stable given the full control of the central bank,"" he said.
Trading volumes on the Shanghai Foreign Exchange System, through which the yuan's rate against the U.S. and Hong Kong dollars and the Japanese yen is reflected, are very small, amounting to only $200 million to $300 million each day on average.
""Given the foreign exchange reserves, the central bank has ample ability to control the market trend, said one trader.
The latest figures released by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, show the country's foreign exchange reserves stood at $105 billion at the end of 1996.
Dealers said the yuan's gradual rise was likely to be contained within a range between 8.2800 to 8.3100 to the dollar over the next few months.
Zhou Xiaochuan, vice-governor of the People's Bank, said last month the central bank would step up intervention on the foreign exchange market to prevent the yuan from rising sharply.
""There is an oversupply of U.S. dollars on the market due to the trade surplus and continued in-pouring of foreign investment, but investor concerns over central bank intervention will curb its rise,"" said one dealer.
According to official figures, China posted a trade surplus of $12.24 billion in 1996 and it is expected to grow to $17.4 billion in 1997. Official forecasts put direct foreign investment in China in 1997 at $49.5 billion, up 15 percent from last year.
China's exports in January 1997 rose 27.5 percent to $11.69 billion while imports fell 1.29 percent to $9.98 billion, creating a trade surplus of US$1.71 billion against a deficit of $938 million in January 1996, customs figures showed.
Dealers said the average export cost of foreign exchange stood at around 8.38 yuan for each dollar of exported goods in 1996, making exporters lose money when they turn trade surplus dollars into local currency at the current exchange rate.
""If the exchange rate rises further, exporters will lose more, which is a key factor for curbing the yuan's rise,"" said one dealer.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"China's stock markets began returning to normal on Friday with all markets up in steady morning trade as the negative impact of the death of Deng Xiaoping faded from view, analysts said.
Both retail investors and institutions began building positions reflecting the sentiment that Deng's death would actually benefit the markets in the longer term by permanently removing a major negative factor, they said.
By midday on Friday, Shanghai's foreign currency B share index was up 0.666 points or 1.03 percent to 65.341 points and the domestic A share index was up 31.437 points or 3.12 percent to 1039.168.
In Shenzhen, the B share index rose 3.97 points or 2.76 percent to 147.50 points and the A index was up 2.45 points or 0.7 percent at 353.05 points.
""Trading has returned to normal,"" said one Shanghai trader. ""Investors don't believe there will be any major policy change after Deng's death.""
""Some investors believe Deng's death will benefit the markets by removing a major negative factor for good,"" the trader added.

Other brokers have warned that there was still potential for markets volatility in the short term.
""I will have to wait until the end of the mourning period to see clearly where the market is heading,"" the Shenzhen-based analyst said.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"China looks likely to slow the pace of reform in its financial markets, the late Deng Xiaoping's most startling experiment, as his successors make stability their top priority this year, analysts said on Sunday.
China's leaders already have enough on their plates -- the return of Hong Kong from July 1, the ruling Communist Party's 15th Congress later in the year and task of consolidating their power in the aftermath of Deng's death last Wednesday.
Bold and ambitious new reforms in the financial sector are unlikely to occur before these more pressing items are out of the way, but pressure to move ahead will build during the year, the analysts said.
""I think for the coming months up to the Party Congress, the intention will be to keep things tight,"" said one European banker. ""But once the congress is out of the way, they will want to speed it up again.""
An analyst working with a Shanghai brokerage said the authorities could be expected to be cautious on issuing new regulations and initiating new changes in the foreseeable future, but added: ""The main policy will not change.""
""The development of the stock market will not change despite the news (of Deng's death),"" said one trader. ""But to maintain the stability of the market, the government will not announce any big changes in the immediate future.""
The chance of a roll-back in the overall trend towards bigger, more sophisticated and regulated financial markets seems even more unlikely.
China's stock, futures and capital markets sprang out of Deng's comment in the early 1990s that capitalist-style markets might be worth trying.
""If, after one or two years of experimentation, they prove feasible, we can expand them. Otherwise, we can put a stop to them and be done with it,"" Deng said.
But as Deng probably guessed when he said it, once the markets' juggernaut got under way, it was probably impossible to do much more than guide it.
""The markets are still experimental to some extent, but closing them down is less and less of an option as time passes,"" the banker said.
The Beijing leadership is faced with a host of pressing issues related to the financial markets.
The markets are still waiting for the release of the long-delayed Securities Law, Futures Law and Investment Fund Law, all basic building blocks of the financial industry.
Foreign bankers and insurers are impatient about the snail's pace at which China's financial sector is being opened up.
The futures markets are so constrained by policy that they are scarcely able to fulfil their function -- the hedging of risk, traders say.
Stock brokers complain about the bureaucratic way in which companies are chosen for listing, resulting in too many poor quality firms being listed too slowly.
And the huge problem of heavily indebted state-owned enterprises is still there waiting to be resolved.
""The need is there, there is an enormous need to address the issues,"" the banker said. ""But the political situation has not been stable enough for people to attack the knotty decisions.""
""Stability is the top requirement for now. Any sign of weakness could trigger something unexpected,"" he added.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"Trading on China's capital markets will be dominated this week by technical factors with the death of Deng Xiaoping last Wednesday already well discounted as a factor, analysts said on Sunday.
They said the unexpected calm and maturity of trading on the stock, state debt and currency markets on Thursday and Friday ensured smooth entry into trading on Monday.
Investors are watching for signs of shifts in the policies or leadership of the country, but there was a growing sense among analysts that in the short term at least, there is little chance of any political problems emerging to shake the markets.
""The markets will trade...without impact from Deng's death,"" said a stock analyst with a major Chinese brokerage. ""I would say it will be at least a month before any new leadership appointments or changes are made in Beijing.""
""During this period, trading volumes are expected to be low with investors reluctant to build heavy positons due to overall market uncertainties,"" he added.
A state debt trader said: ""The markets had expected Deng's death to be this year's biggest negative impact, but it turned out that the impact was unexpectedly short-lived.""
""We now believe the markets will be more affected by changes in financial policies, such as re-adjustment of bank reserve ratios, than by post-Deng politics,"" she added.
Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets rose on Thursday and Friday despite Deng's death, with investors seeing no signs of immediate political instability and expecting a continuation of Deng's reformist policies, analysts said.
Volumes on the state debt markets dropped a little, but trading was otherwise unaffected by Deng's death, traders said.
Spot contracts gained some ground late last week on rumours that the People's Bank of China, the central bank, would soon cut bank interest rates and bank reserve ratios.
Interest rates on China's local currency and foreign exchange interbank markets also saw little impact, traders said.
Some brokers said the stock market may be entering a phrase of consolidation in the near term.
""Technical charts indicate there will be a big correction around the middle"" of this week, a stockbroker said. ""This will be the key factor.""
""The company reporting season is getting into full swing,"" said another broker. ""The stock markets will have difficulty rising solidly in the near term with so many listed firms expected to post poor results for 1996.""
The Finance Minstry announced last Tuesday it would issue a total of 123 billion yuan ($14.82 billion) in treasury notes from March 1 to October 20, the largest batch of state debt issued since China resumed such sales in the early 1980s.
Traders said the coupons for the latest batch had been set low due to falling inflation and this would become the major factor for the state debt spot market this week.
""The existing contracts have much higher yields against the new issue and they will rise..., brushing aside the Deng factor,"" one trader said.
A trader on the Chinese yuan interbank market said a possible cut in bank reserve ratio would be the single most important factor to affect the market in the next month or so.
""We believe there will be no more Deng impact over this period,"" he said.

GrahamEarnshaw,"China's growing army of young urban professionals, mobilised by the reforms of deceased leader Deng Xiaoping, are fighting for wealth and success in a world undreamed of by their communist forebears.
Their weapons are the cellphone, the well-cut suit and the right accessories. Their goal is a better life -- or at least a better apartment.
""Making more money and seeking personal success is everyone's target, and no one feels any reluctance about admitting it,"" said a twenty-something university graduate working for a foreign insurance company in Shanghai.
They would have done in the days before Deng, who broke China out of its isolated and poverty-stricken Maoist mould.
But where capitalist-style self-interest would once have earned anything from harsh criticism to labour camp, the rat race now has China's official endorsement.
Chinese yuppies -- university educated, better informed and more independent-minded than their parents -- are most visible in Shanghai, the heart of China's economic boom.
Suits and beepers are required accessories, although BMW cars are still some way off. In sparkling glass towers that rival those of Hong Kong and Singapore, China's new breed of urban professionals is plotting the future.
Many work for foreign companies, earning a monthly income of at least 2,500 yuan ($301), more than 10 times the average income of Chinese people.
""My salary is much higher than my parents but I still want to earn more money to become rich,"" said a computer engineer working with a foreign company.
In the days when the socialist planned economy ruled supreme in China, the only way for an ambitious young person to attain independent status and wealth was to go abroad. Things are changing.
""When I was in university, I thought going abroad was the only way to have a good career, but now I'd rather stay in China,"" said a young manager with a foreign bank in Shanghai.
""I want to be an expert in the banking industry, and my current job will allow me reach that target,"" he said.
The importance of this group of increasingly sophisticated and worldly professionals to China's future can hardly be over-estimated, analysts said.
""They are a very important group of people, the spearhead of development. It is they who are taking China into the new millennium,"" a European banker said.
He said young Chinese people were much less willing to take China's traditionally passive approach to dealing with authority.
""People are less compliant than several years ago. They have more to stand up for and more personal interests to defend,"" he said.
A decade ago, student graduates in China were assigned jobs by their university, and had little or no say in what positions they would move into. If they didn't like the work, they had to put up with it.
""In those days, if a person resigned from a job, it was hard to find another one,"" said a another mid-twenties yuppie working as a salesman with a British company.
""People thought that you would only quit a job if you had made some serious mistake. But now changing jobs is normal. It's got to the point where it is strange if you stick to one job for a long time, say over five years,"" he said.
Compared with the young people of a decade ago, members of China's current generation have immeasurably more freedom to plan their futures, and most put personal careers as their top priority.
""I found the job I have myself after graduating from university,"" said a secretary working with a Hong Kong-based company in Shanghai. ""If I am not satisfied with it, I can quit and try to find another one.""

GrahamEarnshaw,"China's stock markets saw heavy turnover on Monday but little change to the key indices as the impact of Deng Xiaoping's death faded and profit-taking set in, analysts said.
Investors expect little chance of any political problems emerging to shake the markets, at least for the next few weeks, they said.
""It seems to be all very stable,"" said stock analyst Alex Conroy with ING-Barings in Shanghai. ""I expect range trading for a while. There's no particular reason to be trading in a frenzy.""
Shanghai's domestic A share index edged down 0.77 percent to 1,055.078 points on heavy volume of 1.02 billion shares while the B share index was little changed at 65.707 points, inching up just 0.21 percent against the close on Friday last week.
In Shenzhen, the A index rose 0.95 percent to 362.69 points and the B index lost 0.15 percent to 150.73 points.
""The markets were under profit-taking pressure after the past two trading days of rises,"" said a Shanghai-based A share dealer with China Guotai Securities.
""Institutional speculative buying of heavily-weighted stocks pushed the (Shanghai B share) index up, but most investors took a wait-and-see attitude as Deng's death has been factored in and there is nothing else happening,"" said one broker.
Traders said the markets had expected Deng's death to be this year's biggest negative factor. But the relative calm in the market on Thursday and Friday following Deng's death on Wednesday has helped improve sentiment.
""Shenzhen's A share index extended gains into Monday with fewer worries about stability in China after Deng Xiaoping's death,"" said a Shenzhen-based broker.
Some stock analysts said the markets, in the near-term, would likely move in line with company results and technical factors.
""The most important factors in the short term will be company results with the annual report season now getting into full swing,"" said one analyst.
""The (Shanghai's B share) market has entered a correction peroid, and the performance of individual stocks will depend on their annual results,"" said a broker.
But others are more cautious.
""I expect most investors to stay on the sidelines in the next few days, waiting for market-moving incentives,"" a Shenzhen-based analyst with a major Chinese brokerage said.
""I would suggest investors have more cash in hand as market sentiment does not appear quite stable,"" a broker said.
The Shanghai Securities News on Monday predicted the stock markets will rise steadily in 1997 on the back of an improved national economy.
The newspaper forecast in a commentary that Shanghai's composite index would soon rise to more than 1,100 points. The index closed at 1,009.564 points on Monday.
""The improved macro-economy and financial conditions dictate that stock indices will have an upward trend in 1997,"" the newspaper said.

GrahamEarnshaw,"China's entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is likely to be one of the top issues for U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Beijing as the two nations draw closer on trade issues, analysts said on Monday.
Albright, on the last stop of a nine-nation tour, will meet President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other officials during her brief stay, cut short because of funeral arrangements for the late leader Deng Xiaoping, who died last Wednesday.
Discussions on China's admission to the global trade body, long delayed by disagreements over the terms, have gained momentum in recent weeks with U.S. officials saying China has indicated a willingness to drop more of its trade barriers.
""It's going to be one of the main items on the agenda, they're right in the middle of it,"" said a Western analyst in Shanghai.
""What people want is for the Chinese to sign on to the international standards of trade. It would be a very positive factor in relations (between China and the United States) if it was resolved,"" the analyst said.
Zhou Dunren, professor at Fudan University's American Centre, said WTO entry was the biggest problem facing China and the United States in the sphere of economic relations.
""But it looks very possible that China will gain entry to the WTO this year, even though it may be a conditional entry rather than full membership,"" he said.
""The U.S. attitude on China's entry was previously very tough, setting very high conditions. But now there appears to be basic support from the U.S. to China's entry, with the conditions being softened somewhat,"" Zhou added.
""There's no doubt that the middle ground is appearing and that that's attractive to everyone,"" said John Crossman, Shanghai representative for financial firm Jardine Fleming.
""I think we can look forward to a time when trade disputes aren't what drives the China-U.S. relationship. Now the contact is all negative,"" he said.
China has been seeking to join the world body on the easier terms offered to developing countries.
But the United States and other Western countries say the Chinese economy is too big, and that giving it preferential treatment would distort the global trading system.
U.S. officials declined to comment on the current state of discussions on China's WTO entry.
Professor Peng Fuyong of Shanghai's Finance University said China's eagerness to gain WTO membership had also diminished somewhat in recent months.
""One reason for the slowdown may be concerns that there are certain elements of the domestic economic structure which are not ready for WTO entry,"" he said.
""For instance, the state-run import-export firms and some industries are not at this point efficient enough to face the competition that would result from WTO entry,"" Peng added.
Zhou said bilateral trade overall was set to continue to grow strongly in the years ahead.
""When the Shanghai Communique was signed 25 years ago (setting the framework for normalising Sino-U.S. relations), trade between the two amounted to probably just a few million dollars a year. It hit $50 billion in 1996, and it looks like this trend will continue,"" he said.
According to U.S. figures, China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to about $38.9 billion in 1996, up from about $34 billion in 1995. Beijing's figures show a net trade deficit with Washington.
The main reason for the widely varying figures is that China does not count goods shipped through the British colony of Hong Kong in its U.S. trade data.
""The return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 provides an opportunity for the two sides to find a solution to this problem,"" said Zhou.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"The city of Wenzhou, a capitalist pioneer in socialist China, has decided the best way to mourn paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is to make more money, residents said on Monday.
""Without Deng, there would be no today's China and, especially, no today's Wenzhou,"" said advertising company manager Wu Hao.
Deng, who died on Wednesday aged 92, helped to steer China on its current economic course, wrenching it from purist Marxist policies that had brought the nation to the brink of starvation and industrial collapse.
Once a poor and backward city, Wenzhou has boomed since Deng's reform were launched in 1979, seizing new opportunities more aggressively than almost any other place in the country.
While top-level attention focused on four ""special economic zones"" such as Hong Kong's neighbour Shenzhen, which was created as a closely-monitored official experiment with capitalism, Wenzhou just went ahead and started making money.
Private firms in the city of seven million people on China's eastern coast, 350 km (217 miles) south of Shanghai, now account for 75 percent of Wenzhou's annual industrial output, compared to a national average of 10 percent.
""There is no way we could make as much money as we do, do so much business, if it had not been for Deng Xiaoping and the policy changes he pushed through,"" Zhou Ping, the owner of a small shoe factory, said in a telephone interview.
Another businessman in his twenties, asked about Deng's death, said getting rich was his top priority.
""It (Deng's death) has nothing to do with my business,"" he said. ""What I should do is first make more money, then find a wife and finally have a son.""
""Despite any possible changes in Beijing, there will be less control of the private sector at least in the short term, and there will be more opportunities for making money,"" he added.
Wenzhou's brand of freewheeling capitalism was born of poverty and desperation.
The city sits on the coast facing Taiwan, home of the Nationalist government which in 1949 fled to the island, now regarded by Beijing as a renegade province, after losing the civil war.
Fearing a continuation of the war, the new communist government neglected coastal regions, including Wenzhou which for many years received less than half the level of state investment other cities did.
When Deng's reforms were launched, Wenzhou embraced them with fervour -- so much so that the city was criticised for following a capitalist road instead of a socialist one.
But Deng's 1992 visit to the south of China in which he called for fast development of the market economy silenced the critics and allowed Wenzhou to charge ahead, said a Wenzhou businessman who was formerly an official with a state-run firm.
""It gave us the courage to do business whole-heartedly without having to worry about the political consequences,"" he said.
Local officials say that with the policies on private enterprise and the market economy increasingly stable on a national scale, Wenzhou is set for a ""second surge of development"".
""This new surge is making Wenzhou's private firms even bigger and more competitive,"" said the former official.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"China's stock markets rose calmly on Tuesday reflecting signs of political stability seen since paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died last week, analysts said.
Stocks rose in Hong Kong and fell in Taiwan, but for reasons that had little or nothing to do with politics in giant neighbour China, they said.
""Signs are clear during (China's) six-day official mourning period (from last Thursday to Tuesday) that political conditions are stable,"" said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage in Shanghai.
""The markets expect no sensational political news to shake them, at least for a few weeks,"" he added.
President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday offered unstinted praise for Deng during a funeral oration, saying the future lay with economic reforms pioneered by the strongman who died last Wednesday, aged 92.
Modern China's stock markets, established in 1990 under Deng's direction, only officially emerged from an ""experimental"" phase last year, with many investors still worried that Beijing could decide to close them down, brokers say.
""With Deng's death, investors are nervous about the continuity of policy,"" said the stock analyst. ""Normal trading today serves to stabilise sentiment.""
Shanghai's domestic A share index closed up 8.752 points, or 0.83 percent, at 1,063.83 while the foreign currency B share index ended up 0.589 points, or 0.9 percent, at 66.296.
In sothern Shenzhen, the A share index rose 6.02 points, or 1.66 percent, to 368.7 points while the B index edged up 0.14 points, or 0.09 percent, to 150.87.
""A sense of stability dominated the markets today partly due to the normal trading (hours),"" said a senior B share dealer. ""This helped the indices move up.""
Trading on China's two stock markets continued through the funeral ceremony for Deng in the morning, although volumes dropped significantly as traders and investors alike watched the live television broadcast.
""The central government wanted to tell millions of investors on the stock markets that they were determined to let the markets continue as before even though their creator is gone,"" said a stock analyst. ""All markets closed up today, which shows they succeeded.""
Traders said share prices were likely to rise steadily for at least the next few weeks on strong national economic prospects.
""Technical factors will prevail in the coming weeks,"" said a broker. ""Investors will buy blue-chip firms expected to post strong 1996 results. They have confidence in the national economy this year after its good performance last year.""
In Hong Kong, share prices rallied on Tuesday, with the Hang Seng Index closing up 144.57 points, or 1.08 percent, at 13,520.26 mainly due to gains in HSBC Holdings.
Brokers said China-related shares continued to attract keen interest and investors had been encouraged by Jiang's vows to push ahead with market-oriented reforms.
""This morning Beijing reiterated the open-door policy will still be maintained,"" said Edwin Cheung, dealing director at Taiwan Securities.
In Taipei, analysts said Deng's funeral had no impact on stock trading, with the weighted index falling 21.25 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,887.36.
""Nobody talked about it,"" said Allen Huang, fund manager for National Securities.
"
GrahamEarnshaw,"One of Shanghai's top businessmen said on Wednesday that he had no doubts or concerns about policy changes following the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping last week.
""All we want is stable government,"" said Zhang Xuexiong whose chocolate-making company is a major supplier of confectionary to the Shanghai market and one of the city's largest private companies. ""The rest we can handle with our own hands.""
Zhang is the owner of the Shanghai Haolaixi Food Co Ltd, which he started in 1989 with 90,000 yuan ($10,840) in capital.
It turned a 10,000 yuan profit in the first year and he hasn't looked back since.
Last year, the company had a profit of over one million yuan, which Zhang said he expects to rise to over three million in 1997.
""(Party chief) Jiang Zemin said quite clearly in his eulogy to Deng that multiple forms of production would continue to be allowed. There will definitely be no change in policy,"" he said.
Zhang was effusive in his praise of Deng and his contribution to making him a millionaire.
""If the policy had not opened up, we simply wouldn't exist,"" he said. ""Deng Xiaoping saw that it was essential to let people become prosperous before they would continue to support the rule of the Communist Party.""
The company has 380 workers, but in a classic capitalist entrepreneurial move, Zhang plans to fire more than half of them later this year when he installs automatic packaging machinery imported from the United States.
Zhang, aged 45, was one of many young people shipped out of Shanghai to work in the countryside during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He returned to his native city in 1984, and started a series of small restaurants and shops.
""But private enterprise was very tough in the 1980s, especially in Shanghai. It was only after Comrade Deng's speech in 1992 opening up economic development that things got moving,"" he said.
"
HeatherScoffield,"As Canada's budget deficit shrinks, politicians campaigning ahead of June elections are debating whether to cut taxes or raise government spending.
While many Canadians say they are desperate for tax relief, others are begging politicians to shun tax cuts and spend the extra money on social services.
""They have to stop talking about cutting taxes,"" one Toronto social worker said as Reform party leader and tax cut advocate Preston Manning spoke nearby at the kickoff of his campaign for the June 2 election.
""People want to hear about jobs and job creation. If you have a job you worry about keeping it, you worry about losing it,"" she told the Canadian Press news agency. Canada's unemployment rate is a stubbornly high 9.3 percent.
The governing Liberals on Sunday called for the June vote, just 3-1/2 years into their five-year term.
The two right-wing parties, Reform and the Conservatives, are touting their plans to cut taxes.
Canada has the highest personal income taxes among the seven leading industrial nations and the fourth highest among the member nations of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, according to an OECD study.
""(Conservative leader) Jean Charest believes that high taxes kill jobs -- that the economy needs tax cuts now to create jobs,"" the Conservatives' campaign literature says.
Reform lashed out at Liberal tax increases, accusing the centrist party of pushing through 31 tax hikes while in office. Reform has promised to cut payroll taxes and contributions to unemployment insurance, as well as simplify the income tax system.
In 1996, the average Canadian family's tax bill was about 48 percent of its income, a study released on Tuesday showed.
But the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) opposes tax cuts, saying right-wing platforms are irresponsible. The NDP actually wants to raise corporate and capital gains taxes.
The separatist Bloc Quebecois wants Ottawa to close tax loopholes for big business, while giving tax breaks to smaller firms to stimulate growth.
The Liberals are sandwiched between the right's call for tax cuts and the left's call for spending, and face different opinions in their own ranks on the issue.
They have taken a typical middle-of-the-road approach, advocating tax cuts once the deficit is licked and when health care and education are securely funded.
""The choice the other political parties are offering is to declare the job done before it truly is, to introduce a tax cut before the country can afford it,"" Finance Minister Paul Martin told a Montreal news conference on Tuesday.
""They would short-change our hopes for a stronger economy and for greater job creation.""
Martin said his party would lower taxes but only when the deficit was eliminated. Instead, his party announced on Monday they would not cut C$6 billion (US$4.3 billion) in health care funding, as had been planned.
Martin has predicted the deficit for the year ended March 31, 1997, would be less than C$16 billion ($11.4 billion), well below the original target of C$24.3 billion ($17.4 billion) for the year.
But the Conservatives argue that 87 percent of the deficit decline was due to higher taxes. They say real after-tax income has fallen from the early 1990s.
"
HeatherScoffield,"TVX Gold Inc is taking steps to join the ranks of major mining companies, bringing aboard three senior executives who pledge to turn the company into a million-ounce-a-year gold producer.
""We're here to help TVX grow,"" said Cliff Davis, the new senior vice-president of North American operations, among three officers who joined TVX in the past month.
""We understand the need for organization. We understand realistic plans. I think that's something we can help TVX with,"" Davis told Reuters in an interview.  
Davis's next plan is to speed production at the New Britannia mine in Manitoba and develop more reserves at Casa Berardi in Quebec.
Joining Davis at TVX are David Murray, the recently appointed president and chief operating officer, and Ken Sangster as senior vice-president of European operations.
The three have worked together before. They did stints at mining giant RTZ-CRA Corp Plc and have years of experience with huge projects.  
""For us it was a perfect fit,"" said TVX spokesman Ed Baer. ""One of the things that was a common concern to the market was our lack of management.""
Toronto-based TVX split off from Inco Ltd in 1993 and has concentrated on expanding its assets.
With its interests now growing in Canada, Greece, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, the Czech Republic and Russia, the company is ready to switch its focus to production, he said.
TVX has promised its shareholders it will be producing 1.1 million ounces of gold a year by the year 2000 from 423,000 ounces in 1995.  
To help keep its promise, the company has placed its bets on the Kassandra Mines in Greece. ""If everything works for us, the story really lies in Greece,"" said Baer.
The property so far is expected to produce 300,000 ounces of gold a year at a cash cost of US$150 an ounce. TVX was still drilling and would not have a clear idea until next spring what the deposit offered, said Baer.
Uncertainty over Kassandra has unsettled TVX stock. Its shares peaked at 14.85 in Toronto during a road show and high gold bullion prices last winter. But the stock has since slid.  
With its stock now trading around 10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and around 7.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, TVX has been rumored as a takeover target for some major gold producers.
But as a growing company, TVX is always looking for joint ventures and is on the prowl for small mining companies with proven reserves, Baer said.
Davis's first move at TVX was to shut the company's gold mine in Montana earlier this month.
The Mineral Hill mine drained money from the company for years. TVX hoped to revive it with additional ore found at nearby Crevice Mountain, but ore grades at Mineral Hill grew worse and the company could not keep its mill supplied.
Although the company continues to explore at Crevice, Davis did not hold out much hope for a resurrection of mining on the property.
""If it's what it appears to be, we won't reopen,"" he said.

HeatherScoffield,"The European Union's trade commissioner chided Canada on Thursday for its lack of action against the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which penalizes foreign firms for doing business in Cuba.
""We put our head above the block and Canada has declined to do so,"" Leon Brittan told reporters as he headed into quadrilateral trade talks with his counterparts in Canada, Japan and the United States.
""I find it a little curious that we have gone ahead and challenged the Uhited States, taken a very high-profile action and got some progress from the United States as a result of that, very substantial progress,"" Brittan said. ""Canada has held back on (action through) NAFTA.""
The European Union had threatened to challenge the United States through the World Trade Organization over the Helms-Burton law.
In April, the European Commission said it struck a deal with Washington, under which the EU agreed to suspend its action in the WTO and the U.S. government would continue to suspend a key clause in the Helms-Burton law.
The two parties would continue to discuss the anti-Cuba law through the multilateral investment agreement under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, rather than pursue the debate throught the WTO.
""There'd been a sort of informal understanding of the division of labor, that we would go ahead under the WTO and Canada would go ahead under NAFTA,"" Brittan said.
But Canada has hesitated to challenge the Helms-Burton legislation under the auspices of the North American Free Trade Agreeement.
""I've still got the NAFTA challenge in my back pocket,"" Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton told reporters. ""If things break down and don't proceed, then I can always use that.""
He said Canada wanted to participate fully in the negotiations under the OECD.
""As long as progress is being made, it serves no purpose to go ahead (with a NAFTA challenge) at this point in time,"" Eggleton said.
Eggleton also brushed off U.S. criticism of Canada's new copyright law, which imposes a C$0.50 tax on blank audio cassettes, with the revenue to be distributed to performers. But the royalties are not passed on to U.S. performers since the United States has not signed an international treaty on copyright.
Eggleton confirmed on Thursday that Canada was on a U.S. ""watch list"" for its copyright legislation, among other issues.
""They put out a watch list at the end of every April and we've been on it every time,"" he said. ""We've been having discussions about copyright. We think it fully meets our trade obligations.""
He also repeated that Canada would not concede to U.S. demands to cap Canadian grain exports to the United States.

HeatherScoffield,"Officials from the world's biggest trading partners agreed Friday to push a deal on opening up financial services markets to the top of the agenda in talks to liberalise global trade.
The leaders also emphasised the importance of bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation as quickly as possible ""on commercially viable terms.""
The financial services talks are ""the most urgent, major priority in terms of negotiations for the world trade community,"" Leon Brittan, European Union Trade Commissioner, told a news conference after two days of talks between the so-called Quad partners -- Canada, Japan, the United States and the European Union.
""I believe that the Quad meeting has given a shot in the arm"" to negotiations on financial services, Brittan said.
The Quad members agreed to put forward requests by mid-June and offers no later than July 14 to work towards a financial services deal. They hope to wrap up negotiations in December.
""That should be an example to the rest of the world and a platform on which to build,"" Brittan said.
But he and the other leaders pointed out the need for countries in Asia and Latin America to put together improved offers to the World Trade Organisation. Last year the United States pulled out of talks on financial services because of its disappointment in the offers from other countries.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in a letter last week to a number of his counterparts, said a successful financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice.
It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial services providers, he said.
The four trading chiefs also called for bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation quickly.
The Quad members said they were united in their belief that China, in particular, should be brought into the global trading forum as long as Beijing committed itself to the global trading system and open market access.
""We are not going to push on the accelerator for political reasons, and we are not going to put on the brakes for political reasons,"" Brittan said.
Officials said the Quad members would like new members, especially China, to sign on to a recent pact to eliminate tariffs on various information technologies by 2000.
The forum provided an opportunity for the four countries to discuss bilateral trade issues with each other.
The European Union expressed concern about the implementation of a 1992 agreement with the United States limiting subsidies to aircraft industries.
""We do not accept that proposition at all, at the same time the United States has some concerns about European practices,"" U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after a morning meeting with Brittan.
Barshefsky said U.S. and EU officials would continue discussions on the issue in June, but that the United States would not agree to any emergency consultations.
Barshefsky also had a strong word with Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton over Canada's new copyright law which taxes blank cassettes and distributes the royalties to performers. U.S. performers, however, will not receive any money since the United States has not signed an international copyright agreement.
""We think there is a national treatment problem here,"" Barshefsky said, referring to one country's preferential treatment for its citizens. She said the United States would consider taking trade action against Canada over the law.
But Eggleton said Canada was well within its rights and obligations with the copyright law.
"
HeatherScoffield,"Canada's Federal Court ruled on Monday that immigration officials should move to deport a Saudi dissident suspected of being involved in a bombing that killed 19 U.S. airmen in Saudi Arabia last June.
Federal Court Judge Donna McGillis decided that a government certificate declaring Hani Abdel-Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh a terrorist and a danger to Canada was ""reasonable"" -- despite Sayegh's refusal to testify in the case.
""The court has satisfied itself that he was involved in terrorist activities,"" said Gaetan Blais, a spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
As a result, Sayegh will almost certainly be deported, although Canada's immigration minister must still decide whether he will be sent to the United States or Saudi Arabia. Sayegh cannot appeal the decision.
The Canadian government has accused Sayegh of being a driver involved in the massive truck bomb in Saudi Arabia last June 25 that killed 19 U.S. airmen. The bombing, which also injured 400 people, was at the Khobar Towers, a complex housing U.S. military personnel outside Dhahran in the oil-rich eastern part of Saudi Arabia.
The government also believes Sayegh is involved in the Saudi branch of Hizbollah, a fundamentalist group based in Lebanon, court documents showed. Canada believes Hizbollah is using Canada as a safe haven.
The hearing on Monday was meant to give Sayegh a chance to defend himself against the government charges. But Sayegh surprised the court by turning down a chance to testify.
""His testimony in this matter was crucial,"" McGillis said as she handed down her ruling.
Sayegh's lawyer, Doug Baum, would not say why his client did not give his side of the story.
""It's a difficult question to answer,"" Baum told reporters outside the courthouse. ""It's a deeply personal decision.""
Baum denied that his client had been advised by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
But he said Sayegh's silence was not an admission of guilt, since the hearing was an immigration case rather than a criminal case.
""There were no admissions or denials,"" Baum said. ""The issue today is not his chance to defend himself on the issue of guilt or innocence or punishment. The issue today was admissibility to Canada.""
He said his hands were tied in defending Sayegh since the court shared only the summary of the government's case with him.
""I think the evidence in the summary is not up to scratch,"" Baum said.
U.S. and Saudi officials have said they want to question Sayegh about his links to the bombing.
Sayegh, 28, was arrested in Ottawa on March 18 on the grounds that he posed a security threat to Canada. He arrived in the country applying for refugee status from Saudi Arabia because of what he said was poor treatment of Shi'ite Moslems by the Sunni Moslem government.
He has told reporters that he was in Syria at the time of the deadly bombing.
Canadian government documents said that of the known conspirators in the bombing, Jaafar Chueikhat was dead, supposedly after committing suicide in a Syrian prison, Ahmed Ibrahim Ahmad al-Mughassil had been identified as the mastermind and Sayegh conducted the surveillance and drove the car directing the truck that exploded, killing the U.S. airmen.

HeatherScoffield,"Canada's stubborn youth unemployment problem is the Achilles heel for the ruling Liberals as they campaign for re-election on June 2.
As Prime Minister Jean Chretien travels the country to boast about his party's economic record, a 16.6 percent youth unemployment rate threatens to be a serious embarrassment for the Liberals. The unemployment rate for the general population is 9.3 percent.
""This is the Liberal betrayal of an entire generation, their hopes, their dreams, and yes, their birth right as Canadians,"" the leader of the leftist New Democratic Party, Alexa McDonough, said on Tuesday.
""Somewhere along the line the Liberals decided that Canada could afford to lose a generation after all,"" McDonough told CBC Newsworld in Newfoundland.
The number of Canadian young people with jobs has dropped steeply in recent years, Canada's federal statistics agency said in a recent study.
The employment rate for Canadians aged 15 to 24 in 1996 was 51.1 percent, a drop of more than 11 percentage points since 1989, Statistics Canada said.
The most recent statistics show the employment rate for youth was 50.5 percent in March. The difference between the 50.5 percent employment rate and the 16.6 unemployment rate is made up of young people in school or who have given up finding a job.
""The labor market has become a more precarious place for young people in the 1990s,"" StatsCan said in its spring 1997 youth unemployment report.
But none of the parties have a concrete plan to deal with youth unemployment, despite their rampant rhetoric, said Brad Lavigne, chairman of the 400,000-member Cahadian Federation of Students.
""There hasn't been an adequate level of discussion yet,"" he said in a phone interview in Ottawa. ""The (age group) is not seen as important. It's very easy to dismiss it.""
The Liberals have a youth employment strategy which provides summer jobs and access to job information. They also give reductions in unemployment insurance premiums to small businesses that create new jobs.
""That's a more effective way than simply cutting the premium across the board,"" said Industry Minister John Manley during a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday.
The Conservatives, who hope to make a comeback in the election from their current two seats out of 295 in the House of Commons, say they have made youth employment a top priority.
Conservative Leader Jean Charest says his party wants to cut unemployment insurance contributions, establish common educational standards and testing to train young people for high-tech jobs and set up a C$50-million fund for common standards.
""The lack of federal leadership is causing our children to fall behind in the race for success in the new global economy,"" Charest said recently.
And the right-leaning Reform party, with strong roots in Western Canada, also wants to cut taxes as a way to create jobs for young people.
But none of the plans will make a dent in the unemployment problem, said the student federation's Lavigne.
He said the political parties and many Canadians have given up on the government's ability to do anything to create jobs.

HeatherScoffield,"Canada hopes Asia-Pacific trade ministers in Montreal for trade talks will forge a consensus to target environmental products and services as an area for trade liberalisation.
""Environmental goods and services and technologies is one (sector) that I particularly favour,"" Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said Thursday, the first day of a three-day meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
Analysts said Eggleton is under pressure to make sure the APEC trade ministers have something concrete to show at the end of their meeting, held to set the agenda for an APEC summit in Vancouver, British Columbia, in November.
Environmental technologies is an area where Canada should find it easy to gather support, said senior Canadian trade officials.
""It tends to get a rather positive echo around the circuit,"" said one official who asked not to be identified.
Last year, the 18 APEC members kick-started a worldwide agreement on liberalising the information technology market, Eggleton said, and he hopes APEC can play a similar role this year in at least one sector.
""There's a lot of pressure (to announce concrete progress),"" Karen Minden, director of the APEC Studies Foundation for Canada, said in a telephone interview. ""People in the organisation have said if APEC doesn't catch the leaders' attention, then it won't get anywhere.""
Canada is this year's chair for APEC, and wants to show the world in November that the huge forum, which includes some of the world's richest countries as well as many developing countries, can be productive.
Previous summits have been long on trade liberalisation rhetoric but slow to promote free trade measures, critics charge.
""This will be the meeting that gets things started,"" Eggleton told reporters. ""I expect what we're going to announce is that we're moving forward and developing an agenda for the November meeting that will help ensure we'll come out of this Canada Year for APEC with some very solid accomplishments.""
He said he also hopes the trade ministers will discuss implementing country-specific trade liberalisation action plans put together by each of the 18 members last year.
""If we come out of this meeting having named one or two sectors, then we will have done well,"" a senior trade official said.
While U.S. officials said earlier this week they hoped to use the APEC meeting to test the waters for tariff cuts on wood and paper products, Canadian officials were not optimistic progress would be made in that sector.
""There are some sensitivities here,"" said the official. He said Canada would love to eliminate all tariffs in wood and paper trade, but APEC was divided on the issue.
Officials said they also hoped to make progress on streamlining customs regulations, which often cost small and medium-sized businesses crucial time and money in international trade.
""For these people, (customs red tape is) not merely an inconvenience like it is for big business,"" an official said. ""It's a block.""
As the APEC trade ministers prepared for their first dinner together Thursday, Canadian labour leaders called on them to focus on human rights in Indonesia.
The labour leaders said they opposed the imprisonment of Muchtar Pakpahan, an Indonesian trade union leader and dissident. The Canadians cited a letter from U.S. President Clinton conveying his disapproval of Pakpahan's jailing, and they urged Canadian officials to follow suit.
Eggleton said he would discuss human rights with Indonesia if the two countries could arrange a bilateral meeting.
APEC aims to achieve free and open trade and investment in the region among developed countries by 2010 and among all member countries by 2020.
APEC's members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
"
HeatherScoffield,"Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton faces pressure at a meeting of Asia-Pacific officials that starts on Thursday to ensure concrete steps are taken to achieve free and open trade, analysts said.
Trade ministers from the 18 member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum are meeting through Saturday here to set the agenda for an APEC summit in Vancouver in November.
""There's a lot of pressure,"" said Karen Minden, director of the APEC Studies Foundation for Canada. ""People in the organisation have said if APEC doesn't catch the leaders' attention, then it won't get anywhere.""
Canada wants to show the world in November that the huge forum, which includes some of the world's richest countries and many developing countries, can be productive. Previous summits have been long on talk of reform but slow to promote free trade measures, critics say.
Canada, which as APEC chair this year will play a big role in directing the summit agenda, has a reputation for focusing on administration and structure rather than on trade reform.
But Eggleton probably will pick up on sectors discussed last week in Toronto at a conference of trade ministers from the United States, Japan, the European Union and Canada.
The so-called Quad countries agreed to make liberalisation of financial services a priority, with Canada optimistic about progress on trade in environmental products.
But APEC members should expect resistance from lesser developed Asian countries on financial services, said a Canadian trade specialist who asked not to be identified.
At the top of everyone's minds will likely be China's bid to join the World Trade Organisation, the trade expert said.
""The biggest issue will be in my view the WTO accession of China,"" the expert said in a phone interview.
At last week's Quad meeting, trade ministers said they wanted to bring China and Russia into the WTO quickly but wanted to assure Beijing was committed to the global trading system and open access to markets.
The APEC meeting will also provide an opportunity to test the waters for a new round of tariff cuts on wood, paper and other products, U.S. officials said.
APEC aims to achieve free and open trade and investment in the region between developed countries by 2010 and between all member countries by 2020.
APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

HeatherScoffield,"Trade ministers from 18 Asia- Pacific countries were urged to support renewed talks for free and open trade in financial services, official documents showed on Friday.
In the documents, senior officials requested that ministers at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Montreal ""note the successful re-launch of the financial services negotiations.""  
The officials said that ""while recognizing that flexibility may be needed with regard to transition periods for some participants, (we) urge all APEC participants in these negotiations to strive toward achieveing a permanent, most favored nation-based agreement by December 1997.""
Trade ministers from Canada, the United States, the European Union and Japan announced in Toronto last week that they would push negotiations in financial services to the top of the agenda for world trade liberalization talks.
Talks broke down last year after the United States pulled out because of its disappointment in the offers from other countries.
At the Toronto meeting last week, the so-called Quad leaders urged Asia and Latin America to improve their offers to the World Trade Organization. APEC's support this week will likely be seen as a big boost for the talks.
APEC leaders were also urged to consider expanding an agreement liberalizing trade in information technologies forged last December.
APEC members should ""consider the planned review of the Information Technologies Agreement with a view to the possibility of broadening participation in the agreement to all APEC members,"" the document said.
The United States and the European Union have said they hoped China, in particular, would join the agreement as a major step toward China's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
In the document, senior officials also asked the trade ministers to complete the implementation of the recent agreement to open telecommunications markets by January 1, 1998.
APEC includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
"
HeatherScoffield,"Trade ministers from the Asia Pacific region agreed on Saturday to work toward free trade in financial services and expanding open markets for information technology.
The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum wrapped up its three-day trade ministers' meeting in Montreal, agreeing to look for ways to expand last year's information technology deal to include more products and more countries.
In the information technology sector, ""there are a number of both non-tariff measures and tariff measures that we might take up and we're hopeful that we'll see significant progress later this year,"" deputy U.S. trade representative Jeff Lang told a news conference. But Lang would not supply details on the kind of progress he hoped to see.
The information technology agreement included 41 countries and 91 percent of world trade now, but Lang said four or five more countries were interested.
The ministers also announced they were committed to forging a final financial services deal by December.
""Clearly what I'm hearing from the 18 members of APEC is that they want it to work this time,"" Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said after the final news conference. Eggleton chaired the three-day meeting since Canada will host the APEC summit scheduled for Vancouver in November.
Previous talks on an international agreement on financial services fell through last year after the United States pulled out because of its disappointment in offers from some other countries.
And U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned on Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers.
""The United States will put forward an MFN (most favored nation) consistent offer, but it will be conditional on achieving a critical mass in the Asian countries and Latin America,"" she told reporters.
Among the 18 APEC members, some of them will have progressive offers in time for the WTO deadline of mid-July, Barshefsky said.
""There are others who have shown reluctance. The same with Latin America,"" she said. ""These offers are going to have to be good, or the United States will seek an MFN exemption.""
Such an exemption would likely stall progress on the talks.
Last month, the United States said a financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice. It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial service providers, the United States said.
Chile's Trade Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said his country would do its best to make a good financial services offer.
""We are prepared to make our offer and try to improve it, if it's possible,"" Insulza told a news conference.
The world's major trading powers have agreed to put forward requests on financial services commerce by mid-June and offers by July 14 in the hopes of finalizing a deal by the end of December.
The United States and Canada emphasized the role APEC should take in isolating certain trade sectors, liberalizing them within APEC and then putting them on to the agenda at the World Trade Organization. APEC agreements are voluntary, while WTO deals are binding.
But the lesser developed countries that form a large part of APEC's membership appeared to place sectoral liberalization on a lower pedestal than the developed countries. Instead, they emphasized unilateral and voluntary plans to knock down trade barriers.
""I think we have to emphasize that the system talks about individual action plans as well as sectoral liberalization,"" said Cesar Bautista, the trade minister for the Phillipines.
Malaysia and Indonesia both stressed the need to help small and medium sized businesses develop trading strategies. They said they appreciated APEC's progress on cutting customs red tape and promoting international investment in infrastructure.
"
HeatherScoffield,"Countries belonging to the World Trade Organization should be flexible and understanding about China's bid to join the WTO, the organization's director-general said on Saturday.
""As we approach the final stage of the Chinese accession process, there is a need for flexibility on all sides and a determination to resolve the crucial outstanding issues in the negotiations,"" Renato Ruggiero told trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
""The success of this negotiation is a shared responsibility, and it can be assured only if we keep up the momentum established earlier this year,"" Ruggiero said.
He said substantial progress is needed on rules issues and market access.
The APEC members said they wanted China and Russia to join the WTO quickly, as long as they join on commercially viable terms, officials said.
The world's major trading partners have suggested that China join last year's international agreement to open up trade in information technology before it acceeds to the 130-member World Trade Organization.
Ruggiero said that talks on financial services have become the WTO's top priority.
""A success in financial services is essential to help ensure each of you -- industrialized and developing countries alike -- the necessary infrastructure growth,"" Ruggiero told the Asia-Pacific trade ministers.
""My message is: do not see this negotiation in North/South terms,"" he continued. ""On the contrary, developing countries whatever their economic position, have an even stronger need than the industrial countries for competitive financial institutions.""
Ruggiero urged APEC to make sure a financial services deal is reached this year, to maintain momentum in international trade talks.
""Not to  do so should be as unthinkable as it would be short-sighted,"" Ruggiero said.
Last week, the United States, the European Union, Canada and Japan affirmed they would stick to the WTO schedule on financial services by putting forward their offers by mid-July.
On Saturday, the 18 APEC countries affirmed their support too, building strong momentum for a deal by the end of the year in the lucrative sector, officials said.
But U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers. The United States pulled out of previous attempts to broker free trade in financial services because of its disappointment in offers from other countries.
The meeting between the WTO leader and the APEC trade ministers confirmed APEC's role as a regional catalyst for action within the WTO, trade officials said.
But Hong Kong expressed its concern about the WTO's dumping code, while Korea and Japan said they were worried about an onslaught of agriculture products flooding their markets from lesser developed countries because of WTO regulations, officials said.
"
HeatherScoffield,"The United States wants Asia-Pacific countries to expand free trade in information technology, telecommunications and financial services so that the region can influence the World Trade Organization agenda, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said on Saturday.
""APEC has decided that it should play the catalytic role in sector opening,"" Barshefsky told reporters on the final day of a three-day meeting of trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
""This is terribly significant,"" she said. ""APEC ought to be leading the way.""
Barshefsky said APEC will take the lead in expanding last year's agreement to liberalize information technologies markets and a recent deal to open up trade in telecommunications. If they succeed, APEC countries should give the impetus for a worldwide agreement to liberalize financial services markets.
""APEC countries will give a very strong push,"" she said.
If enough APEC members voluntarily agree to liberalize trade in these sectors, the organization can push the World Trade Organization to make the APEC deal binding on the larger trade body, Barshefsky said. Agreement is easier to reach within APEC than the WTO since the group is smaller and the agreements are not binding, she added.
But progress on financial services depends largely on Latin American and Asian countries significantly beefing up their offers, Barshefsky said.
""The United States will put forward an MFN (most favored nation)-consistent offer, but it will be conditional on achieving a critical mass in the Asian countries and Latin America,"" she said.
Among the 18 APEC members, some of them will have progressive offers in time for the WTO deadline of mid-July, Barshefsky said.
""There are others who have shown reluctance. The same with Latin America,"" she said.
""These offers are going to have to be good, or the United States will seek an MFN exemption,"" she challenged.
Such an exemption would likely stall progress on the talks. Last month, the United States said a financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice. It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial service providers, the United States said.
The world's major trading powers have agreed to put forward requests on financial services commerce by mid-June and offers by July 14 in the hopes of finalizing a deal by the end of December.
Barshefsky said APEC, which concentrates on developing voluntary initiatives on free trade, should focus on forming sectoral free-trade pacts for areas that are important enough to force the rest of the world to join in.
She said she wants to have more than one sector to announce by the APEC summit in Vancouver in November.
Other APEC countries have suggested singling out trade in environmental services, medical products, oil seeds, wood, paper, chemicals and autos.
APEC includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
"
HeatherScoffield,"Trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific region were urged on Friday to cut customs red tape and make it easier to finance Asia's huge infrastructure needs, officials at the APEC trade ministers' meeting said.
But an Australian proposal to develop a travelling ""smart card"" to let business officials from Asia-Pacific countries jump to the front of the line when clearing customs got short shrift from Canada, the conference's host.
""We are looking at a slightly different approach,"" a senior Canadian trade official said. ""Our approach is to try to work on a larger package.""
Australia's proposal dealt with business travelers but not their cargo, the official said. The Philippines, Hong Kong and South Korea back Australia's plan for now, he added.
The APEC travelling card was one of several recommendations put forward by international business representatives at the first full session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum for trade ministers.
""We are the reality test and ... we are very happy about the dialogue that we started today,"" said Victor Fung, co-chairman of the APEC business advisory council, an international group of trade-oriented business representatives that has considerable influence on the APEC agenda.
Officials said Canada also used the session to drum up support to make it easier to finance Asia's massive infrastructure requirements. The region will require about $1.5 trillion to build transportation and communication links over the next 10 years, officials said.
Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton urged his counterparts to make information about private sector investment more readily available and to develop a framework that dealt with foreign financing of infrastructure projects.
""It's a very preliminary interest right now, but (Eggleton) did flag the special interest Canada has,"" an official said.
Officials said they expected substantial progress on harmonising customs regulations at the three-day meeting in Montreal. Canadian officials said they hoped to be able to post harmonised customs forms on the Internet that would let international traders file electronically around the world.
""They really want to move toward a much firmer, clearer blueprint, which will explain to businesses what it is they have to do,"" an official said.
Canada, as host of the meeting and of the APEC summit scheduled for Vancouver in November, has focused mainly on helping small and medium-sized companies clear hurdles to expand international trade. Simpler customs procedures and travelling requirements would be a big boost for the smaller companies, officials said.
The business community, especially smaller firms, would benefit greatly from financial guidelines for infrastructure, said Fung of the business advisory council.
He said the council would recommend in Vancouver that APEC set up a network to tie together organisations dealing with small and medium-sized enterprises in each country.
The APEC ministers are scheduled to take up broader trade issues on Saturday, during a meeting with World Trade Organisation officials and WTO Chairman Renato Ruggiero.
In a conference document, senior officials requested that the ministers recognise the ""successful re-launch of the financial services negotiations and, while recognising that flexibility may be needed ... urge all APEC participants in these negotiations to strive toward achieving a permanent Most Favoured Nation-based agreement by December 1997.""
The document also urged ministers to consider the WTO's planned review of an agreement for open markets in information technology, and consider broadening participation in the agreement to all members.
APEC includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. REUTER

HeatherScoffield,"Canada's election campaign shifted into high gear on Tuesday as party leaders prepared for the French-language debate after a relentless attack on Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien in Monday's English debate.
The troubling issue of Quebec independence will be in the forefront of Tuesday night's French debate among the leaders of the five major parties, ahead of the June 2 election.
""When it gets into (national) unity, there's an emotional attachment there that has to be responded to,"" Reform Party leader Preston Manning said on Tuesday. ""I believe it is emerging as one of the defining issues.""
Manning scored points in the English debate when he attacked Chretien for bringing Canada to the brink of separation.
Quebeckers narrowly voted to keep their French-speaking province in Canada in Quebec's 1995 sovereignty referendum, by 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent, despite assurances by Chretien that a solid vote against separation was virtually assured.
""You almost blew it, sir,"" Manning told Chretien. ""You do not deserve a second chance.""
But Manning faces a challenge as he tries to get his national unity message across in the French debate. Since he speaks only English, his participation will be limited to addresses at the beginning and the end of the debate.
The pressure is also on Gilles Duceppe, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, who must shine during the French debate after a low-key performance in the English debate.
The Bloc became Canada's main opposition party in the last election in 1993, despite its aim to partition the country.
But the Bloc's grip on Quebec is threatened by early campaign gaffes and a new controversy over whether Quebec's separatist government would have unilaterally declared independence if it had won the 1995 referendum.
Duceppe, Chretien and Conservative leader Jean Charest -- all Quebeckers -- were expected to dominate the French debate. Alexa McDonough, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party will also participate.
Charest stirred the English studio audience to applause on Monday when he proclaimed: ""I intend to make this country work, because if there's one commitment I made to my children, it's that I'm going to pass on to them the country I received from my parents.""
He said on Tuesday that he expected to be the main target during the French debate.
""Tonight I think you'll see them very aggressive with regards to my own participation,"" he told a morning news conference.
The Liberals have a huge lead in opinion polls, with the backing of between 42 and 47 percent of decided voters.
"
HeatherScoffield,"Canada's French-language televised debate for the June 2 federal election was cut short suddenly on Tuesday when the moderator collapsed, leaving the five political party leaders stunned.
Moderator Claire Lamarche, a television personality in French-speaking Quebec, fell out of her chair moaning about the heat in the room just as the five political party leaders were about to attack the key election issue of national unity.
""We decided together that the debate should not continue under the circumstances,"" Arnold Amber, one of organizers of the debate, said in a hastily arranged news conference. ""All the parties are in agreement with this.""
The party leaders left without speaking to the media.
Canadians had expected a lively debate on how to handle the troubling issue of Quebec independence. But the moderator's collapse made the abbreviated exchange anti-climactic, said political scientist Ken McRoberts at York University in Toronto.
""There might have been some dramatic moments in the exchange over the response to a (pro-sovereignty vote),"" McRoberts said in a phone interview from Toronto. ""So (separatist Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles) Duceppe must be quite frustrated.""
Duceppe, a francophone, was sidelined in the English debate on Monday night but observers expected him to use the French-language debate to rally the separatist forces and gather support for his waning campaign.
The debate was about two hours into its scheduled 2-1/2 hours when the moderator collapsed, just as Prime Minister Jean Chretien was asked if he would recognize a vote in favor of Quebec sovereignty if it were by a slim margin.
In 1995, people in French-speaking Quebec voted 50.6 percent against Quebec separation, while 49.4 percent voted in favor of separation, prompting federalist forces to claim victory.
But instead of exploring how the next government would handle an expected referendum on sovereignty next year, the debate focused on Canada's high unemployment rate, robbing Duceppe of the chance to stir up much nationalist spirit.
""You decreased the deficit on the backs of the poor,"" Duceppe accused the prime minister.
But Chretien, much feistier in the French debate than in Monday night's English debate, fended off his competitors time and again, speaking about his party's economic record.
Unemployment, especially among young Canadians ""is a very serious problem,"" Chretien said. ""However, first you have to have an economy which creates jobs, and this is the reason why we have to get rid of the deficit.""
Under Chretien's Liberals, the budget deficit has been cut back from about C$42 billion (US$30.3 billion) in 1993 to a projected 1996 defecit of C$16 billion (US$11.5 billion). But Canada's unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly between nine and 10 percent for much of Liberals' term.
Chretien, Duceppe and Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest -- the three francophone leaders -- spent much of the evening trying to show their parties had Quebec's best interests at heart.
The two anglophone leaders -- Preston Manning, the leader of the right-wing Reform Party, and Alexa McDonough, who heads the left-leaning New Democratic Party -- were marginalized by their poor French.
Over the two days of debates, Charest appears to have fared better than the other leaders. ""My sense is that Charest shone, as he did (Monday) night,"" McRoberts said. ""He is very articulate and very well prepared.""
Charest's leadership has already translated into a surge in his popularity in Quebec. A recent poll indicated he was the most popular of federal party leaders in Quebec.
The Progressive Conservatives have a long way to go, however. They currently hold only two of 295 seats in the House of Commons after being decimated in the last federal election.
The Liberals have a huge lead in opinion polls, with the backing of between 42 and 47 percent of decided voters.

HeatherScoffield,"Canada supports the U.S. bid to speed up free trade talks among 34 countries in North and South America, a Canadian foreign affairs spokesman said on Friday.
""We're certainly pushing for an early start to negotiations as well,"" spokesman Charles Larabie said in a telephone interview.
Ministers from the 34 countries were meeting in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte this week to decide when to start formal negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas. But the meeting faced a north-south divide on how to pace the talks.
Brazil and its supporters want to proceed cautiously, negotiating in stages with tariff cuts until last.
But the United States is pushing for more concrete decisions and a faster pace in talks, threatening on Friday to ""pack its bags"" if it did not get its way.
The group aims to achieve a free trade deal by 2005.
While Canada would like to see faster progress, ""I wouldn't say we're ready to pack up our bags,"" Larabie said.
Canada also has a backup plan if formal negotiations for the FTAA do not go as fast as hoped.
Canada would push to join the South American free trade bloc Mercosur, which precluded the United States, Larabie said.
Mercosur is a free trade pact involving Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Chile and Bolivia are associate members.
""For us there's a tremendous market there,"" said Larabie.
Canada sees two major impediments to formalising free trade talks to form the FTAA. First, President Bill Clinton does not have so-called fast-track authority to negotiate free trade deals. Second, Brazil and its supporters wanted to take their time negotiating the FTAA, said Larabie.
So while the United States struggled to push the FTAA agenda, Canada was busy preparing the groundwork for a Mercosur deal that would preclude the Americans and give Canadians ""a foot in the door"" with South America, Larabie said.
As for the United States, ""they can join the party later,"" he added.
""Cleary Brazil stands out as the major opportunity for us in Mercosur,"" he said.""Argentina is also attractive for us.""
Trade between Brazil and Canada was worth about C$2.5 billion ($1.79 billion) in 1996, almost double that of 1993.
A Canadian deal with Mercosur would not be the first time Canada moved ahead without the United States, as Clinton awaited fast-track authority.
Canada has negotiated a free trade deal with Chile rather than waiting for the United States to agree to let Chile enter the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"
HeatherScoffield,"Canada's political leaders, campaigning for re-election on June 2, are accusing one another of being too American in their approach to Canada's cherished but malnourished health care system.
Canada's universal medicare plan has suffered injury after injury in recent years as governments at the federal and provincial levels have taken a hatchet to health care spending in an effort to rein in galloping deficits.
While all Canada's main political parties are pledging to reinvest in health if successful on June 2, the sensitive issue has become a political game of numbers and name calling.
The ruling Liberals as well as the Conservative and Reform parties want to cut health care and are ""pushing Canada ever closer to an American-style two-tiered system,"" Alexa McDonough, leader of the left-leaning New Democrats, charged.
""Look past the rhetoric and look at the numbers,"" she said, adding that only her party would sustain federal support for medicare.
Government-funded universal health care is a sacred cow in Canada and a key way for Canadians to distinguish themselves from their powerful American neighbours. Polls show that preservation of health care is a major election concern.
But even as U.S. politicians have weighed adopting elements of Canadian health care in the past few years, Canada has moved further away from its traditional universal approach, adopting elements of the U.S. setup, the New Democrats say.
The Liberals have cut health and education spending to C$12.5 billion ($9.1 billion), down about C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) from 1993, when they first took office under Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
Critics say the cuts have shortened hospital stays, led to hospital closures and forced many Canadians to pay for their own home care -- shifting the system toward a U.S.-style one in which only the poor and the elderly receive care paid for by the government.
But the Liberals claim to have defended the principles of universal medicare by preventing doctors and hospitals from charging extra for their services and prohibiting private health care clinics.
""All Canadians should have equal access to high-quality care,"" Anne McLellan, a Liberal candidate and Cabinet minister, said on Tuesday at a news conference. ""We will never accept one system for the very wealthy and another for the rest of us.""
The day after Chretien called the June election, his government announced it would reverse C$4.8 billion ($3.5 billion) in planned cuts in transfers to the provinces for health and social spending over the next five years.

HeatherScoffield,"Hundreds of mining prospectors, armed with axes and machetes, are racing through swamps and thick brush in remote Northern Ontario this week in one of the largest staking rushes in decades.
The Ontario government invited prospectors to explore a 617,500-hectare area in the Temagami region, making the land available for the first time in 23 years.
But there was a shortage of experienced prospectors in the area, so big companies trained local high school track teams to fill in.
""There's a lot of potential,"" provincial government geologist Elaine Basa said. ""It's an area that hasn't been open to new technology. It's like virgin territory and that's what's exciting to a lot of people.""
Up to 600 prospectors, many of them hired by international mining companies, have been clambering across the rugged Canadian Shield, hoping to find gold or base metals.
The parcel of land is not far from existing gold mines and old copper and base metal mines, Basa said.
""That's why it's such a big target,"" she said. ""A lot of people want a piece of the pie.""
The Ontario government closed off the area in 1973 after a local Indian band laid claim to the land. The claim was struck down in 1991 and the government eventually decided to open the area to logging and exploration again -- despite raucous protests from environmentalists.
Major international mining companies, small explorers and independent prospectors have flocked to the rocky Canadian Shield. Most spent the weekend camping in the bush, preparing for what many saw as the chance of a lifetime.
Prospectors must follow strict rules to stake their claims.
""You physically have to define the boundaries out in the field,"" said Roy Denomme, a government mining recorder.
The race started Tuesday morning, with prospectors sprinting through the thick bush to pound a huge stake in each corner of the property. Between each stake, they had to blaze a boundary by marking trees with their axes along the way.
Some prospectors spent the weekend hiding stakes in the thick forest near the claim corners, hoping to get an edge on their competitors, said Basa.
The first person to stake all four corners and file a claim wins the rights to the property. Prospectors have 31 days to file their claims.
Basa expects a lot of wheeling and dealing in the next few days as the powerful mining companies manoeuvre for the best properties.
Toronto-based Falconbridge Ltd. sent a team of prospectors to the area in helicopters.
""It's a real crap shoot,"" said Paul Severin, vice president of exploration for Falconbridge, whose huge copper-zinc Kidd Creek mine is in nearby Timmins, Ontario.

HeatherScoffield,"Canada's French-speaking political leaders voiced anger on Friday about a new pre-election ad that suggested Quebec-born politicians did not have what it takes to keep Quebec from leaving Canada.
""The suggestion that where you are born should determine whether or not you should be prime minister of the country is to say the least offensive,"" a sombre Jean Charest, leader of the Conservative Party, told reporters in Ottawa.
The ad, promoting the right-wing Reform Party, shows three French-speaking Canadian party leaders -- including Canadian Prime Minister and Liberal leader Jean Chretien -- along with Quebec Premier and leading separatist Lucien Bouchard.
As the ad calls for ""a voice for all Canadians, not just Quebec politicians,"" the images of the four Quebeckers are circled in red and then each face is crossed out.
Canada has had Quebec prime ministers for 19 of the last 20 years -- Quebec has a crucial one-quarter of the population -- and Chretien led Canada in an October 1995 referendum that Quebec sovereigntists lost by only one point.
Three of the five political leaders contesting the June 2 election are from Quebec: Charest, Chretien and the leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe.
Aside from Reform's Preston Manning, from the West, the New Democratic Party's Alexa McDonough is the only non-Quebecker to lead a major political party in this campaign.
""Mr. Manning is setting a very bad example,"" the normally upbeat Charest said, looking troubled. ""He's sending a message here that one part of the country doesn't count.""
Chretien declared in Niagara Falls: ""I want to tell Mr. Manning that people don't like his divisiveness.""
Manning, who advocates decentralization to please both Quebec and other provinces, contends the traditional parties have failed to devise a method to keep Canada together.
""The separatists do damage by what they do. The old-line federalists do damage by what they do not do, the plan that they do not have, the alternative model they do not have, the strategies they do not have for the next referendum.
""We're saying each is equally dangerous in its own way to the unity of the country.""
But Manning -- running second in the polls outside Quebec -- has no voter base in Quebec and a poll released on Friday showed the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois neck-and-neck in the vote-rich French-speaking province.
It was not clear how his strategy would play across the country, but as often before in this 36-day campaign, he managed to get other politicians talking about his issues.
""It can divide the country. What he is doing I think is an act of desperation,"" said one Liberal voter, retired engineer Bal Sandhu of from the western city of Edmonton, Alberta.
But many voters are sick of the Quebec issue coming up again and again and think Quebec manages to get a disproportionate share of Ottawa's attention.
""They get more opportunities than the rest of the country, because the government is bending over backwards to try and keep them in the confederation,"" a disenchanted Edmonton technologist, John Mushka, said in a phone interview.
Charest has been rising steadily in popularity since televised leadership debates last week which put national unity at the center of the election campaign.
He is on an intense two-day tour of Quebec to build momentum, with a keen eye on forming the official opposition. The Bloc Quebecois fills that role, giving Canada an official opposition whose goal is to break up the country.
The Reform Party, with its strong support in Western Canada, also has hopes of forming the official opposition.
The stakes are high for Charest, who is personally popular but whose party suffers from a turbulent past. The Tories fell to only two seats in the 1993 election after controlling the government for eight years. And former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is reviled across Canada.

JaneMacartney,"China appealed for calm while South Korea called for a military alert amid fears a diplomatic deadlock over a senior Pyongyang defector marooned in Beijing could push the hermit North to take extreme action.
However, signs emerged that North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-il might be ready to give up the fight to recover scholarly ideologue Hwang Jang-yop -- possibly as a result of mediation by Beijing to end the Cold War crisis in its backyard.
South Korean officials said talks continued with Beijing over the fate of Hwang, ranked 24th in Pyongyang's hierarchy, who spent his seventh day behind the white walls of Seoul's consulate office in Beijing.
Hwang could be the first in a stream of high-level defectors to betray their Stalinist homeland, beset by two years of floods, food shortages and talk of power struggles, South Korean media reported in Seoul.
South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung called for ""extraordinary alertness"" and military readiness against North Korea, saying Hwang's defection had sent shock waves through the divided Korean peninsula.
A Seoul newspaper said it had documents revealing plans by other North Korean officials to flee.
""The defection of secretary Hwang Jang-yop, who belongs to the core force of the North Korean leadership, vividly displays the shaking of the ideological foundation that has supported the North Korean system amid economic disasters,"" Lee said.
Seoul would spare no diplomatic efforts to allow Hwang to be granted political asylum, he said.
Lee told parliament that Pyongyang had increasingly deployed offensive forces near the border with the South, despite an economic crisis and chronic food shortages.
A military spokesman said Lee was referring to the North's defence build-up in recent years and no additional troops had been deployed at the tense border in the past week.
But China took no chances and sent three armoured personnel carriers to reinforce approaches to Seoul's mission, apparently not reassured by signs Pyongyang could be coming to terms with the loss of one of its greatest ideological thinkers.
The softer tone set when Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said it would dismiss Hwang if he defected was echoed by supreme leader Kim, who said those who lacked the grit to defend Pyongyang's fiery brand of communism should go their own way.
""As the revolutionary song goes: Cowards, Leave If You Want To! We will defend the red flag to the bitter end,"" a political essay broadcast by state radio quoted Kim as saying.
Pyongyang officials had previously been steadfast in their accusation that Seoul abducted the architect of North Korea's governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance. South Korea has dismissed the charge as preposterous.
North Korea's ambassador met Chinese Foreign Ministry officials in talks that apparently resulted in Pyongyang's change in tune and withdrawal of diplomats from a vigil outside the mission where Hwang is marooned, Western diplomats said.
Beijing, an unwilling third party in the feuding between the two hostile sides in the last Cold War standoff, repeated its plea to both to act with restraint to resolve the affair.
The United States has urged Pyongyang to avoid all provocative actions and has said it was closely monitoring developments after an assassination attempt against a former North Korean defector near Seoul on Saturday night.
The tussle over Hwang's defection was the latest flare-up in tense relations between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 Korean civil war ended only in a truce.
"
JaneMacartney,"South Korea on Tuesday urged ""extraordinary alertness"" against the rival North, warning that the defection of a senior North Korean official now marooned in Seoul's Beijing embassy showed the hermit state was unstable.
As China reinforced security at the South Korean mission, there was little sign of progress in the diplomatic deadlock with the two rival Koreas on what to do with Hwang Jang-yop, the most senior North Korean to betray his Stalinist homeland.
It was Hwang's seventh day in Seoul's consulate office.
Appeals for calm from China, an unwilling third party in the latest Cold War crisis, appeared to yield fruit with North Korea showing signs of backing off from its hard line over its highest ever defector.
But South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung called for ""extraordinary alertness"" against the North.
""The defection of secretary Hwang Jang-yop, who belongs to the core force of the North Korean leadership, vividly displays the shaking of the ideological foundation that has supported the North Korean system amid economic disasters,"" he said.
Hwang, one of 11 powerful secretaries of the ruling Workers' Party along with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, sought refuge at Seoul's mission in the Chinese capital last Wednesday.
Lee told parliament the communist North had increasingly deployed offensive forces near the border with the South, despite an economic crisis and chronic food shortage at home.
While repeating its appeals for calm, China was prepared for disturbances.
Police guarding the mission where Hwang is stranded went on higher alert, and three armoured personnel carriers filled with helmeted paramilitary police rumbled into the sedate diplomatic quarter to back up squads of police armed with assault rifles.
""We hope all parties can deal with this matter calmly... and calmly face and appropriately handle this incident to maintain peace and stability in the Korean peninsula,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Seoul and Beijing were working to find a solution to the three-way diplomatic crisis that has thrown relations among China and the two Koreas into turmoil, Seoul officials said.
""Negotiations with the Chinese government are still going on,"" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, but declined to give details.
He dismissed reports that three-way talks between Beijing, its old communist ally Pyongyang and its new capitalist friend Seoul were under way to break the deadlock over Hwang's fate.
The North has hinted it may accept Hwang's defection, saying it would dismiss him if he sought asylum.
""It is certain North Korea is changing its attitude,"" said Kim Kyung-woong, a senior official of Seoul's state South-North Dialogue Office.
North Korea's Foreign Ministry said late on Monday it would fire Hwang if he sought asylum in Seoul but warned of ""decisive countermeasures"" if it were proved he had been kidnapped.
North Korea had earlier maintained Seoul kidnapped Hwang, architect of the Stalinist nation's governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance. Seoul called the charge preposterous.
The tussle over Hwang's defection was the latest flare-up in tense relations between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 Korean civil war ended only in a truce.
The United States has urged Pyongyang to avoid all provocative actions and has said it was closely monitoring developments after an assassination attempt against a former North Korean defector near Seoul on Saturday night.
South Korea accused Pyongyang agents of shooting 32-year-old Li Il-nam in an attack that left him critically ill with a bullet still lodged in his skull. Doctors in Seoul said he was on life support and unlikely to regain consciousness.
"
JaneMacartney,"China was silent on Tuesday on the fragile health of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping after Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and other leaders cut short out-of-town trips to visit the ailing patriarch.
The State Council, or cabinet, declined on Tuesday to make immediate comment on the rumours that the health of Deng, 92, had deteriorated recently or that he had suffered a stroke.
In Taipei, Taiwan's top policymaker on mainland affairs described Deng's condition as serious and said the government would closely watch developments.
Party chief Jiang, who is also state president and head of the army, returned at the weekend, cutting short an unpublicised visit to the communist revolutionary base of Ganzhou in central Jiangxi province, said one Chinese source close to the party.
Premier Li Peng also flew back to Beijing at the weekend, abruptly curtailing a tour of the booming southern province of Guangdong because of Deng's deteriorating health, said the source, who asked not to be identified.
The two leaders had returned to Beijing where they visited Deng, the source said.
Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded compound behind the Forbidden City of China's emperors in central Beijing.
Diplomats have said one barometer of Deng's health in China's highly-secretive system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few willing to be out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death.
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing was abroad on a visit to Israel and Iran, and Defence Minister Chi Haotian was in the Philippines, where officials said he would not change his travel plans.
Chinese sources have reported increasing rumours in Beijing in the past few days that Deng's health may be failing.
However, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week Deng was all right for a man of his age.
Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of China's sweeping economic reforms had been rushed to hospital on Thursday after a massive stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke.
Doctors said that if Deng's stroke had been a haemorrhage he could have died within hours, while if it was a thrombosis, or formation of a blood clot, he could last days or weeks.
Rumours about Deng's health surface periodically and one such rumour caused Hong Kong stocks to tumble last Friday.
The worries over Deng's health deflated Taiwan's main stock index by 1.161 percent to 7563.76 on Tuesday morning while Hong Kong's major index slipped 0.80 percent to 13039.03.
Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he appeared frail and faltering on a visit to Shanghai. He is now believed to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity.
China's elderly leaders exert great influence after their retirement in a society where age is revered and in a communist system in which officials spend years building up a power base.
Deng retired from his last official position in 1990 and his only post is honorary chairman of China's Bridge Association, a title that reflects his passion for the card game.
Deng was in the public eye at the start of the new year when state television ran a 12-part documentary on his life, but without details of his present circumstances or interviews with his wife or children.
Western diplomats say the longer Deng lingers the less impact his death will have on the delicate balance of power at the top of China's ruling Communist Party.
"
JaneMacartney,"When Deng Xiaoping took power in 1979 an urban Chinese needed a year's salary to buy a black and white television.
When he died 18 years later, the average city dweller could afford a refrigerator, a washing machine and a colour television -- some could even buy their own home.
Deng took over a China wracked by the 1966-76 decade of the radical Cultural Revolution and an economy stultified by three decades of Stalinist central planning.
""Let some people get rich first,"" Deng said in an axiom that underlined his rapid-fire approach to the economic reform that marked his rule.
The goal of Deng's economic reforms, which he first tried and failed to implement in 1960s, reflected his more pragmatic policies after Mao's sweeping idealism.
Both men wanted to keep the Communist Party in power but Deng believed that economic prosperity and money in the pockets of every Chinese would be a safer guarantee.
""Without a vision of his own to impose on society, Deng has been willing to adopt policies of non-intervention,"" wrote Barry Naughton in ""Deng Xiaoping: The Portrait of a Chinese Statesman"".
He dared to sweep away rigid planning in favour of free market forces, allowed private business into the command economy and decided to open China's door to the rest of the world.
In so doing, he saw the average per capita income of urban Chinese soar by 1,500 percent to about 5,600 ($674) in 1995 from 316 yuan ($38) a year in 1978. Earnings of rural residents leapt by more than 2,500 percent to 3,600 yuan ($433) a year in 1996 compared with just 116 yuan ($13) in 1978.
On the world stage, its foreign trade has ballooned from an asterisk when Mao died in 1976 to 11th in the world and an engine of Asian growth in 1997.
Deng's first attempt at reform from 1976 to 1978 was also the first in a series of boom-bust cycles, a recurrent fact of economic reform for years. The economy overheated and had to be reined in as Deng rushed to allow Chinese to get rich.
But the tone was set. Deng and his day-to-day policy-makers wanted to revive the economy and they chose to do so by getting rid of over-bureacratisation and allowing greater autonomy.
They started by introducing the responsibility system for farmers, under which China's 800 million peasants were allowed to sell on the free market any produce they grew over and above the quota for which they were ""responsible"" to the state.
Agricultural output skyrocketed, farmers' incomes soared and rural enterprise was born.
That success prompted Deng to introduce the ""factory manager responsibility system"" that freed managers from the control of the Communist Party secretary ubiquitous in every state unit.
""Whoever is given responsibility should be given authority as well,"" Deng said in 1978.
He battled orthodox Marxist ideologues to legalise private enterprise.
He set up experimental Special Economic Zones on the coast where foreign investment and capitalist practices were allowed to flourish -- and then to seep into the rest of China.
He lifted decades of controls on prices of many items, a move that brought bursts of fierce inflation but also allowed the marketplace to take command and meant that goods filled shop shelves that had been left empty by decades of state planning.
The ultimate goal was to force enterprises to take responsibility for their own profits and losses and sink or swim amid market competition.
Many factories -- some state-owned, many collective and private -- responded to that challenge.
However, many government enterprises have been unable to compete, forcing the state to maintain subsidies to lumbering loss-making national industries for fear mass unemployment could trigger civil unrest to destabilise Deng's fragile new system.
About 70 percent of China's 100,000 state-owned enterprises operate in the red and state banks are burdened with enormous bad debts -- up to 30 percent of their portfolios -- because they must extend policy loans on orders from the government.
Deng's economic policymakers have tinkered with the spectre of bankruptcy but have repeatedly pulled back from the brink of a solution that raises shades of capitalism.
The existence of a quasi-private economy alongside the huge and still-dominant public sector has fostered dislocations such as profiteering, corruption and inflation.
Introduction of macro-economic controls has been slow amid reluctance to let go entirely of state levers.
Deng preferred to set in motion the big picture and to use his unparalleled political clout to push through economic policies rather than to get involved with the policy basics.
When he did, he called on occasion for bolder and faster growth -- preferring what he called ""short-term pain"" to ensure long-term gain but resulting in sometimes harmful policies that had to be followed by periods of moderation.
""Deng was a politician, a manager and a generalist whose most successful role was as the political godfather of economic reform,"" Naughton wrote.
"
JaneMacartney,"China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died late on Wednesday of complications from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection, the Communist Party announced.
The official announcement listed Deng's age as 93. He was born on August 22, 1904, but China adds a year to a person's age after the lunar new year, which fell earlier this month.
Announcement of Deng's death came in a letter to the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army and the people of various ethnic groups throughout China and issued by the official Xinhua news agency.
Deng, the man whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, died at 21.08 (1308 GMT) in Beijing, Xinhua said.
The party and government ""proclaim with profound grief to the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country that our beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping... passed away"", Xinhua said.
Deng was in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease with complications of lung infections and died of respiratory failure after he did not respond to emergency treatment, Xinhua said.
Chinese sources close to the party said doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy on Deng before he died.
The streets were quiet and calm after China's announcement came in the middle of the night, but additional police were seen around the Zhongnanhai government compound in central Beijing and some major intersections.
Two armed police carrying assault rifles stood guard at the end of the lane in central Beijing where Deng had lived and questioned reporters who tried to stop in the area.
Visitors in small groups were going in and out of the compound where Deng lived, on a leafy alley behind the Forbidden City that once housed China's emperors.
Analysts said they expected a relatively stable transition of power since Deng's anointed successor Jiang Zemin has already amassed the positions of Communist Party chief, state President and head of the armed forces.
The official Xinhua news agency began to issue a lengthy obiturary filled with praise for the man who ruled China from 1978 until he retired from his last official post in 1990, but whose influence remained supreme until his death.
""Comrade Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout China,"" Xinhua said.
It called him ""a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, and a long-tested communist fighter, the chief architect of China's socialist reforms, opening up and modernisation drive, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
The long stream of titles that did not omit any of the adjectives that China's Communist Party associates with a senior leader in a eulogy, was an official mark that the party planned to ensure Deng was buried with full party honours, analysts said.
Deng had not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival, when he appeared frail and faltering in a visit to Shanghai.
Chinese sources told Reuters earlier this week that Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng both cut short out-of-town trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit the ailing patriarch.
"
JaneMacartney,"Beijing's parliament began the process on Wednesday of upgrading the southwestern city of Chongqing to become China's fourth municipality along with such cities as Beijing and Shanghai.
Approval by the National People's Congress for the proposal will give Chongqing, a port on the Yangtze river in southwestern Sichuan province, the power to make its own decisions and handle its own finances without recourse to provincial authorities.
Chinese sources said the decision had met opposition from provincial authorities in Sichuan, reluctant to lose control of the largest city and biggest industrial base in China's most populous province of more than 103 million inhabitants.
With ratification of the proposal by China's rubber-stamp parliament virtually assured, Chongqing's area will expand to include two outlying cities and a prefecture, enlarging its population from 14 million to 30 million, the Xinhua news agency said.
The decision will pave the way to accelerate relocation of about one million people who must move to make way for the huge lake that will be created after the Three Gorges dam blocks the Yangtze river, downstream from Chongqing, it said.
A municipality has the same status as a province in China and falls under the direct authority of the central government. The other three municipalities are Beijing, Shanghai and the northern port city of Tianjin.
Supporting the motion from the State Council, or cabinet, to upgrade Chongqing, Premier Li Peng told parliament the move would give the city control of the Three Gorges scheme, thus boosting management of the world's largest water control project.
It would also help Chongqing to fuel economic development in western China, which has lagged far behind the boom in eastern coastal areas fuelled by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's market reforms, Li said.
""The upgrading of Chongqing will help promote the economic and social development of the southwest area and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,"" Li said.
It would also ease pressure on the Sichuan provincial government in managing the huge population of the city.
More than two-thirds of the estimated one million people who must be moved out of the way of the Three Gorges hydro power project would be resettled in Chongqing and its satellite cities of Wanxian, and Fuling, Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering told parliament.
""Chongqing municipality could handle the general administration of the relocation work,"" he told a parliament standing committee session that opened on Wednesday.
In recent interviews, officials in Chongqing said the move would raise the political profile of the mega-city.
As a municipality, Chongqing envisaged an economic boom that would narrow the gap between impoverished inland provinces in the west and their wealthy coastal cousins in the east, officials said.
For years after the communists swept to power in 1949, Chongqing -- wartime capital of rival Nationalists from 1938 to 1945 -- took a back seat to Chengdu, capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Its elevation to municipality at the full session of parliament next month would end its backward role, officials said.
"
JaneMacartney,"When China wanted to hide the death of an emperor on the road 2,000 years ago it filled his carriage with fish to disguise the smell.
Now it uses enigmatic language to throw a smokescreen around the state of its leaders' health.
Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who remains China's most powerful leader even though he formally retired from his last official post in 1990, is 92 and frail, and has not been seen in public for more than three years.
China's Communist Party leaders have shrouded Deng and his health in a veil of secrecy, issuing only terse statements saying he is as well as can be expected for a man of his advanced years, or that there has been ""no big change"".
""This is Chinese culture,"" said one Western diplomat. ""The emperor can't be seen to be dying until he actually dies.""
The power struggle on the death of a Chinese emperor -- or communist strongman -- has traditionally been bloody, and analysts say the departure of Deng is unlikely to be an exception.
When China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, died while travelling in the south in 210 BC, his prime minister filled the emperor's carriage with fish for two weeks to hide the smell of the rotting corpse, fearing a power struggle before he could reach the capital.
China's communist leaders will probably not conceal the death of Deng for as long as two weeks -- the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 was announced within 12 hours of his passing.
But they are doing their utmost to prevent hard information on any deterioration in Deng's health from reaching the 1.2 billion Chinese whose fate could hang in the balance.
The instinct for self-preservation and a Chinese abhorrence of any talk of death may be two motivations behind the secrecy of Deng's anointed successor, Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin, and his colleagues.
""There is always a nexus between the health of the nation and its leader,"" said a Western sinologist who declined to be identified. ""In a culture so concerned with life and longevity... death is the ultimate horror.""
One Chinese analyst agreed.
""In China's current system, the fate of the nation depends on the fate of the leader,"" he said.
""They are not only afraid that news that Deng is close to death could spark a really fierce power struggle, but they also worry about public instability,"" he said.
Deng is not the only powerful communist veteran of Mao's generation who still lives, and any elder who outlives Deng could step into his shoes as kingmaker and force a power struggle around Jiang.
Most diplomats say Jiang has already consolidated his position as Deng's successor in the party, government and military and say major blood-letting is unlikely after Deng's death. Jiang has even disbanded Deng's personal office.
""I don't think it's going to come as a shock to anybody when he finally does pass away,"" another Western diplomat said.
""It's not going to really mean a big shake-up in the leadership here or tanks rolling down the street,"" she said.
Still Beijing prefers to keep Deng's situation a secret. China's communist rulers inherit a system of based on veneration for age.
""It is highly disrespectful to the leader to discuss his health in public,"" said the Western sinologist.
"
JaneMacartney,"The fragile health of China's 92-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping on Wednesday stirred intense speculation among Japanese and Hong Kong newspapers after the country's leaders cut short out-of-town trips.
Deng was critically ill after suffering a brain haemorrhage, the Japanese daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said, quoting sources in the Chinese capital.
""According to diplomatic sources in Beijing, the health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who has implemented policies of reform..., worsened and he was in a critical condition on February 18,"" the newspaper said.
Chinese sources said on Monday that Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng had both cut short out-of-town trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit Deng.
The newspaper said sources close to senior officials in the People's Liberation Army said that Deng had ""recently suffered a brain haemorrhage"".
The Chinese leadership had told senior party and government officials not to leave the country unless obliged to do so for pressing diplomatic reasons, it said.
Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper said Deng was recuperating at home with a team of doctors attending to him.
Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded central Beijing compound close to the Forbidden City, home for centuries to China's emperors.
On Tuesday, China had played down fears that Deng's health was deteriorating.
""There has been no big change in comrade Deng Xiaoping's health,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang told a news briefing.
He declined to say if there had been a small change or what could count as a major change in the health of the ailing patriarch.
Rumours about Deng's health surface periodically and often have a direct impact on China-related bourses, where Deng's demise is seen by some as a potentially destabilising factor.
Worries over Deng's health helped to push shares on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges sharply lower by their close on Tuesday and also rocked share prices in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
The markets recovered slightly on Wednesday, but traders remained cautious about Deng's health.
In an apparent bid to calm the markets, major Chinese newspapers prominently featured economic tsar Zhu Rongji attending a seminar on the economic theories of Deng, architect of China's sweeping economic reforms.
The Chinese Securities newspaper, read by most traders in the market, announced the seminar in a front-page box to draw attention to the fact that Deng was still alive.
Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival, when he appeared frail and faltering. He is thought to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity.
Taiwan's United Daily News on Tuesday quoted the island's top official on mainland affairs, Chang King-yuh, as saying Deng's condition was serious. Officials said they were closely monitoring his health.

JaneMacartney,"China's crown rests uneasily on the head of Deng Xiaoping's anointed successor, Jiang Zemin.
Deng's death after an 18-year rule opens the door to a power struggle in the communist political elite, throwing into relief Deng's major failure -- his inability to set in place a firm succession structure.
Many diplomats and political analysts said they expected Jiang to tighten his grip on the top job after seven years building a powerbase under the wing of his patron.
But the absence of a proper structure and the removal of his mentor leaves him exposed in one of the most precarious positions in the world.
""With Deng's death the political ring of confidence that so protected Jiang Zemin has been torn asunder and he must now face an uncertain political future and political ills by himself,"" said Australian sinologist Geremie Barme.
Deng was the last leader of China's communist era who could back his claim with an impeccable revolutionary pedigree -- a founder of socialist rule, a victorious veteran of the Long March and battles that swept the Communist Party to power and a colleague of Chairman Mao Zedong.
Jiang's resume is not so impressive.
But, aware of his weakness, he has devoted much of his time to building up his powerbase -- particularly in the military -- after his two predecessors were purged following student demonstrations.
He has amassed the positions of party boss, state president and head of the armed forces.
""Jiang Zemin is a student of Chinese history and Chinese politics and he is very clear that the military hold the key to political power. As the Mao Zedong dictum said, 'political power comes from the barrel of the gun',"" said Hong Kong-based analyst Tai Ming Cheung.
But, he said, the military's support is not unqualified and Jiang will have to ""provide additional finances and allow the military an important say"".
Barme said Jiang's capture of China's three top jobs was unprecedented in the 20th century -- but also dangerous because he was now the only real target for a takeover bid.
Diplomats and analysts said that while Jiang appeared comfortable in the immediate aftermath to Deng's death, he could not afford to be complacent.
""There is a lot of horse trading that has already been taking place, and with Deng's passing it complicates matters a little, perhaps not significantly,"" said Cheung.
But Jiang was now facing the real test of his career, and of Deng's succession plans, diplomats said.
""It has been Jiang Zemin's good fortune that Deng Xiaoping lasted this long,"" said one Western diplomat.
"
JaneMacartney,"China on Thursday began six days of mourning for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping after an 18-year rule that transformed China from backward Stalinist state to economic powerhouse. He was 92.
A letter from the ruling Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to China's 1.2 billion people expressed profound grief at the death of ""a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat"".
China's Foreign Ministry announced six days of mourning, indicating Deng's funeral could take place on February 25.
The gravel-voiced veteran of military battlefields and backroom political struggles died at 9.08 p.m. (1308 GMT) on Wednesday in Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Deng, whose pragmatic market reforms propelled China onto the world stage as an emerging economic superpower, was in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. He died of respiratory failure after he did not respond to emergency treatment.
Chinese sources close to the party said doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy to try to save Deng, reportedly in the crimson-walled Zhongnanhai government compound just off Tiananmen Square.
The party and government ""proclaim with profound grief to the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country that our beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping... passed away"", Xinhua said.
His career spanned much of the 20th century, from the last emperor to the birth of China as a nuclear power. He swept to power in 1978 after being purged three times and retired only in 1990.
He led China from Mao Zedong's ultra-leftist fervour to a nation at its most stable and prosperous for nearly 200 years, and his influence reigned supreme until his death.
He died without achieving one of his dreams -- to be present in Hong Kong when the colony, wrested from China at gunpoint by the British as spoils of victory in the opium wars, returns to Beijing's sovereignty at midnight on June 30 this year.
No foreign dignitaries would be invited to the funeral, Chjina said.
Flags were flying at half-mast in Tiananmen Square and at the Great Hall of the People, as well at Chinese embassies around the world ""to express the incomparable esteem and profound grief of the whole Party, the whole army and the people"".
Condolences poured in for Deng, who had not been seen in public since the Chinese lunar new year festival in 1994 when he appeared frail and faltering on a visit to Shanghai.
U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was saddened to learn of Deng's death, calling him an ""extraordinary figure on the world stage over the past two decades"".
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he was saddened and pledged to ""continue to work with China's leaders for the long-term stability of our bilateral relationship"".
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien voiced regret but said his feelings were mixed due to Deng's record on human rights.
Deng died almost within sight of Tiananmen Square, where troops and tanks of the People's Liberation Army, acting on Deng's orders, crushed student-led demonstrations for more democracy with heavy loss of life in 1989.
Diplomats said immediate factional struggle was unlikely in the China's internecine political world, because Deng's anointed heir, party chief Jiang Zemin had a firm grip on power.
Factory manager and technocrat Jiang has already amassed the positions of party chief, state President and head of the armed forces. But Jiang is 70, and will soon have to confront his own succession dilemma.
An official obituary on Deng from Xinhua urged China's 1.2 billion people to rally behind his heir.
Chinese responded with shock and sadness to news of Deng's demise, but without the great outpouring of grief that greeted Mao's death in 1976.
""Then we cried like we lost our father and mother,"" said one driver parked near Deng's central Beijing residence. ""Now everyone is indifferent.""
Streets were quiet and calm on Thursday, although extra police patrolled outside Zhongnanhai and military cars with flashing lights drove along main city streets.
Police stood guard around the compound in central Beijing where Deng lived, turning away mourners bringing wreaths.
Stock markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were highly volatile on Thursday, contrary to forecasts by market pundits who expected a moderate response to Deng's death.
Reaction in U.S. markets had been muted and many other Asian markets also showed little if any response to the news, focusing instead on domestic considerations.
The People's Daily newspaper splashed a black-and-white portrait of a smiling Deng over much of its front page and all newspapers ran a black masthead.
""Comrade Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout China,"" Xinhua's lengthy obituary said.
It called Deng ""a long-tested communist fighter, the chief architect of China's socialist reforms, opening up and modernisation drive, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
"
JaneMacartney,"Deng Xiaoping's most daring attempt at reform of China was also among his most dismal failures -- politics.
It was an omission that will haunt his successors.
His anointed heir, Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin, will also almost certainly inherit a power struggle in a country where political structures have yet to fully enshrine the handover of power.
Deng, who died late on Wednesday aged 92, had raised the prospect of democracy, ensuring tens of millions of peasants have the right to elect local representatives.
But he failed to build a structure that would solve the centuries-old problem of how an emperor could hand down power after he passed from the scene.
Deng regarded political reform, complemented by economic invigoration, as crucial to the survival of Communist Party rule.
""In essence the purpose of political restructuring is to overcome bureaucratism, develop socialist democracy and stimulate the initiative of the people and of the grass-roots units,"" Deng told a Japanese visitor in September 1986.
The main aims he emphasised after he gained power in late 1978 were separation of party and government roles, rejuvenation of the leadership and re-establishment of party democracy.
""For Deng, democracy is a way of making the communist party state more efficient,"" wrote David Goodman in ""Deng Xiaoping.""
He never envisaged a system of universal suffrage and was therefore forced to crush those who went too far by demanding Western-style democracy and finally to settle for superficial reform that would not allow any threat to party supremacy.
His combination of rapid economic reform alongside gradual political change saved China's Communist Party from the fate of its Soviet cousin -- where rapid political reform toppled a regime that did not press ahead on the economic front.
He ended up creating a system in which the party held sway as a virtual parasite to a parallel government, economic and social structure and where corruption and abuse of power flourished in the loopholes.
Deng separated functions of party and government to stop the party interfering to replace government, to prevent over-concentration of authority in party and in individual hands and to end absence of responsibility in the bureaucracy.
The party should guide, not govern, in Deng's view.
By the time of his death, the government was responsible for administration, it was the executor of decisions on policy that were the prerogative of the party.
Deng pulled no punches in injecting new blood into a party leadership riddled with ageing veterans after the upheaval of the 1966-76 radical Cultural Revolution.
He battled stiff opposition to shunt elders into a temporary holding pen -- the Central Advisory Commission, which he was finally able to retire in 1993.
To try to ensure an orderly succession, he set an example by stepping down from a string of public offices, abandoning all his positions by the end of 1989.
But he was forced to appoint and then sack two heirs apparent.
His third choice, Jiang Zemin -- also chosen by Deng personally to head the party -- survived until Deng's death, but with no orderly succession pattern yet in place to prevent the usually brutal and often bloody succession struggles that have followed the deaths of Chinese emperors for centuries.
Encouragement of party-led democracy -- emphasis on the need to stimulate individual and group initiative -- was the third plank in his political reform programme.
""In the final analysis, all our other reforms depend on the success of political reforms, because it is human beings who will -- or will not -- carry them out,"" Deng said in 1986.
""Without political reform, economic reform cannot succeed because the first obstacle to overcome is people's resistance.""
Deng drew the line when the enthusiasm of the people for political reform became too extreme with open calls for democracy, and he sent the army to kill unarmed students who urged greater openness in the spring of 1989.
He did allow limited democracy, with villages all over China empowered to elect district leaders from a pool of more than one candidate but free speech and publication of ideas and assembly were going too far.
Those limits may influence a final judgment on his standing in Chinese history.
""In the annals of history there is only a small chapter devoted to those who advanced economic progress,"" wrote Lucian W. Pye in ""Deng Xiaoping: Portrait of a Chinese Statesman"".
""The big chapters are reserved for those leaders who brought political freedom and security to their people.""
"
JaneMacartney,"China's President Jiang Zemin, speaking publicly for the first time since the death of Deng Xiaoping, vowed on Friday to push forward the reforms that his mentor launched 18 years ago.
""The Communist Party of China, the Chinese army and people of various ethnic groups are determined to turn grief into strength,"" Jiang told Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is on holiday in China.
Speaking for the first time in public since Deng died, aged 92, on Wednesday, Deng's designated heir pledged to ""hold high the great banner of Deng's theory to build socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
China would unite to pursue Deng's reforms and opening up ""unswervingly and confidently"", the Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as saying.
Jiang repeated almost word for word the official obituary of the pragmatic reformer whose belief that China's people should be allowed to get rich ended a decade of chaotic rule by Mao Zedong, who believed his people should be ""red"" -- communist.
However, it was Jiang's first personal and public commitment that he planned to press on with Deng's capitalist-style reforms that have transformed China from a backward Stalinist state to an economic powerhouse.
""We would run China's undertakings still better, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, development and progress of the mankind,"" Jiang was quoted as saying.
The death of Deng was ""an immeasurable loss"" to the Party, army and people of China, Jiang said.
Jiang, who also holds the posts of Communist Party chief and head of the armed forces, emerged on Deng's death to rule China after seven years in waiting as his heir apparent.
Diplomats say Jiang may soon find himself embroiled in a power struggle with other pretenders to power in the highest echelons of the ruling party.
China's leadership has carefully displayed a united front.
China-watchers say this may be a facade.
""It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent,"" said one Chinese analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb.
In imperial China, the transfer of the ""mandate of heaven"" to a new emperor was rarely smooth. Deng only came to power in late 1978 after a two-year battle with Mao's appointed successor, Hua Guofeng.
The latest power shift has so far been seamless, but analysts said later upheavals could not be ruled out.
Jiang's first test will be at the crucial 15th Party Congress, which is expected to be held in October and is to elect a new central committee, politburo and party chief. The post of party chief, or general secretary, is the most powerful in China.
At least one contest will be over a crusade by Premier Li Peng, 68, to try to retain his slot on the politburo standing committee -- the most powerful decision-making body in China.
Li must step down as premier in 1998, after completing the maximum two terms, and is keen to make a play for the top party post so that he can remain in the hierarchy after he retires from the government job, analysts say.
"
JaneMacartney,"China eulogised Deng Xiaoping on Friday, hailing the diminutive patriarch as a giant whose stature could never be matched and pledging the army's loyalty to his political heirs.
As flags around the capital flew at half-mast on the second day of official mourning for Deng, who died on Wednesday at 92, the judiciary sounded a cautious note, issuing a nationwide call for stability.
Security was discreet and the atmosphere calm in the capital. People hurried to work as usual on a bright and crisp Friday morning.
But hundreds of grieving people gathered in Deng's birthplace Paifang, a tiny village in southwestern Sichuan, some kneeling on the ground and weeping.
Police armed with assault rifles moved in to ensure order, local officials said. No incidents were reported.
""Comrade Deng Xiaoping... became a great son of the people, a giant who will never be matched,"" the People's Daily said in a commentary. ""The people of the motherland love and esteem him.""
State radio and television poured out glowing tributes for a second day to the 150 cm (5 ft) communist revolutionary who transformed China from an isolated economic pygmy into a burgeoning behemoth.
Communist cells in the military vowed to ensure the world's biggest armed forces remained loyal to his heir, Jiang Zemin, who holds the jobs of Communist Party chief, state President and head of the three-million-strong armed forces.
""The party committees of the military say they will continue to lead the armed forces to rally more closely around the Central Committee and the Military Commission with Jiang Zemin at the core,"" Xinhua news agency said.
Analysts said Jiang was determined to ensure a smooth transition, especially in the first days after Deng's death when opponents will be poised to seize on any policy error.
The Supreme People's Court, China's top judicial body, ordered all courts to ensure strict law enforcement and to safeguard social stability, Xinhua said.
The chief economist for the State Statistical Bureau issued a special announcement that Deng's passing would not harm the economy, which is shooting up by 10 percent a year.
Political transitions in communist China in the past have been fraught with difficulty and the deaths of senior leaders have triggered mass protests more than once.
Political analysts said Deng's passing was unlikely to be marked by unrest.
Many predict a power struggle sooner or later, but fought behind the scenes, well away from public scrutiny.
After nearly eight years wielding effective power under Deng's wing, Jiang has built up a powerbase and is seen as the man most likely to lead China's 1.2 billion people into the 21st century.
Most people followed their daily routines despite the loss of the gravelly-voiced socialist reformer who set the world's most populous nation on the road from revolutionary communism to a capitalist-style market economy.
Popular reaction has been subdued, ranging from shock and sadness to indifference.
""I have no feelings. Deng was nothing to me,"" said a 62-year-old snack vendor. ""The old go out, the new come in.""
A few wept. ""I felt very bad when I heard the news,"" said a farmer from Shanxi. ""He was a great man.""
State media was effusive. The people had vowed to turn their grief into strength to carry on the reforms Deng launched in 1978.
Authorities have decreed six days of mourning until the funeral on Tuesday when 10,000 people will gather in the Great Hall of the People.
In a letter to the leadership, Deng's widow and family appealed for a simple farewell for the lifelong Marxist.
When he retired in 1989, Deng himself said: ""I hope you will see to it that both my retirement and my funeral are simple.""
Deng wanted his corneas to be donated to an eye bank and his body dissected for medical research. His ashes were to be scattered at sea, said his widow, two sons and three daughters in their letter.
It was a vivid contrast to the treatment accorded Deng's formidable predecessor, Mao Zedong, when he died 21 years ago. After a national outpouring of grief, he was embalmed. His remains are displayed in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.
""As a complete materialist, Comrade Xiaoping always has a philosophical view of life and death,"" said the Deng family letter, written four days before he died.
China had long been prepared for the departure of its paramount leader. Deng was last seen in Shanghai in 1994, a daughter supporting his fragile frame, his chain-smoker's voice reduced to a hoarse whisper.
"
JaneMacartney,"China's President Jiang Zemin has emerged to rule China after seven years in waiting as heir apparent to Deng Xiaoping and, at 70, among his most pressing tasks will be to identify his own successor.
Diplomats said finding an heir could be crucial for Jiang if he is to ward off attacks from ambitious younger men or from power-hungry elders who want to run the show from behind a bamboo curtain -- the means chosen by China's Empress Dowager 100 years ago.
""Jiang Zemin, who while Deng Xiaoping was alive was the young successor, has become at the moment of Deng's death the incumbent leader who is immediately faced with a succession crisis,"" said Australian Sinologist Geremie Barme.
China's leadership has carefully displayed a united front since Deng died on Wednesday aged 92.
China-watchers say this may be a facade.
""It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent,"" said one Chinese analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb.
In imperial China, the transfer of the ""mandate of heaven"" to a new emperor was rarely smooth. While the latest power shift so far has been seamless, analysts said later upheavals could not be ruled out.
Jiang must now confront his own mortality and fend off other aspirants to power, among them Qiao Shi, the former security tsar who now heads parliament, economic supremo Zhu Rongji and Premier Li Peng.
He will also face assault on his authority from the last two surviving veterans of Deng's generation, former president Yang Shangkun, 89, and former head of parliament Peng Zhen, 95, whose communist credentials are second only to those of Deng.
In a system where Deng held supreme power until he drew his last breath -- even though he retired from his last post in 1990 and never held a top job -- political pedigree and traditional respect for age rank high.
Political acumen will be crucial.
In the seven years since he was launched into China's top job, Jiang has toiled to make his position unassailable, battling to boost support while picking his way through the political minefield at the top of the party.
Analysts say he certainly now ranks as first among equals in a society that finds itself without an all-powerful strongman for the first time this century, but he may have tried too hard.
""Unlike Deng Xiaoping, Jiang has shown himself to be an unwise political strategist for he has, in an unprecedented move in post-imperial Chinese history, claimed and maintained control of all three major arms of power,"" Barme said.
""It is strategically suicidal,"" he said. ""It is not wise to be front man in everything.""
Analysts said the time may have come for Jiang, well above the official retirement age of 65, to act quickly.
""If he was a wise leader, he would quickly manoeuvre himself into a position where he could appoint a successor who could carry out his legacy -- just as Deng appointed a successor,"" Barme said.
""So Jiang is faced with the urgent task of devolving power to younger leaders, but may not have the wisdom to carry out such a strategic reformulation of his position"".
Diplomats agreed that Jiang's amassing of top jobs could hurt rather than help his survival after Deng.
His most immediate challenge comes from Premier Li Peng, who completes his second and final term next March, but whose future post must be decided, albeit in secret, at the crucial 15th Party Congress in October.
Li wants another job. He wants to be president -- or better still head of the party -- and he can argue that Jiang should give up at least one of his jobs, Chinese political analysts say.
But Jiang cannot afford to give up his job as head of the party, and doesn't want to stop being president. Therein lies the future power struggle.
""Jiang Zemin enjoys the trappings of power,"" said one Western diplomat. ""He likes the pomp and ceremony, the fanfare and red-carpet treatment. He likes to bask in the limelight.
""That is a reason why the Li Peng question is so problematic,"" he said.
""If Jiang were willing to give up the presidency then the retirement of Li Peng from the premiership would not create so many problems.""
"
JaneMacartney,"China's Deng Xiaoping launched the greatest economic boom on earth and justified his reforms to doubting Marxist ideologues with one deceptively simple phrase.
The maxim that Deng used as an ideological figleaf to cover his near-heretical treatment of Marxist economics was ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
The phrase that would justify private enterprise, ownership of property and lifting of price controls in a state run by the Communist Party saw the light of day in Deng's opening speech to the 12th party congress on September 1, 1982.
""We must integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of China, blaze a path of our own and build a socialism with Chinese characteristics -- that is the basic conclusion we have reached after summing up long historical experience,"" Deng told the elders of the central committee.
The congress was crucial for Deng's nascent economic reforms, already running into resistance from his orthodox Marxist colleagues who feared -- rightly as it turned out -- that his employment of market forces would erode three decades of Stalinist command economics.
""Deng's greatest contribution of all was that simple phrase 'Chinese characteristics',"" said one Western diplomat.
""It ensured that you could do anything you thought was appropriate. It should be engraved on his tomb.""
That single phrase enabled Deng to dump the revolutionary fervour nurtured by the late chairman Mao Zedong in favour of doing pretty much what he wanted.
""This was a huge leap forward compared with the Mao era,"" said a Chinese political scientist. ""This sentence guided China on to the path of modernisation. It marked the shift from Mao's path to Deng's path and enabled Deng to do an enormous number of things.""
It ended the sole system of public ownership. Collective and private enterprises were born. It also ended cradle-to-grave care and control by the party.
Chinese could be sacked, they could resign. They were free to find their own jobs. They could move house. They had to pay for their own education and medical care.
The command economy gave way to market forces.
What Deng created was no longer socialism, neither was it capitalism.
It was somewhere in between. It was socialism with Chinese characteristics.
"
JaneMacartney,"It began with a whimper, culminated in an economic explosion and was one of the most far-reaching events of the 20th century.
Deng Xiaoping's 1992 move to kick-start an economy faltering after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre strengthened his conservative opponents was a high point of his career and launched an economic boom that has reverberated around the world.
In January 1992, Deng, then 87, toured the boomtown of Shenzhen that borders Hong Kong in what has gone down in history as his ""nan xun"" or Southern Tour.
For more than two months not a newspaper in China's Communist Party controlled media machine published even a word of Deng's unprecedented visit, underlining the extent to which China's paramount leader -- by then retired from all formal posts -- had lost control of the powerful propaganda apparatus.
Hardline leftists who opposed Deng's bid to place his stamp of approval on the flourishing Shenzhen Special Economic Zone that was his brainchild blocked for weeks any news of his tour.
But in late March of that year, Deng and his loyalists succeeded in pushing aside the propaganda tsars and his ""Southern Tour"" burst upon the Chinese public through primetime state television and splashed across whole pages of state-run newspapers.
It marked the start of a new era in the reform process that Deng had launched in 1979.
That southern tour unsheathed a double-edged sword of rising incomes and galloping inflation but many Chinese said on Saturday they were much better off than in the pre-Deng era.
""Mao made the Chinese stand up but Deng made us rich,"" said Yang Baisong, a 41-year-old taxi driver in Beijing.
""I can make 8-9,000 yuan ($960-$1,080) a month,"" Yang said. ""That's pretty good and this car is my own.""
China's economy is the fastest growing on earth, sizzling at 9.7 percent last year after three years of double-digit growth.
Deng, always impatient with economic reform, had acted out of deep frustration with the slow pace of economic change after hardliners regained the offensive in the wake of the bloody crackdown on student-led pro-democracy dissent in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
Opposition to reform had come from top level bureaucrats, Marxist purists and Deng's own gerontocratic peers whose power and privilege stemmed from four decades of central planning.
The media barrage of March 1992 marked a strategic turning point in Deng's campaign to outflank conservative opponents in the capital.
At the same time, it exposed his own weakness in that he had to head south to areas where reform had found their strongest hold to push his agenda because he was unable to win a hearing in the bastion of conservativism in Beijing.
The Southern Tour marked an unprecedented interference in the political process and revealed China's worst-kept secret -- that he was the man really running the country.
It was Deng's first public appearance in more than a year -- he had deliberately faded from the scene to boost the stature and credibility of his chosen heir, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin who was appointed after the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
In scarcely-veiled criticisms in Shenzhen, Deng revealed the extent of his disappointment with his anointed successor and with Premier Li Peng -- both too weak or too conservative to press the radical economic change that Deng believed was the only way to ensure the party retained power.
""We should be even bolder than before in conducting reform and opening to the outside and have the courage to experiment,"" he said in Shenzhen.
""We must not act like women with bound feet,"" he said.
"
JaneMacartney,"China's most powerful man has boldly asserted he will outperform his mentor Deng Xiaoping, the late leader who dumped Communist economic orthodoxy to wrench the world's most populous nation into the modern era.
Jiang Zemin, Deng's anointed successor with top posts in the Communist Party, the government and the military, waited just two days after Deng died on Wednesday before implying that the reformist had left much undone.
""We would run China's undertakings still better, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, development and progress of the mankind,"" Jiang told visiting Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Friday.
To ordinary Chinese Jiang's words, his first statement since the end of the 18-year long Deng era of market reforms under Communist control, were an unmistakeable rebuke.
""Of course that's a criticism,"" said a Chinese worker without hesitation.
Jiang spoke even before the last rites were observed for Deng, whose no-frills memorial rites are scheduled for next Tuesday in Beijing's enormous Great Hall of the People.
To some analysts, Jiang's remarks showed self-assurance, but also smacked of disrespect and arrogance that he may regret in the event of backstage power plays that are the traditional aftermath to the death of a strongman in China.
Chinese leaders have projected an image of seamless transition, mindful of the political tumult that enveloped China following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.
But the seeds of a power struggle became visible even as Deng lay on his deathbed.
The February issue of a magazine called Zhongliu, or Mainstay, controlled by ultra-leftists, obliquely criticised Deng's successor in what a political analyst described as ""the first cannon fired by leftists at Jiang Zemin"".
In China's arcane political world, power struggles are fought behind the scenes and traditionally emerge into the public eye only when they erupt in the state media.
The language used by the magazine was reminiscent of the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that Mao used to purge his opponents, analysts said.
""The magazine is trying to stir up debate reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution... to oust Jiang Zemin,"" one said.
In a deliberately understated response to Deng's death, Chinese authorities made little effort to organise memorial activities.
In central Beijing's Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989 student-led protests smashed by the military acting at Deng's behest, at least two people have been detained while trying to show final respects to the late leader.
State television has run endless paeans to Deng and showed formal mourning activities organised by Chinese officials in Hong Kong, Washington and other foreign cities.
In China itself, the citizenry have been left to do things themselves.
In Deng's home village of Paifang in southwestern Sichuan province, tens of thousands of mourners have thronged to the courtyard of his birth since the community's favourite son died. Deng himself left Paifang at 16 and never returned.
In the Sichuan capital Chengdu, people began spilling into People's Square on Thursday and by nightfall the crowd swelled past 10,000, many carrying candles, witnesses said.
""For us here it's tumultuous,"" a worker at a hotel on the square said.
In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, a special economic zone near Hong Kong that was Deng's brainchild, hundreds of people filed past a giant Deng billboard which had been turned into a makeshift shrine.
The billboard stands in a square beside one of Deng's most stunning innovations, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which Deng said proved that markets were acceptable not only in capitalist societies but also under socialism.
Deng's reforms unsheathed the double-edged sword of rising incomes and galloping inflation but many Chinese said on Saturday they were much better off than in the pre-Deng era.
""Mao made the Chinese stand up but Deng made us rich,"" said Yang Baisong, a 41-year-old taxi driver in Beijing.
"
JaneMacartney,"China's President Jiang Zemin issued a pledge on Saturday to outdo late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in pursuing the capitalist-style reforms that his patron vowed would carry China through the next 100 years.
Jiang, who with Deng's death at 92 on Wednesday became undisputedly the most powerful man in China, waited a scant two days before hinting that ""the chief architect"" of reforms that have transformed the face of China in just 18 years had only started a job that he (Jiang) meant to finish.
""We would run China's undertakings still better, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, development and progress of the mankind,"" Jiang told visiting Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
To ordinary Chinese, Jiang's first public words following the death of the man credited with creating China's extraordinarily successful combination of communism and capitalism were an unmistakeable rebuke.
""Of course that's a criticism,"" said a Chinese worker without hesitation.
However, Jiang was also swift to nail his colours to Deng's reforms and opening to the outside world that transformed an isolated Stalinist state into a fledgling economic superpower.
Jiang, who is also China's Communist Party chief and the head of the military, was hand-picked by Deng to be his successor and holds most of the cards needed to replace him.
But for some analysts, his swift attempt to assume Deng's personal mantle smacked of arrogance that could prove dangerous if a power struggle were to erupt.
China's secretive leadership has projected an image of seamless transition following Deng's death, mindful of the political tumult that enveloped the country following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 before Deng emerged.
But there were hints of discord even as the 92-year-old Deng lay dying.
The February issue of a magazine called Zhongliu, or Mainstay, controlled by ultra-leftists, obliquely criticised Deng's successor in what one political analyst described as ""the first cannon fired by leftists at Jiang Zemin"".
In China's arcane political world, power struggles are fought behind the scenes and traditionally emerge into the public eye only when they erupt in the state media.
The language used by the magazine was reminiscent of the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that Mao used to purge his opponents, analysts said.
""The magazine is trying to stir up debate reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution... to oust Jiang Zemin,"" one said.
Clearly fearing a repeat of the student-led demonstrations that marked the last funeral of a party luminary in 1989, police threw a security net around Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing and plainclothes officers patrolled university campuses.
Deng's memorial rites are scheduled for Tuesday in the cavernous Great Hall of the People on the edge of the square.
On Saturday, a People's Liberation Army honour guard rehearsed the cremation that is expected on Monday at a special cemetery for party heroes, shouldering a glass coffin with a live soldier inside -- apparently simulating China's late paramount leader.
State television has run endless paeans to Deng and showed formal mourning activities organised by Chinese officials in Hong Kong, Washington and other foreign cities.
At home, however, China has kept official reaction to Deng's death deliberately low-key, making little attempt to organise memorial activities that might spin out of control.
In central Beijing's Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989 student-led protests smashed by the military at Deng's behest, at least two people have been detained while trying to pay final respects to the late leader.
Tens of thousands of mourners thronged to the courtyard of his birth in his home village of Paifang in southwestern Sichuan province. In the Sichuan capital of Chengdu more than 10,000 people gathered in People's Square on Thursday to mark the passing of their province's favourite son.
In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, a special economic zone near Hong Kong where Deng first experimented with grafting capitalist-style markets on to a socialist economy, hundreds of people filed past a giant Deng billboard which had been turned into a makeshift shrine.
In Shanghai, which quickly reverted to its nimble trading ways under Deng's guidance, the city's familier profit mantra was joined by a new chant drifting skyward from the Jade Buddha Temple.
""The monks are praying for world peace and Deng Xiaoping,"" an attendant said. ""So that Deng will go to heaven.""

JaneMacartney,"The king is dead, long live the king.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has for seven years been designated to step into the shoes of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, and since Deng's death last week he has done so with almost foolhardy alacrity, analysts said on Sunday.
Western diplomats say they have been picking up signals for several months that Jiang has been trying to carve out his own place in history, distancing himself from his mentor, Deng, who died last Wednesday in Beijing aged 92.
But Chinese political analysts warn that Jiang is playing for major stakes against players who are not short of chips and who may have no qualms about cheating.
""Jiang Zemin is not a strongman. He's no Mao Zedong and he's no Deng Xiaoping,"" said one Chinese political analyst. ""He can't do whatever he likes.""
On the second day of official mourning after Deng's death, Jiang appeared to have taken a bold first step in the shadowy political minuet danced by those who rule China from the highest echelons of the Communist Party.
Jiang vowed even greater successes than those achieved by Deng in pushing ahead with the diminutive patriarch's capitalist-style reforms.
""Jiang Zemin committed a political blunder,"" said one well-connected political analyst. ""He said it too early. He could have waited.
""He's giving his political rivals something with which to attack him,"" he said.
""Deng Xiaoping had qualities that differed from Mao Zedong. But what does Jiang Zemin have?"" he asked.
That question may be on the lips not only of political analysts but of Jiang's rivals to rule China.
Since imperial China, the transfer of the ""mandate of heaven"" to a new emperor -- or party chief -- has rarely been smooth. The latest power shift so far has been seamless, but upheavals cannot be ruled out, analysts said.
In recent days, Jiang has come under veiled attack from leftist hardliners who are nostalgic for Mao's authoritarian rule and who see Deng's death as an opportunity to push their conservative policies.
Jiang, 70, must now confront his own mortality and fend off other aspirants to power, among them Qiao Shi, the former security tsar who now heads parliament, economic supremo Zhu Rongji and Premier Li Peng.
Jiang appears strong, after amassing the top jobs in the party, the government and the three-million-strong armed forces. But analysts say his opponents are well-placed to expose his weaknesses.
""For Jiang Zemin right now, he is much in the running,"" said one Western diplomat. ""He has especially in the last year made a very decisive break from being under Deng's shadow.
""He had been always very cautious to keep within Deng's policy line,"" he said. ""But in the past year, he has significantly defined himself as someone who is very separate from Deng.""
He may have been over-ambitious in taking all of China's top three positions.
The only other communist official to hold those three posts was Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, a colourless rural bureaucrat who was deposed within two years by Deng.
As one of the 459 members of Deng's Funeral Committee, Hua is expected to make a rare appearance at the memorial rites on Tuesday, a poignant reminder to Jiang -- who is expected to deliver the eulogy -- of what happens to those who lose out in a power struggle in China.
"
JaneMacartney,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin has refused a request from his predecessor, disgraced Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, to attend the funeral of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, a Chinese source said on Sunday.
Jiang gave Zhao no reason for barring him from attending the memorial rites for the man who personally appointed both men to China's top job, the source told Reuters.
Deng, who handpicked Zhao as his successor in 1987 only to sack him two years later for sympathising with student demonstrators gathered in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, died in the capital on Wednesday aged 92. His memorial rites will be held in the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday.
Zhao was in the scenic city of Hangzhou in eastern China where he had gone to spend the Chinese lunar New Year earlier this month, said the source who is close to Zhao.
Zhao had sent a request to Jiang and other top leaders the day after Deng died, asking for permission to return to the capital after learning of Deng's demise, the source said. Zhao lives under virtual house arrest in Beijing and can move around China only with the approval of the top leadership.
Jiang rejected Zhao's request even though Deng's family and some party veterans had agreed to allow him to attend the funeral, the source said. Deng's family could not be reached for comment.
""Not only will the leadership not let him attend the funeral, they also will not let him return to Beijing,"" said the source who asked not to be identified.
Zhao renewed his request on February 21, but the leadership had yet to respond, the source said.
Surveillance of Zhao was expected to tighten in the run-up to a crucial party congress later this year as Jiang, who has held the post of party chief since Zhao was sacked, tries to consolidate his power, the source said.
Zhao has not been seen in public since May 19, 1989 when he visited students occupying Tiananmen Square and, with tears in his eyes, beseeched their leaders to call off their pro-democracy demonstrations. The next day hardliners clamped martial law on the capital.
On June 3 and 4, troops firing automatic weapons and backed by tanks stormed the city centre, retaking the square and crushing the demonstrations with heavy loss of life.
Zhao was accused by his enemies of backing the ""counter-revolutionary turmoil"" and trying to split the party.
Diplomats say China's current leadership remains nervous of the influence of Zhao, whose relatively liberal political and economic policies made him popular while in office.
Party mandarins fear Zhao could be a wild card if he were to re-emerge from his virtual house arrest in a post-Deng power struggle, diplomats said.
Zhao has refused to acknowledge making mistakes, giving him some clout among Chinese who disagree with the verdict of hardliners that the 1989 protests were seditious, diplomats said.
The source said 77-year-old Zhao was in good health. He spends much of his time reading books and indulges his passion for golf about once a week.

JanLopatka,"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that improving the regulation of beleaguered Czech capital markets was on his agenda, but he took a shot at critics who have said the improvement was coming too slowly.
Speaking at a banking and finance forum in Prague, Klaus said that ""we are searching for new forms of regulations.""
""But I disagree with those critics, mostly foreigners, who look at the existing quality of our capital markets and are surprised that they do not equal Wall Street, the City of London or any other well-established western financial centre yet,"" Klaus told the conference.
""Their high-brow attitude and their absolutist, almost doctrinal phraseology is something what does not help much.""
However Klaus, a professor of economics and fierce anti-regulation campaigner, added that finding the right extent of capital market regulation was an ""imminent task"".
Many foreign equity analysts and investors frequently criticise the Czech markets for a lack of quality company information and clear pricing of shares, insider trading, and poor oversight of numerous investment funds.
Many analysts use Poland and its more stringent capital market regulation as an example of why the Warsaw Stock Exchange attracts much more foreign investment than Prague.
Separately, Klaus said that the country had too many banks and investment funds, and many were poorly managed.
A crisis in small private banks peaked last year when Agrobanka, the fifth largest and the largest fully-private bank, was put under forced administration by the central bank, the last and largest in a dozen recent interventions.
Klaus said a liberal approach to granting banking and capital markets licences in the early 1990's came from the need for more private financial houses and competition, and nobody knew what the right number of institutions would be.
""We have too many banks and too many investment funds now, and we also know that not all of them function perfectly or are in the best possible hands,"" Klaus said.
The Finance Ministry's capital markets oversight office has recently stepped up its activity with a wave of actions against illegal asset-stripping by managers of mostly smaller Czech investment funds.
But the ministry is still under fierce criticism from investors and the media for a lack of activity.
Klaus has revealed a plan to gradually separate the capital market supervision from the Finance Ministry, a process which has started in February by creating a separate Securities Bureau within the ministry.
Under the plan, the Czech Securities Registry started publishing over-the counter trades registred at the centre earlier this year.
Klaus also admitted that a period at the start of the privatisation process in the early 1990's when state firms were not yet privatised led to a loss of many assets as state supervision relaxed but new owners were still not in place.
""This is something what the future privatising countries should avoid,"" Klaus told the conference.

JanLopatka,"Ceska Sporitelna a.s., the largest Czech savings bank, said on Thursday its 1996 audited net profit rose to 1.89 billion crowns ($65 million) from 263 million in 1995, using Czech acounting standards.
Speaking at a news conference, the bank's general director Jaroslav Klapal said the result was opening room for a higher dividend than last year's five crowns per share, but he declined to specify what the board's proposal would be.
Deputy CEO Kamil Ziegler said results under international accounting standards (IAS) would be released together with the bank's consolidated results in mid April.
""We think that the profit under international standards will be similar, probably little lower, by 100 million (crowns) at the most,"" Ziegler told reporters.
The bank's balance sheet dipped to 359 billion crowns at the end of last year from 368 billion in 1995 on losses from exposure on the interbank market, and concentration on client loans, Ziegler said.
""We are happy with this result, it is a reflection of our strategy of a shift from the interbank market,"" he said. ""This year, we expect the balance sheet total to rise by eight percent.""
Last year Sporitelna, the former communist monolith where most Czechs kept personal deposits, cut its interbank market exposure to 28.4 percent of total assets from 40 percent in 1995, while loans to clients rose to 42.1 percent from 34.4.
Ziegler said net interest income dipped to 13.39 billion from 13.65 billion in 1995, while non-interest income rose to 4.26 from 3.99 billion.
He said profits should also rise this year, but declined to give more details of Sporitelna's financial plans.
The bank's gross profit was the same as the net result, as the bank paid no income tax.
In 1995 the gross profit was 9.31 billion crowns, but net earnings were dramatically lower after auditors forced Sporitelna to set aside 7.1 billion into reserves to cover exposure in doubtfull loans.
In the 1996, accounting period Sporitelna said it put aside 4.66 billion crowns for reserves. Klapal said this figure should decline to 3.1 billion in 1997.
Klapal also said Sporitelna was interested in converting more shares into global depository receipts, after last year's tranche of some seven percent underwritten by Bankers Trust.
The director said Sporitelna would close 500 small branches this year of the total number of 1,700, and lay off 2,000 employees of the current 18,709.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio, calculated under CNB practices, fell to 8.86 percent form 10.98, as a result of rising proportion of loans to clients which are covered from 100 percent in the domestic calculation as opposed to loans to banks which only need 20 percent, Ziegler said.
The proportion of classified loans rose to 24.72 percent from 20.86 percent, also due to the change in loan structure, Ziegler said.

JanLopatka,"CEZ a.s., the Czech Republic's main electricity generator, posted higher than expected 1996 profits on Friday, though company officials were not as optimistic about the company's bottom line this year.
CEZ said its preliminary 1996 net profit, calculated under international accounting standards, edged up to 9.7 billion crowns from 9.31 billion in 1995.
Under Czech accounting, which differs in areas such as interest payments, leasing payments and measuring profits and losses carried over from previous years, net profit dipped to 7.85 billion from 8.06 billion.
Petr Voboril, head of CEZ's planning department, said the result was slightly above the firm's expectations, adding that the company had funds to pay its first-ever dividend, expected to be between 30 and 45 crowns per share on the earnings.
""The profit is on the level where we expected, or little above that,"" Voboril told reporters and analysts.
Analysts too were encouraged by the figures and dividend announcement, though CEZ shares failed to immediately respond to the data, closing down five crowns at 1,055 on the Prague Stock Exchange.
""Based on IAS figures, the results were better than I expected...I expected about nine billion crowns so its slightly higher,"" said Miroslav Nosal, an analyst at Patria Finance.
""I expect the shares will respond favourably to the results and the fact that CEZ said dividends will be suggested to the shareholders at the AGM,"" he added.
CEZ officials have said several times that they would like to pay a dividend for 1996, but Voboril admitted the firm's majority shareholder, the state, may not be in favour of the move.
A spokeswoman at the minstry of industry and trade, which manages the state's 67 percent stake, told Reuters a final decision had yet to be made on whether the proposal would be approved.
""It's early for a final position. The ministry is considering the possibilities of dividend payments at CEZ and also the distribution companies,"" ministry spokeswoman Zuzana Fialova.
In addition, Voboril said the company expects 1997 profits to fall to the level of six billion this year as write-offs will increase.
He warned that the slow deregulation of energy prices and a less than desired price increase that CEZ may bill regional power distributors for electricity, as well as rising fuel prices and other costs, threatened to hit the company's perfomance in the future.
But he said that the company's creation of internal sources has been on and upward trend thanks to higher write-offs, despite profits falling under Czech standards, which are the basis for taxation and dividend payments.
Voboril said CEZ would tap international debt markets in the middle of this year with a bond issue, but declined to give more details.
In the results statement, prepared under international accounting standards, operating revenues grew by 9.4 percent last year to 55.4 billion, while operating expenses were up by 17.3 percent.
Earnings prior to tax fell 6.9 percent to 15.6 billion, but net profit rose due to a 20.8 percent decrease in tax payments, to 5.9 billion.
The company managed to increase its market share to 80 percent from 77 percent in 1995. Earnings per share rose to 180 crowns from 173, and return on equity fell to 10.4 percent from 11.1 percent.
Voboril said CEZ invested 22.3 billion crowns last year, and commissioned equipment worth 25 billion, including two hydroelectric power plants.

JanLopatka,"The Czech government gave its final approval on Wednesday to a 20-year contract for natural gas supplies from Norway, ending total dependence on Russian gas, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said.
""The government today gave its final approval to the Norwegian option of diversifying imports of natural gas including the diversification of the transport route,"" Dlouhy told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.
The deal, approved by Czech and Norwegian ministers last month, angered officials at Russia's gas company RAO Gazprom which called the move economically unjustified.
Financial details have not been disclosed, but the Norwegian gas is expected to cost more than Russian supplies.
A consortium of Norwegian firms, including Statoil, Norsk Hydro ASA and Saga Petroleum A/S, is involved in the deal, though Norway must still decide which gas producing platforms will supply the Czechs.
Under the deal which begins on May 1, supplies would start at 1.4 million cubic metres a day, increasing to about three billion cubic metres annually.
The total supply as laid out by the agreement should be 53 billion cubic metres (bcm) over 20 years.
The Norwegian gas is to be delivered through a pipeline via northern Germany which feeds into the Czech Republic.
Czechs, who for the past half century have taken all of their natural gas from Russia, now consume around nine bcm of gas per year. Total consumption is expected to rise to 12-13 bcm after the turn of the century.
Russia's Gazprom is still expected to remain the main supplier to the Czechs, but Gazprom officials said last month the Norwegian incursion could hurt Gazprom's competitive position in Europe.
""Gazprom is closely following the development of events in the Czech Republic, and remaining its fundamental partner in the field of gas supplies, will do everything possible to widen co-operation,"" Gazprom said.
Prague said it picked Norway after considering potential deals with German, Dutch and British suppliers, as well as a second delivery route of Russian gas.
The deal also signals an expected push in the sector by Norway into central and eastern Europe. Statoil officials said at an initialling of the agreement last month in Prague that it was also looking to supply Poland and Hungary with natural gas.

JanLopatka,"Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said on Thursday that a long-awaited Czech-German post-World War Two reconciliation treaty would not bring any change to laws which expelled millions of ethnic Germans.
Zieleniec told reporters he welcomed German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's statement on Wednesday that he hoped the sensitive document closing the book on the Nazi occupation of Czech lands and its aftermath would be signed by year's end.
But Zieleniec said there would be no tinkering with Prague's post-war laws which expelled and expropriated over 2.5 million ethnic Germans, known as Sudeten Germans, after the Czech lands were liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945.
""I want to say something clearly: the declaration will not at all mean not even a hint of a change of the Czech legal order,"" said Zieleniec.
""I am glad Mr. Chancellor spoke on this issue, it is a sign Czech-German relations are an important part of German political activity at present, and that these relations are in the focus of Germany's key politicians,"" he added.
Intensive bilateral talks on the declaration, now running for more than a year, have been held amid calls by politically powerful groups repesenting the expelled Germans for compensation from Prague.
The Czech government has given symbolic compensation to Czech victims of Nazi occupation, but the Bonn government has yet to offer compensation to the Czechs similar to payments made to victims of Nazism in other European countries.
The expelled Germans' groups, concentrated in southern Germany, have demanded the abolition of the post-war decrees issued by then-Czechoslovak President Edvard Benes.
Attempts to cancel the decrees by some individuals through Czech courts have failed.
Kohl pleaded for patience in his address to the Bundestag on Wednesday: ""We want to conclude this agreement this year,"" he said, adding that he wanted it to be symbolically crowned by a speech in Bonn by a representative of the Czech government.
After a meeting with ministers on Thursday Czech President Vaclav Havel, who has spearheaded Prague's warming of relations with Bonn despite holding a mostly ceremonial position, said he agreed with Kohl.
""There's nothing left but to say that it is good that Mr. Chancellor (Kohl) would like to have the declaration signed by the end of the year.""

JanLopatka,"Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s. said on Thursday it had agreed with Czech steelmaker Trinecke Zelezarny a.s. to cooperate in steel production and privatisation projects.
Skoda said the deal would help make the ailing Czech steel industry more efficient through coordinating the modernisation of production in complementary areas.
Skoda, which makes heavy iron finished and semi-finished goods, said in a statement from its headquarters in Plzen that both companies would specialise and coordinate in unspecified areas of production, aiming to cut costs.
Skoda's spokesman Karel Samec said selected products would be manufactured in the cheaper of the two mills.
""This scheme will also be used in the future in other companies,"" Samec said in a statement. ""Cooperation and... participation in privatisation is necessary, bearing in mind the current stagnation of the steel production in the world.""
Samec declined to specify which privatisation projects Skoda had under consideration.
The Industry and Trade Ministry plans to sell 19 percent stakes of the 67 percent it holds in two other steel firms -- Nova Hut a.s. and Vitkovice a.s.
The plan has yet to be approved by the full cabinet.
Trinecke Zelezarny, one of the four biggest steelmills located in the northeastern town of Trinec, was partially privatised through a direct sale of a 51 percent stake to a domestic investment group and the government's voucher scheme.
A steel industry source told Reuters on Thursday that Skoda, which has rapidly acquiried companies in the post-Communist era, was also considering acquiring the troubled Poldi Ocel steel mill west of Prague.
Skoda's Samec told Reuters he ""was not aware"" of any plans that would lead to Skoda acquisitions in Nova Hut or Vitkovice, and that ""it was too early to talk about other projects"".
The government in 1993 agreed to sell a controlling stake in Poldi to the small Czech company, Bohemia Art which has never fully paid for its majority interest.
Production in Poldi came to a halt earlier this year because the company was not able to pay its energy bills.
Skoda was involved in inconclusive talks earlier this year on bailing out Poldi. Bankruptcy cases against Poldi are slowly moving through the courts.
Skoda, based in the western city of Plzen, makes everything from drink cans to trolleybuses and nuclear components and has shown a large appetite for acquisitions. It is no longer affiliated with the car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s.

JanLopatka,"Engineering group Skoda a.s. said on Tuesday it had won an order to supply trolleybuses worth more than $170 million to the city of San Francisco, the largest order of Czech goods ever to the United States.
Skoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec said the electrically powered buses would be produced in the Czech Republic and assembled at Skoda's subsidiary, Electric Transit International (ETI) in Baltimore.
""We consider victory in this tender to be an extraordinary success not only in view of the expected volumes of supplies...but also because the U.S. market is among the most prestigious and demanding in the world,"" Hudec said.
Plzen-based Skoda, no longer affiliated with the Czech car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s., has made an aggressive push into new markets, aiming to offer western-quality units with the comparative cost advantage of eastern European production.
The San Francisco contract would open the way for Skoda, an engineering conglomerate which makes goods ranging from nuclear power components to drink cans, to win more business in the United States, Hudec said.
""Considering the ecologisation of public transport in the U.S., Skoda Plzen has real chances to win further orders... and also bring the brand Skoda to the U.S. market in relation to other production of our factories,"" he said.
ETI's president, Ladislav Tetal, told Reuters the order would virtually replace San Francisco's entire fleet of 300 buses, as the city retains only a few dozen younger units.
He said the deal had no connection with San Francisco's landmark cablecar lines which will continue to be a symbol of the ""City by the Bay"".
The total for the order with details of the financial and technical conditions would be finalised by mid-year, Hudec said, but declined to give further details.
The deal must still be approved by the San Francisco board of supervisors in a vote scheduled for April 22, ETI said.
Skoda has made over 12,000 trolleybuses since 1936 -- many of which can be seen running in cities throughout the former communist bloc.
Earlier this decade Skoda won a contract to supply 54 trolley buses to the city of Dayton, Ohio, and founded a U.S. joint venture with private partners in Baltimore, ETI, to assemble the buses. Skoda holds a majority stake in ETI.
The Dayton supply is scheduled to be completed in 1998. Skoda said it is also pursuing joint ventures to build trolley buses in Russia and Iran.
Guy Creasy, equities analyst at IB Austria Securities in Prague, said that while the San Francisco order was indeed a positive signal for Skoda shares, lingering questions over the cost of recent acquisitions remained.
""I don't think (the order) is a drop in the bucket, but I don't think it will make the difference between profit and loss,"" he said. ""I don't think it will make us change (Skoda's share recommendation) to a 'buy'.""
Creasy said that it was not yet clear how earnings from the order would be divided with Skoda's U.S. partners.
Analysts have been wary about Skoda shares, awaiting 1996 results which should show the impact of buying two ailing Czech truck makers, Liaz a.s. and Tatra a.s..
Skoda shares gained 25 crowns in Tuesday's fixing on the Prague Stock Exchange to 871 crowns, reversing a downtrend in the stock which ended 52 crowns lower on Monday. The shares showed thin activity after the Tuesday fixing.
Skoda said in a statement on Monday that it planned to raise its basic equity by 2.5 billion crowns through an unspecified share issue still to be decided by shareholders.
The Czech state National Property Fund (NPF) in March said it would sell its remaining 8.7 percent stake in Skoda soon through the Prague share markets.
News of the San Francisco order comes as the Czech Republic has posted record trade deficits. The country's current account deficit topped eight percent of gross domestic product last year, up from four percent in 1995.

The Dayton project is to be completed in 1998. Skoda said it is also pursuing joint ventures to build buses in Russian and Iran.
"
JanLopatka,"Engineering group Skoda a.s. said on Tuesday it had won an order to supply more than $170 million in trolleybuses to the city of San Francisco, the largest supply of Czech goods ever to the United States.
Skoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec said the electric-powered buses would be produced in the Czech Republic and assembled at Skoda's subsidiary, Electric Transit International (ETI) in Baltimore.
""We consider victory in this tender to be an extraordinary success not only in view of the expected volumes of supplies...but also because the U.S. market is among the most prestigious and demanding in the world,"" Hudec said.
Plzen-based Skoda, no longer affiliated with the Czech car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s., has made an aggressive push into new markets, aiming to offer western-quality units with the comparative cost advantage of eastern European production.
The San Francisco contract would open the way for Skoda, an engineering conglomerate which makes goods ranging from nuclear power components to drink cans, to win more business in the United States, Hudec said.
""Considering the ecologisation of public transport in the U.S., Skoda Plzen has real chances to win further orders... and also bring the brand Skoda to the U.S. market in relation to other production of our factories,"" he said.
Skoda has made over 12,000 trolleybuses since 1936 -- many of which can be seen running in cities throughout the former communist bloc.
Local Czech media reports quoted ETI officials as saying the San Francisco order could be for about 250 single-section and higher capacity buses through to the year 2000.
The total for the order with details of the financial and technical conditions would be finalised by mid-year, Hudec said, but declined to give further details.
Earlier this decade Skoda won a contract to supply 54 trolley buses to the city of Dayton, Ohio, and founded a U.S. joint venture with private partners in Baltimore, ETI, to assemble the buses. Skoda holds a majority stake in ETI.
The Dayton supply is scheduled to be completed in 1998. Skoda said it is also pursuing joint ventures to build trolley buses in Russian and Iran.
Guy Creasy, equities analyst at IB Austria Securities in Prague, said that while the San Francisco order was indeed a positive signal for Skoda shares, lingering questions over the cost of recent acquisitions remained.
""I don't think (the order) is a drop in the bucket, but I don't think it will make the difference between profit and loss,"" he said. ""I don't think it will make us change (Skoda's share recommendation) to a 'buy'.""
Creasy said that it was not yet clear how earnings from the order would be divided with Skoda's U.S. partners.
Analysts have been wary about Skoda shares, awaiting 1996 results which should show the impact of buying two ailing Czech truck makers, Liaz a.s. and Tatra a.s..
Skoda shares gained 25 crowns in Tuesday's fixing on the Prague Stock Exchange to 871 crowns, reversing a downtrend in the stock which ended 52 crowns lower on Monday. The shares showed thin activity after the Tuesday fixing.
Skoda said in a statement on Monday that it planned to raise its basic equity by 2.5 billion crowns through an unspecified share issue still to be decided by shareholders.
The Czech state National Property Fund (NPF) in March said it would sell its remaining 8.7 percent stake in Skoda soon through the Prague share markets.
News of the San Francisco order comes as the Czech Republic has posted record trade deficits. The country's current account deficit topped eight percent of gross domestic product last year, up from four percent in 1995.

JanLopatka,"The Czech Republic officially ended its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies on Monday, signing a final delivery contract with Norwegian suppliers Statoil, Saga Petroleum and Norsk Hydro.
Officials from Czech state monopoly gas importer Transgas and the Norwegian suppliers signed the deal which will see some 53 billion cubic metres of gas transported to the Czech Republic over the nex 20 years.
Transgas Director Miroslav Grec told a news conference after a signing ceremony that deals were also completed with transporters Netra GmbH and Verbundnetz Gas AG to ship the gas from a north-German terminal at Emden to the Czech border.
""The contract was signed for 20 years, and supplies will start as soon as in May this year,"" Grec said.
The signing of the contract officially and effectively ends the Czech Republic's dependence on natural gas supplies by Russia's Gazprom. Czechs currently consume slightly over nine billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas per year, with projections of demand rising to 13.8 bcm in 2010.
Grec said supplies this year would reach some 0.4 bcm, and gradually rise to three bcm annually by 2002.
Statoil Executive Vice-President Peter Mellbye said his company was now looking into other central and eastern European countries to build on its sucessfull penetration into the Czech market.
""Transgas is our first, and therefore a very important partner (in the region),"" Mellbye said.
The partners denied to disclose price terms of the agreements. Verbundnetz officials said its delivery contract was worth ""about 600 million marks"".
Grec said that the introduction of competition in supplies would improve the negotiating position for future deliveries from Russia or elsewhere. The Czech Republic's delivery contract with Gazprom ends in 1998.
The Czech Republic has already diversified crude oil and nuclear fuel supplies to win independence from Russian sources it had been exclusively tapping in the communist era.

JanLopatka,"U.S.-based Unisys Corp said on Tuesday it has appealed to the Czech Economic Competition Office a Defence Ministry decision awarding an army contract to a consortium of Electronic Data Systems and Digital Equipment Corp.
""Unisys submitted...a proposal for investigation of the decision of the Defence Minister of the Czech Republic,"" the company said in a statement.
Last week, Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny rejected a first round appeal by Unisys and IBM Corp saying he believed his decision in March to award a 1.3 billion crown army information system deal to EDS-Digital was correct.
Vyborny chose EDS-Digital despite a recommendation by a steering committee to chose Unisys's bid.
""By this step (the appeal), Unisys is continuing in its effort for recognition of its victory in the public tender...because it is convinced of the seriousness of its arguments,"" the statement said.
Vyborny has said that he decided in favour of EDS-Digital due to the lower price of its bid. Unisys has said that price was not weighted in accordance with the tender rules, and that EDS-Digital's offer was not complete. EDS declined to comment.
Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender last year, but it was cancelled in August when competition authorities found irregularities in the process.
Vyborny said after the second tender that the ministry had decided to ignore the recommendation of the tender committee also because some members's evaluations were far different than the rest of the committee.
Unisys has said it was suspicious that the original tender was abolished and rankings were changed when it won again.
""Unisys is proposing cancellation of the decision and hopes the government of the Czech Republic will deal with the situation around this strategic order,"" Unisys added.
A number of other Czech military tenders have been marked by controversy, sometimes including allegations of graft.
Installation of the staff information system is seen as a large step on the Czech army's path to compatibility with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's military command.
NATO leaders will decide in July which former communist countries will be invited to join the alliance. The Czech Republic is a front runner along with Poland and Hungary.

JanLopatka,"The Czech government announced a sweeping series of economic measures to jump start the economy on Wednesday, but admitted that even with the moves, GDP growth would slump badly in 1997.
In releasing the 11 page plan late Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said cuts of almost five percent to budget expenditures, limits on public sector wage growth and a speeding up of privatisation would affect almost every Czech.
He said the measures are aimed not only at improving the economy, but also ""the completion of the concept of the transformation of the Czech economy.""
""Therefore it must be a very complex combination of individual measures, but also of explicit change of the original objectives of the government's policy,"" he said.
But Klaus told reporters that even with the measures, he would consider it a ""success"" if 1997 GDP growth reached half of the 5.4 percent, year-on-year growth rate forecast in the budget.
While the statement said monetary policy was not mentioned in the document because this area is for the central bank to decide, it nonetheless chided the central bank for its tight monetary policy.
""There must be an inverse development in monetary and fiscal policy,"" the statement said. ""Monetary policy, after the restriction in middle of the last year...(it) must make a move in the opposite direction,"" it said.
Added Klaus: ""There is an argument... That the state does not consider it rational to strive to alter the exchange rate. We are not altering the central parity of the crown and we are convinced that the fluctuation band plus and minus 7.5 per cent is fully sufficient.""
The crown is fixed daily by the central bank at +/- 7.5 percent of the mid-point of its dollar/mark basket.
The Czech economy has enjoyed several years of demand-led growth as industry imported technology and a sharp rise in wages provoked a consumer boom.
But industrial and construction output have both declined for two consecutive months and the burgeoning trade deficit, at a record 160.3 billion crowns in 1996, has shown no signs of letting up.
The government measures include:
*Some 25.5 billion crowns cuts in budget expenditure, originally approved at 549.1 billion crowns.
*A limiting of public sector wage growth to 7.3 percent, from an originally-planned 11.9 percent.
*A speeding up of privatisation, including banks.
*Tightening of capital market regulation, including the setting up of an independent watchdog and the separation of investment and commercial banking.
*Implementation of an import deposit programme forcing importers to place a still to be determined percent of the value of imports on interest-free deposit at the central bank.
The government also said it would propose a lowering of the corporate tax rate in 1998 to 35 percent from 39 percent this year, but some excise taxes would rise to help boost revenues.
"
JanLopatka,"A Czech cabinet decision to require deposits on consumer goods imports will be less harmful for inflation than the rejected option of import surcharges but may have little impact on the trade deficit, analysts said on Friday.
But they praised a government plan, revealed on Wednesday as part of an economic revival package, to cut public sector wage growth to 7.3 percent this year from the planned 11.9 percent, saying this would be more effective in pushing down demand for imported products than the deposit programme.
The analysts polled by Reuters said the deposit programme, which will come into effect on Monday, would not have a great impact on consumer prices.
Under the deposit scheme, importers will be required to deposit 20 percent of the value of imported consumer goods on an interest-free account for 180 days.
The commercial banks will channel the money from their branches to state-held development bank Konsolidacni Banka.
Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, officially announcing the new measure on Friday, said he hoped the restriction would reverse the trend of the widening trade deficit, but did not make a more specific forecast.
""Deposits are a better way than an import surcharge, which would raise inflation, and import quotas, which would be unwelcome internationally,"" said ING Barings analyst Boris Gomez.
He saw little impact on the trade deficit from the deposit scheme but added that imports could fall as a result of a decline in domestic demand caused by lower wage growth.
""I believe that the government will be able to go ahead with the wage restrictions. The question is whether the private sector will follow,"" Gomez said.
Minister Dlouhy said the deposits would apply to some 30 percent of imports, including selected foodstuffs, cars, electronics, textile products, furniture, and appliances.
Vladimir Kreidl of investment bank Patria Finance said the wage growth limits were ""very drastic and ambitious"" and said staff were likely to be laid off in order to meet the target.
""If well implemented, the measures should benefit the economy...The trade deficit should be reduced by 30-50 billion crowns from the originally expected 200-220 billion (1997 deficit),"" Kreidl said.
The trade gap rose to 160.3 billion crowns last year from under 100 billion in 1995, and official estimates before imposition of the import deposits were projecting this year's deficit to range around 210 bilion.
But Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka said the import deposits would have virtually no impact on the trade balance.
""I am leaving my prediction (of the foreign trade deficit) unchanged at 180 billion,"" he said, addding that a major change could come only through a change of the exchange rate policy.
Analysts said the programme would have minimal impact on inflation, which fell to 6.8 percent year on year in March.
""The effect in the cost of imported goods would be a year-on-year increase in inflation of about 0.3-0.4 percent,"" said Jack Schrantz, head of research at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment in Prague.
""But this will be offset by other factors such as decreased government spending and a slowdown in the economy,"" he added.
Other measures taken by the cabinet include 25.5 billion in budget cuts, setting up an independent capital market oversight body, promoting exports, and fighting more intensively against economic crime.
The package also calls for speeding up privatisation of state-held companies, relaxation of monetary policy, and separation of banks' investment and commercial arms.

JanLopatka,"Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky said media reaction to the failure of Kreditni Banka a.s. last month temporarily destabilised the banking sector, but it is basically sound.
After closed-door testimony to a parliamentary banking commission, Tosovsky told reporters the system -- especially the four largest banks where most activity is centred -- is on a firm footing after a period of consolidation.
""It sounds parodoxical at the present time when its credibility is declining, but the banking sector is in very good health,"" Tosovsky said.
""The four biggest banks have a market value of about 110 billion crowns, while in 1990 they had a negative value... these banks represent more than 70 percent of the sector.""
The governor said the public uproar after the collapse of the medium-sized Plzen-based Kreditni Banka last month led to a decline in confidence in Czech banks, but he blamed the media and politicians for this.
He said the collapse caused a liquidity crunch in the system, but he declined to say which banks, if any, were threatened by the reaction.
""We rather consider it as a liquidity problem than anything else, but I obviously cannot give information about any concrete banks,"" he said.
Kreditni was the 11th bank to need help from the central bank, which tightened its oversight of operations in a move to consolidate the country's banking sector.
But the case of Kreditni, whose estimated losses totalled nearly 12 billion crowns, was followed by reports in local media that larger banks might be in trouble.
One report in the weekly Respekt claimed Agrobanka a.s., the largest fully private bank, had been ignored by the interbank lending market and was suffering liquidity problems.
The bank has yet to comment publicly on the report.
Then the chairman of parliament Milos Zeman, who leads the opposition Social Democrats, claimed in a television discussion programme that the largest savings bank Ceska Sporitelna a.s. had unspecified problems.
The bank strongly denied this, and said Zeman's remarks led to unusually high withdrawals in the following days.
Tosovsky said the CNB was prepared ""to function as the last resort creditor, in certain moments -- above all if there is a liquidity problem.""
Tosovsky, who sits on a select government committee investigating Kreditni's failure, said he would support a separate parliamentary commission probing the subject as well.
He said that after a three-year moratorium on granting new banking licences ended earlier this year with the CNB's awarding of two licences to a German and a British bank, the central bank might consider other candidates.
""We do not intend to seal off the market hermetically, so we are looking for a policy of something in between... and give a chance to quality institutions,"" Tosovsky said.

JanLopatka,"Pope John Paul arrived in Prague on Friday, saying he hoped his visit to the Czech Republic would bring a new step forward in the spiritual growth of all Czechs.
The 76-year old Pontiff, on his third visit to Prague since the fall of communism in 1989, was greeted at the airport by President Vaclav Havel and other Czech political and religious leaders.
Some 200 schoolchildren waved yellow and white Vatican flags as the Pope slowly descended the aircraft steps and shook Havel's hand before touching a bowl of Czech earth.
Pope John Paul said in a speech he hoped his visit would help bring about ""a fresh step forward in the ever-increasing spiritual and ethical growth"" of all Czechs.
He paid tribute to Havel, a former dissident playwright who spent several years in jail under communism, as being ""among those who brought about the rebirth of this country"".
The Pope is in the Czech Republic chiefly to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the death of St Adalbert, the first Czech bishop who also took the gospel to Poland.
Adalbert, or Vojtech in Czech, is seen by Catholics as a figure of spiritual significance for Europeans of all denominations.
""I am certain that the heritage of Christian values of which St Adalbert was a special witness in times marked by ignorance and cruelty will not leave indifferent those who, although far from belief, have at heart the civil, cultural and spiritual roots which have so profoundly marked the history of your homeland,"" the Pope said.
He also paid tribute to late Czech Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, who for 40 years championed religious freedom in communist Czechoslovakia and died in 1992.
""He will certainly be rejoicing in heaven to see me return among his people...History is truly guided by the almighty hand of God,"" he said.
Havel said in his speech that Adalbert cherished a dream of European spiritual unity and saw his Czech homeland as part of the Christian community of the continent.
""This community was to be based on a spiritual and moral renewal and on readiness to embrace common values -- which is needed today just as it was then,"" Havel said.
The president said the martyred saint had left a legacy of peace, integration and unity which was shared by the many European nations commemorating his millennium.
The Pope's last visit to the Czech Republic, in May 1995, proved controversial when he canonised Jan Sarkander, tortured to death by Protestants in 1620. Some Protestants say Sarkander was a traitor who encouraged a Catholic invasion.
But Havel said Adalbert's tradition did not divide Czechs among themselves or with others.
""It unites our people across denominations and serves as a bridge linking us with our Central European neighbours as well as with other nations,"" he said.
The Pope, whose health has been fragile in recent years, walked slowly but unassisted and stood to deliver his speech.
He is to mark Adalbert's death with a mass for young people in the town of Hradec Kralove, some 100 km (60 miles) from Prague, on Saturday and hold another open air mass and an ecumenical service in the capital on Sunday.

JanLopatka,"Czech power utility CEZ a.s. on Wednesday reported lower first half profits as the effects of a prolonged battle over price agreements with regional distributors took a bite out of its bottom line.
Despite an unusually long winter that boosted first half revenues, company officials told a news conference that net profit, according to international accounting standards, eased to 5.95 billion crowns from 6.26 billion in the previous year.
They added the firm's net profit calculated according to Czech accounting standards fell year-on-year to 5.1 billion in the first half from 5.57 billion crowns.
CEZ, the country's largest firm in terms of revenues, and six out of the country's eight regional power distributors have been at odds for months over the terms of long-term supply agreements, and have been fighting over prices since last year.
CEZ's Petr Voboril said that in the first quarter, CEZ charged 1,020 crowns and last year's average price of 1,033 crowns per megawatthour as deposit payments in the second quarter while the agreements are sorted out, but even that wasn't enough to keep profits from slipping.
""Most of the distributors do not even pay the full provisional price. At the end of the first half they owed us almost two billion crowns,"" said Voboril, director of CEZ's planning and financial analysis department.
He told reporters that the drop would have been sharper if it was not partially covered by higher-than-planned energy sales due to the long winter.
CEZ operating revenues, according to international standards, rose to 28.51 billion crowns from 26.09 billion as the company raised its market share to 79.8 percent from 76.3 percent.
The firm still plans to post flat profit for the entire year, and to pay its first-ever dividend of 3.3 percent of the 1,000 crown nominal value of its shares, Voboril said.
CEZ posted an international standard 9.3 billion crown 1995 net profit, and an 8.1 billion crown Czech accounting net profit.
Until this year, CEZ has re-invested all earnings into its extensive desulphurisation programme and the construction of a nuclear power plant at Temelin.
CEZ shares dipped two crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange on Wednesday to 1,043 crowns, with most analysts saying the market had already discounted the lower profit figure.
But warned Jan Sykora, a broker with Prague's Wood and Company: ""There are still many unclear things. CEZ, despite the increase of market share, will rather lose its positions.""

JimGilchrist,"Illegal mobile phone use across the Chinese border is continuing to interrupt air traffic control communications with airline pilots flying in and out of Hong Kong but cross-border action to try and solve the problem appears to be working, industry sources told Reuters.
The Hong Kong Aircrew Officers' Association said Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a persistent problem with pilots complaining of a loud buzzing in their ears which forces them to quickly change to another frequency to maintain contact with air traffic control.
Hong Kong's Kai Tak is already regarded as one of the world's most difficult airports to land at, and the sources say RFI is an unwelcome addition to a pilot's workload. RFI is widely blamed on mobile phones and pagers being used on illegal frequencies in neighbouring Guangdong province.
One Hong Kong-based Boeing 747 freighter pilot, who did not want to be identified, said the problem caused safety concerns.
""It happened to me the other day just after take-off. But the interference is not consistent and they seem to have a problem in tracking it down. It means we sometimes get incomplete radio messages which causes a headache when you least need it. It takes time to change to the back-up frequency and at peak times the airwaves are very crowded. I know of quite a few captains who have filed an occurrence report because of the safety issue involved,"" he said.
The aircrew officers' association general secretary, John Findlay, agreed RFI was a concern but said remedial action appeared to be working.
""It has been a problem but pilots I've been speaking to say the situation has very much improved recently,"" he said.
In a statement, the Hong Kong government's Civil Aviation Department said RFI had been under ""urgent investigation"" by the territory's Office of Telecommunications Authority (OFTA) which had been liaising with the relevant authorities in China.
""It is understood that a team has been established in China to tackle the RFI issue. It appears recently that the extent of RFI has been reduced and the situation is being closely monitored. With assistance from the Chinese authorities, it is anticipated that the RFI problem could eventually be eliminated,"" the statement said.
The department also said it had deployed spare back-up frequencies as interim replacements when RFI occurred and until the effect on air traffic operations was overcome.
OFTA said in a statement it expected its counterpart in China, the Guangdong Radio Management Committee Office, to take urgent action to remove the interference, and that some channels had already been cleared.

JimGilchrist,"Cathay Pacific and the Hong Kong government's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) are at odds on the reason for delays at Hong Kong's Kai Tak's airport.
Cathay time performance manager Peter Li blames  delays on Cathay's increasingly congested home airport and ""air traffic control"" - a charge rejected by Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) which told Reuters congestion and not air traffic control was the true cause.
Cathay which is one of the main users of Kai Tak defines a delay as more than 15 minutes after scheduled arrival or departure. Departure delays rose in 1996 rose to 61 percent of flights from Hong Kong compared to 48 percent in 1995 with arrivals similarly affected, Li said in the airlines in-house newspaper.
Cathay does not publish more details on the extent or number of delays.
Other airlines which also fly into Hong Kong are also frustrated by Kai Tak's constraints which cannot be overcome until its new airport at Chek Lap Kok is due to open in 15 months time, industry sources said.
""In addition to these factors we have to fight against constraints such as slot availability, tight crew scheduling, high fleet utilisation, new products, new routes and new engines on new fleet,"" Li said.
He said action has been taken at both managerial and operational level to meet the on time performance target including reviewing routes to support re-design of better schedules.
CAD said delays are bound to occur when demand exceeds capacity and when aircraft are bunched together. It added the reason for the apparent increase in delays suggested by Cathay's statistics can be explained by the way delays are defined by the airlines. Because Kai Tak has limited apron space, aircraft occasionally have to be held in their parking bays which counts as a delay unlike at other busy airports, the CAD said.
The CAD has been actively reviewing ways of enhancing capacity to handle ever increasing demand, the CAD statement added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

JimGilchrist,"Hong Kong's air cargo workers are to pioneer a ""unique"" computerised rota system later this year, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) deputy managing director Yueng Kwok Keung said.
The new system should enable HACTL to further improve its air cargo handling efficiency, Yueng told Reuters in an interview.
""It's a pretty unique system which we're helping to develop and is likely to be delivered to us in the middle of this year. We're expected to be the first to use it,"" Yueng said.
When introduced, HACTL's 2,000 employees will be able to have a big say on which shifts they work, who they work alongside and which days off they can have.
Rostering is a particularly difficult problem in the air cargo industry which, despite high automation, relies on intensive labour where workloads change from day to day, he added.
""The new system is democratic where every worker is given a set number of points so he can bid to have a certain day off for his wife's birthday or if he wants to work nights or whatever. It can also help with team formation,"" Yueng explained.
The rostering system is the result of a joint venture between business and academia. Funded by the Hong Kong government, research has been carried out at Hong Kong's Chinese University for the past year with HACTL computer experts closely involved, he added.
Yueng said he thinks the new system can be adapted in other industries with complicated work patterns. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017

JimGilchrist,"Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) said it set four new handling records during the territory's pre-Christmas peak season in December.
HACTL managing director Anthony Charter told Reuters that imports were especially strong when new daily, weekly and monthly records were set.
A new daily import handling record of 2,661 tonnes was set on December 26, according to HACTL's performance records.
""The daily tonnage record (for the after Christmas) is most unusual. Imports into China have been very strong, noticeably machinery,"" Charter said.
A new weekly import record of 15,720 tonnes was also recorded between December 16 and 22.
December as a whole was also a record month for imports with 67,572 tonnes landing at Kai Tak airport.
December 15 also saw a new daily record being set for both imports and exports combined of 5,788 tonnes, HACTL figures show.
Charter said HACTL's long range forecast is for 8 per cent growth this year and he personally thinks it may reach 10 per cent.
""We have all been surprised by the trends of the last three or four months and there is not much to indicate a slowdown for the next six months,"" Charter added.
HACTL, which has a monopoly on all air cargo handling at Kai Tak airport, is jointly owned by Swire Aviation Ltd, Jardine Matheson, Wharf (Holdings) Ltd, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, China National Aviation Corp and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

JimGilchrist,"Martinair has begun its ""historic"" freighter service between Guangzhou and Amsterdam, the Dutch airline's Far East general manager, Walter Tseng said.
Tseng told Reuters in an interview, that he expects the new service will be slowly built up after initial flights on December 20 and 29.
""The first two flights were a combination of local cargo supported by cargo from Hong Kong and topped up in Bangkok so it was shared by three hubs which we are using to slowly build up the Guangzhou service.""
""You have to remember Guangzhou is nothing compared to Hong Kong which is the traditional entry point. Because we have such strong competition from Hong Kong it takes a little time to convince shippers. In China the main problem is the red tape and documentation but they picking it up very fast,"" Tseng added.
The Dutch cargo carrier became the first European airline to be allowed to fly scheduled services into the southern Chinese city after twice being postponed in October and November because of ""licensing and equipment"" delays.
After a New Year holiday suspension, Martinair said it will begin a regular scheduled service proper on January 23 and every Friday after that. Also as a result of lengthy Government negotiations, Guangzhou based China Southern Airlines won permission to begin its first European service to Amsterdam.
Martinair, which earlier described the new Boeing 747-200 link via Bangkok and Abu Dhabi as a ""historic"" new link said it aims to capture a profitable portion of the air cargo market to Europe from the booming Pearl River delta region of southern China. Up to now most European bound air cargo from southern China is trucked over the border and flown from Hong Kong. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

JimGilchrist,"EVA Air is planning to start a new freighter service from Taipei to Brussels later this year, airline spokesman K. W. Nieh has told Reuters.
At the same time, the Taiwanese carrier is also planning to replace its McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter service from Taipei to Amsterdam via Dubai with an MD-11 Combi aircraft, Nieh said in an interview.
""We propose the new MD-11 freighter service to Brussels starting in May or June using the aircraft that is being replaced by the Combi aircraft on the Amsterdam service,"" Nieh said.
In a further expansion of its cargo business, EVA will also take delivery of two more McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighters by the end of this year, along with the first of two new Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft, bringing EVA's all MD-11 freighter fleet to five. EVA's current fleet of 28 aircraft is due to rise to 34 by next year with the two MD-11 freighters and two 747-400 purchases along with two McDonnell Douglas MD-90 shorthaul passenger twinjets, Nieh added.
He said the new freighters will be used to expand cargo revenue which is already expected to be more than 35 per cent of the airline's total revenue when last year's financial figures are published in March.
EVA has not yet chosen which routes the two new freighters will operate on but Chicago is a possibility to supplement existing freighter services to New York and Seattle. EVA also operates Combi flights into Los Angeles and San Francisco, Nieh added.
""We hope we can use our new freighters to the United States but it depends on traffic rights and government negotiations regarding America's open skies policy. We hope an agreement can be reached later this year, once that happens we could apply for Chicago,"" Nieh said.
EVA has no plans to start a dedicated freighter service from the Taiwanese capital to Hong Kong which is now served by 16 passenger flights a week partly using Combi aircraft, the spokesman added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

JimGilchrist,"Cargo airlines may fly elsewhere if the cost of using Hong Kong's new airport is dramatically increased, the Orient Airlines Association (OAA) director-general Richard Stirland said.
Stirland, speaking from Manila, told Reuters he is alarmed at reports that charges may double when Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok replaces Kai Tak in 1998.
The OAA  represents 16 of the major carriers in Asia including Singapore Airlines Ltd, Japan Airlines Co Ltd, Thai Airways International Ltd and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd,
Stirland said some airlines - especially cargo carriers - may bypass Hong Kong for cheaper alternatives nearby such as Macau, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
""You may get a situation as in Europe where freighter operators don't need to go to Heathrow or Paris-Charles de Gaulle and use smaller, cheaper alternatives instead,"" he added.
It currently costs around US$24,000 for a two hour stop in Hong Kong compared to $23,000 at Singapore's Changi, he said.
The new Hong Kong Airport Authority has said charges will ""inevitably rise"" but added that reports that they will double are ""pure speculation.""
A spokeswoman said it will not be until early next year how that a decision will be taken on how much it will cost after the airlines have been consulted.
The charges will then have to be approved by Hong Kong's Director of Civil Aviation.
A spokesman for one of the major users of the new airport, Hong Kong's de facto flag carrier Cathay Pacific said it is concerned at price rises which would have to be passed on to airline passengers and cargo customers.
""There is a big concern about fees rising which would damage all airlines and Hong Kong as a regional hub. Ultimately we could not absorb that sort of increase which would be passed onto our customers,"" Kwan Chuk-fai said.
""We will be seeking a meeting with the authority but so far no date has been fixed,"" he added. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017

JimGilchrist,"Major airlines including Lufthansa Cargo and Air France Cargo have raised their ex-Hong Kong air cargo market rates to European destinations by HK$1 per kilo, industry sources told Reuters.
The rate rise from January 1 is in addition to the controversial 80 HK cents a kilo fuel surcharge which some airlines imposed before Christmas, to cover big increases in aviation fuel costs.
The surcharge issue led to a protest by the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, which also represents the territory's air freight forwarders. The council lobbied the Hong Kong government's Civil Aviation Department to declare the surcharge illegal and, after warning letters were issued, some airlines quickly agreed to withdraw the fuel surcharge but raise market rates instead.
These airlines have increased ex-Hong Kong rates by HK$1.80 per kilo and include Alitalia, Emirates, Cargolux, Virgin Atlantic Martinair, Swissair and Air Hong Kong
Lufthansa Cargo, which had refused to withdraw its surcharge, raised its rate by HK$1 from January 1 and is also maintaining a separate 80 cents surcharge imposed before Christmas, according to an airline source. ....""We have informed the agents that we will increase our rates by one dollar and the 80 cents fuel fee or surcharge will be maintained but no longer shown on the airway bill which we think should solve the problem,"" the source said.
One of the leading advocates of a surcharge, Air France Cargo, raised its market rate by HK$1 from January 1 and is continuing with its 80 HK cents fuel surcharge, the airline's Hong Kong regional manager Philippe Bour told Reuters.
""The bottom line is the same with a HK$1.80 rise but we respect our commitment and have to be fair to our customers. As soon as the fuel price drops then we will cancel the fuel surcharge,"" Bour said.
Hong Kong's home carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways Limited which did not impose any fuel surcharge, raised its rate by HK$1.50 from January 1, the airline's general manager cargo, James Barrington said.
One airline cargo manager, who asked not to be named, said the fuel surcharge issue was a ""very touchy subject"" but it was not worth provoking more confrontation with the Hong Kong government.
Sam Chung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents, which represents more than 260 of the territory's agents, said all major airlines had raised rates apparently in anticipation of heavy demand before Chinese new year early next month.
""The fuel surcharge which we thought was illegal has gone and the airlines have raised their rates instead which we can't argue about.""
British Airways, a major cargo carrier to Europe with twice daily passenger flights and dedicated freighter flights, said it would ""wait and see"" before deciding on any rate rise.

JimGilchrist,"Cathay Pacific Airways Limited said its Boeing 747-400 freighters will become the world's first cargo aircraft to utilise Future Air Navigation System (FANS) routes expected to be pioneered by the Hong Kong airline later this year.
""We are leaders in this field and we have the first FANS equipped cargo aircraft. They are ready and waiting for the go ahead on any routes that are available,"" Cathay's international operations manager, Paul Horsting told journalists.
The revolutionary air traffic control system allows aircraft to use Global Positioning System (GPS)satellite navigation instead of radar ground stations for more direct routings and more efficient use of airspace. Airlines expect major benefits such as shorter flight times, reduced fuel costs and greater payloads.
Explaining how Cathay is exploiting the FANS technology potential, he said 18 of the carrier's 21 Boeing 747-400s, including two freighters, have been fitted with Communications Navigation/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) equipment.
Cathay's entire 747-400 fleet is expected to be fully fitted by March and investigations are underway to fit the airline's Airbus A340-300 long range aircraft too. All 747-400 cockpit crew have already undergone training, he said.
Cathay has been one of the ""gang of four"" airlines - along with United Airlines, Air New Zealand and Qantas - which has pioneered the development of FANS technology and been conducting trials in the North Pacific.
Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department has given engineering approval to the new system and operational approval is ""imminent,"" Cathay said. The Hong Kong government has also invested in FANS ground equipment which allows air traffic control messages to relayed to pilots via datalink instead of by voice.
Los Angeles to Hong Kong is expected to be the first FANS approved route later this year with others to European destinations expected around the same time or early next year.
Horsting said it was difficult to detail how much Cathay has invested in the new technology either in total or cost per aircraft.
""The saving is not just on navigation and more direct routes for aircraft. Passengers also get much better benefits by being able to use satellite phones and faxes. There is a saving otherwise we would not be doing it but it is very hard to quantify,"" Horsting said. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax 5017

JimGilchrist,"Cathay Pacific Airways Limited said it welcomed the go- ahead for a second runway at Manchester airport.

JimGilchrist,"British Airways World Cargo raised ex-Hong Kong market rates by HK$1.50 per kilo from January one to compensate for higher fuel prices, BA's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan said.
BA was the only airline not to get involved in the controversy over a fuel surcharge late last year, he added. Then when freight forwarders' complained over fuel surcharges, most carriers operating European services raised ex-Hong Kong market rates on January 1 by HK$1 a kilo instead.
However, when asked in the second week of January if BA would also be raising rates in line with its competitors, a senior BA official in Hong Kong had said the airline would ""wait and see.""
Chan said BA's HK$1.50 market rate rise was imposed on January 1 and followed a 50 HK cents rise on November 1 because of rising fuel prices.
Customer resistance to any price rise was ""inevitable"" but customers were realising how hard fuel prices have hit airlines, he noted.
Chan said despite the increase, current demand was strong with BA's three times a week wet lease freighter service to London Gatwick operating at full capacity. -- Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

JimGilchrist,"The decision by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd to buy three more Airbus Industrie A340 long range aircraft will increase the airline's air cargo opportunities, according to a senior Cathay cargo executive.
Ray Jewell, cargo marketing and sales manager for Cathay Pacific Cargo, told Reuters in an interview that the new aircraft will be able to fly between 15 and 17 tonnes of belly space cargo plus passengers in normal weather conditions from Hong Kong to Toronto.
Other possible destinations for the new aircraft from Hong Kong to Europe are still being studied, he added. The A340's ability to fly ultra-long distances will mean some existing routes become non stop destinations, Jewell said.
""These new aircraft will certainly help us on the air cargo side of things, there is no question about that. We are very pleased with our existing A340s which are very cargo friendly and fuel-efficient along with our Boeing 777s,"" Jewell said.
Cathay currently have four A340-200 and three A340-300 in its fleet.
The new Airbus A340-300 models are due to be delivered in the second and third quarters of 1998 to coincide with the opening of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok and increased flight schedules.
""Chek Lap Kok will definitely open things up for us and for other airlines which at the moment are restricted for slots at Kai Tak. The new airport is a major factor in planning and strategy. The increased cargo opportunities go hand in hand,"" Jewell added.

JimGilchrist,"British Airways World Cargo plans to increase its wet lease freighter service between Hong Kong and London to a daily frequency when the territory's new airport opens next year, the airline's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan, has told Reuters.
BA is also planning to step up its three times a week freighter link from Hong Kong to London Gatwick to four times weekly later this year, Chan said in an interview.
It now operates Boeing 747-200 freighters wet leased from Atlas Air in addition to sizeable belly capacity aboard 14 Boeing 747-400 passenger flights a week to Heathrow.
Wet leasing involves the supply of an aircraft with crew, fuel, supplies and supporting services.
The proposed daily freighter service from Hong Kong could be switched to Heathrow where BA is building a new dedicated terminal provided suitable slots become available, Chan added.
""We are hoping to start the fourth weekly frequency late this summer and a daily service from next year as we continue to expand. Three years ago we started with zero now we have three freighters a week with the prospect of more to come,"" Chan said.
BA said it currently enjoys a 12 percent market share of shipments from Hong Kong to Europe and 45 per cent to the UK and Ireland.

JimGilchrist,"A Hong Kong government aircraft is to be the first to land at the territory's new Chek Lap Kok airport next month, a Civil Aviation Department spokesman told Reuters.
A Beechcraft Super King 200, belonging to the Government Flying Service, and normally used for search and rescue missions, is due to make the maiden landing on February 20, the spokesman said.
Initial reports said two American pilots flying a U.S. government Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) jet used to test the new airport's navigation instruments would be the first to land on the newly completed 3,800 metre long and sixty metres wide southern runway.
But for ""ceremonial"" reasons the spokesman said the honour will be given to Hong Kong government pilots watched by invited guests and the media.
""The first landing will be an important milestone in the airport's history,"" the spokesman said.
After the first flight, the specialised FAA aircraft is expected to start a test and calibration programme of the new airport's Instrument Landing System and navigation aids to prepare for the airport's opening in April next year, the spokesman added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017

JimGilchrist,"Some airlines and freight forwarders say they anticipate a traditional mini-boom in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holiday starting on February 6, and despite space being available, rates are firmer than might be expected, a Reuters survey shows.
But industry sources also generally expect trans-Pacific rates to stay flat for the next couple of months.
Following what was reported to be one of the busiest pre-Christmas peak periods seen in Hong Kong for many years, the start of 1997 has seen the trans-Pacific air cargo market slump back into familiar January doldrums.
But both airlines and freight forwarders say they are pleased to report that last year's ""disastrous"" January, which many said was the worst they had ever experienced, has not been repeated.
Industry spokesmen said many factories in China which airfreight their finished goods out of Hong Kong are awaiting a new round of export licences. As soon as they are granted in the next few days, both airlines and freight forwarders expect a rush from manufacturers anxious to complete shipments before factory production comes to a virtual standtill for the two week long holiday or more.
More than one freight forwarder complained that, despite the seasonal drop in demand, cargo rates have not dropped as much as had been expected.
One well known freight forwarder in the territory said airlines are unusually keen to do deals on rates which indicated they have space to fill. He was happy doing business for a 35 tonne shipment to Los Angeles earlier this week which cost around HK$15 per kilo.
""Airlines which never normally do deals are very keen this month which indicates there is spare capacity around,"" he said.
""The market is reasonably busy and there is quite a bit of freight around,"" he added.
Yoichi Tanaka managing director of freight forwarding firm Kintetsu World Express (HK) Ltd said despite a softening of demand, ex-HK rates to Japan were being deliberately held firm by airlines ""who think they can still make money from the current market.""
""The market has seen its normal slow down both to Japan and trans-Pac compared with the peak season. Overall, for both air freight exports and imports, the market is better than last January,"" said Tanaka who is ""optimistically"" forecasting four to five cent growth over the next six months.
Yang Seung Joo, general manager for Korean Airlines Cargo in Hong Kong, was one airline executive who said that he was keen to maintain rate levels.
""We are trying to keep our prices as high as they were at the end of the year (during peak season). This year we will keep prices for all destinations a little bit higher than last year to protect our interests,"" he said.
KAL has three freighters a week - two Boeing 747s and one Airbus A300 - from Hong Kong to Seoul plus a joint venture flight with Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.
Yang said demand was slack but business this year is better than last January which was the ""worst"" he had ever known. He ""cautiously"" expects this year to be better than last.
Strike action in South Korea had not caused any disruption to KAL's cargo flights, Yang said.
Another key player on Japanese and trans-Pacific routes, Cathay Pacific said the market had ""softened"" but was still ""healthy"". Compared with Cathay's cargo services to Europe, the west-bound market was not as strong, Cathay Cargo's marketing and sales manager Ray Jewell said.
""We are pretty optimistic about trans-Pacific which finished the year very strongly and the fact that the market has now weakened is nothing unusual. What is unusual is the European market staying so bouyant. Overall we are looking pretty good for the start of the year,"" he said
Cathay said there will undoubtedly be a pre-Chinese New Year boom in business but any indication of how strong the market really is will not really be known until after the holiday
David Sung, Hong Kong sales manager for Polar Air Cargo, which operates only trans-Pacific services from Hong Kong to Chicago, Colombus and New York, said the market had followed its traditional pattern and slumped after early January. Flights have been cancelled because of lack of demand.
But he said he was hopeful of a ""mini-peak season"" in the coming fortnight as factories in China rush to dispatch orders.
""The market is slowly picking up after being dead slow right after western new year. Chinese New Year is coming soon this year in early February and we expect a rush next week when we will operate a full schedule of five flights a week and are ready to put on additional flights if needed because we have aircraft available,"" Sung said.
He did not anticipate a rise in trans-Pacific rates in the lead-up to Chinese New Year.
A spokesman for All Nippon Airlines Co Ltd and its subsidiary Nippon Cargo Airlines (NCA) was also anticipating a rush before Chinese New Year as mainly garment manufacturers in China are awarded export licences.
""I think the market will pick up next week as manufacturers hurry to get their orders out. Last January was terrible but this year it is better and we expect a rush,"" the spokesman said.
He also said the outlook on both trans-Pacific routes and those to Japan during spring was reasonably optimistic.
But Northwest Cargo, which said it is the largest US trans-Pacific carrier, was not anticipating any major rise in demand leading up to Chinese new year.
After the pre-Christmas dash to meet year-end quotas the market has died down but, thankfully, not as much as last year. Northwest also cancelled flights in early January due to lack of demand.
""After the peak, rates have dropped but not substantially. I would say they are normal for this time of year. Concerning volumes, it's a case of so far so good,"" the Northwest spokesman said.
He also said there is currently a trade imbalance with exports far exceeding imports and demand for traffic to the U.S. East coast markedly higher than to the West coast.
Thomas Miu, general manager of the air freight division of Jardine Freight Services, was also pessimistic about a pre-holiday 'mini-boom'.
""I doubt very much whether we will see a little bit of a rush before Chinese New Year which is just two weeks away. I don't see any sign yet. I'm hoping we will have a boom before Easter,"" Mui said.
A leading freight forwarder who uses a variety of airlines said space on flights from Hong Kong to New York was ""wide open"" with rates generally around HK$20.50. For destinations to the US west coast, average shipment prices were reported to be around $19.50.
Rates to Japan on so-called first-class carriers such as Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines Co Ltd are reported to be around $14 with around a $2 reduction at $12 for 'second tier' carriers such as United Airlines with no restriction problems on space.
Another trans-Pacific airline operating from Hong Kong, U.S.-based Evergreen International Airlines Inc, is operating a full schedule of four trans-Pacific freighter flights a week until Chinese New Year when, like many other carriers, all flights will be stopped as demand evaporates.
""The market is picking up after being a little bit slow which it usually is while people renew their export licences,"" reported Kersti Krepp. Trans-pacific rates remain firm, she added.
Japan Airlines is not yet ""in full swing"" after the early January lull but is another optimistic airline expecting another busy period before Chinese new year. JAL offers four freighters per week to Tokyo's Narita airport in addition to at least five daily passenger flights to Narita and Osaka offering around 15 tonnes belly capacity each with trans-pacific connections.
""Rates to Japan are holding steady, very stable. Trans-pacfic rates are negotiatable with different deals being done. Exports from Hong Kong are also exceeding imports,"" a JAL spokesman told Reuters.
The importance of the Japanese and trans-Pacific markets to Hong Kong's economy can be seen from the latest cargo statistics for November from the territory's Civil Aviation Department.
They show more than 21,000 tonnes of air freight exports to the U.S. while imports amount only to less than 5,500 tonnes. New York's JFK airport accounts for 4,400 tonnes of exports, Los Angeles 3,225, Columbus Ohio 3.071, Chicago 1,800 tonnes and San Francisco 985 tonnes.
For Japan, the statistics show Tokyo's Narita airport is the second most popular export destination from Hong Kong after Taipei. 9,016 tonnes was airlifted to Tokyo compared with 9,441 tonnes to Taipei during November.

JimGilchrist,"The cause of a fire on a Malaysian Airline System Bhd Airbus A330-300 aircraft while parked at Singapore's Changi airport three weeks ago is still under investigation, a MAS spokeswoman told Reuters.
The fire started in the early hours of January 4 when the aircraft was undergoing a routine overnight check, industry sources said.
Following the fire, on January 8 Airbus Industrie said it instructed all airlines operating both the A330 and A340 jets to de-activate one of the aircraft's electrically driven hydraulic pump systems implicated in two other similar fires.
An Airbus spokesman in Hong Kong emphasised that the pump system is only used as a back-up to operate the aircraft's cargo doors and is not active in-flight.
A total of 140 aircraft -- A330s and A340s -- operated by 25 airlines are involved.
Aviation industry sources said the hydraulic pump system was first suspected when an Air France A340 was destroyed by fire, followed by another fire aboard an Air Mauritius A340 while undergoing maintenance.
The MAS spokeswoman said the airline is still assessing the extent of the damage and could give no estimate of how much it will cost to repair or how long the aircraft will be out of action.
There is no serious effect on schedules, she added. MAS operate 11 A330 aircraft on its regional network.
She addded that MAS was awaiting an accident report from Singapore's civil aviation deparment before commenting further. --Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax:5017

JimGilchrist,"Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) is developing a new computerised memory system to ensure pallets fit into aircraft first time and avoid potentially costly delays, the company's deputy managing director Yueng Kwok Keung told Reuters in an interview.
HACTL hopes the new system, provisionally called a Pallet Contour Identification System, will save time, money and arguments with truck drivers insisting their cargo is packed properly.
Each arriving cargo will have to pass through a gantry fitted with precise measurement sensors which send high speed signals of a three dimensional picture to a computer. A memory bank contains a complete catalogue of all possible container contours and exact dimensions of each individual aircraft which use HACTL.
If the shape fits, the computer identifies the container as ""good to go"" and allows it to continue its journey. If the shape does not conform, the computer rejects it, long before handlers struggle to try to squeeze it into an aircraft, Yueng said.
""It's a very simple idea which can speed up the truck dock procedures and increase the reliability of container reception. It ensures there are no delays and every aircraft takes off with its intended load,"" Yueng said.
HACTL intends to test the prototype during the second quarter of this year at Kai Tak, continuously refine the design and implement the final design at the company's SuperTerminal One complex now under construction at Hong Kong's new airport.
Yeung, who is credited by observers as playing a leading role in developing HACTL's renowned computerised handling technology, said the new development could eventually be marketed to other air cargo operators around the world.
The cost of developing the new system has not been disclosed.

JoeOrtiz,"Britain's big banks look set to raise profits by some two billion pounds in 1997, taking the aggregate above 14 billion pounds ($22.6 billion), but volume-based revenue growth could be storing up problems, analysts said on Thursday.
The big six -- Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC Holdings, National Westminster, Abbey National and Standard Chartered -- drove profits up to 12.6 billion pounds in 1996 from 10.8 billion in 1995 but analysts were still a little disappointed.
John Aitken, banking analyst at UBS, expressed concern at a loss of momentum in underlying profit growth in the second half of 1996.
""Operating profit grew by an aggregate 17 percent in 1996 but there was a worrying loss of momentum in the second half which saw growth of only 12 percent, compared to 22.5 percent in the first,"" Aitken said.
Aitken does not anticipate a similar dip in the first half of this year but expects the momentum to continue to be lost as banks see their margins under pressure in 1997.
""There will be downward pressure on underlying margins in 1997 but growth in higher-margin business such as credit cards and consumer finance will largely offset that,"" said David Poutney, banking analyst at Panmure Gordon.
But, as Aitken noted, high-margin business has high margins for a reason -- it carries a higher risk, which is likely to result in an increase in bad debt charges in years to come.
Also affecting margins in the second half of 1997 will be the end of a so-called ""deposits lock-in"".
Large amounts of money are currently tied up in accounts at four mutally-owned building societies which are floating on the stock exchange this year. This has meant that banks and building societies have been able to pay lower rates for deposits because the market has been less competitive than normal.
Faster loan growth of the last three years will also mean that bad debt charges will begin to edge higher this year.
Analysts see even greater pressure on margins in 1998 when the lock-in effect is over.
While many sectors would be keen to have the ""problems"" of the banks, the warning signs look to be building up.
""All the major components of the profit and loss account are headed the wrong way,"" Aitken said. ""The only thing that is higher is volume growth and that carries both a capital cost and a potential risk cost.""
Some banks will show a sharp acceleration in pre-tax profit growth but their underlying performance will need watching, they said.
NatWest, for example, could see profits rise to two billion pounds from 1.12 billion, the latter figure heavily affected by losses associated with its sale of Bancorp, analysts forecast.
Abbey National will have a full-year contribution from National &amp; Provincial, while Lloyds TSB is expected to continue its surge, said John Leonard of Salomon Brothers.
Costs look to be fairly stable with certain major exceptions.
Barclays and NatWest will continue to spend money on their investment banking operations, which still provide low relative returns, and Standard Chartered has signalled a major boost to its investment programme, widely welcomed by analysts.
StanChart and HSBC, with their large Asia/Pacific region franchise, will continue to be dependent on those economies.
Both continue to be relaxed about the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule. The Hong Kong economy looks to be improving after a slowdown although problems in Thailand seem set to persist, analysts said.
For the future, both banks are well placed for the potentially huge Chinese market. But they are not letting market expectactions get out of control, Leonard added. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds)

JoeOrtiz,"Financial services group Cater Allen said on Friday its purchase of Glasgow-based stockbroker Aitken Campbell from Union Plc would complement its existing activities in share dealing and stock lending.
""We already have a number of allied operations like City Deal and in Cater Allen we have a significant stock lending operation,"" Cater's managing director David White said in an interview.
White declined to divulge the price of Aitken Campbell but said the amount was not significant and that, while contracts remained to be signed, both sides had sought to reassure both the market and Aitken staff by making an announcement.
""Aitken fits in quite nicely with City Deal and will be a sister company, we're not merging it into anything,"" White added.
He also noted one of the attractions of Aitken Campbell was that it runs one of only four electronic trading systems in the market -- the others belong to BZW, Kleinwort Benson and Merrill Lynch.
Cater still maintains its discount house and other money market activities and has also moved into fund management.
Union announced on February 25 that it was at an advanced stage in talks to sell Aitken Campbell as part of a major reorganisation, which saw the historic firm give up its role as a money market counterparty to the Bank of England.
Union is thought to have received a bid approach for the rest of the company, mainly an asset play based on its banking licence and desirable headquarters building in the heart of the City, from millionaire Joe Lewis who already owns 24 percent of Union.
Caribbean-based Lewis recently hit the headlines by investing 40 million stg in football club Glasgow Rangers.
Acting executive chairman of Union, Graeme Knox was not available for comment on reports that Lewis's English National Investment Company is offering a 110p cash and shares deal for Union whose shares currently stand at 96p.

JoeOrtiz,"Britain's markets watchdog banned former Barings treasury head Ian Hopkins on Tuesday from being a director in the City for at least three years for his part in the 1995 collapse of the investment bank.
In addition, the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) ordered Hopkins to pay 10,000 pounds ($16,000) towards the SFA's costs after an independent tribunal found that he was no longer a ""fit and proper person"" to be a director of an SFA-regulated City firm.
Hopkins, one of nine Barings executives to have been disciplined by the SFA, has always protested that he attempted to ""blow the whistle"" on irregularities in the Singapore operation but that other managers ignored his warnings.
But this interpretation of his role was rejected by SFA chairman Nick Durlacher. ""The facts do not support this suggestion. An impartial tribunal has scrupulously considered all the available evidence and judged (he) did not 'blow the whistle' with any clarity, force or urgency,"" said Durlacher.
Hopkins was ultimately responsible at Barings Investment Bank for funding the group's international activities. He provided funds to Barings's futures operation in Singapore where trader Nick Leeson ran up losses of 800 million pounds after massive unauthorised trading which led to the collapse of the bank in February 1995.
Barings, its capital spent, was put under administration and later bought by Dutch financial services company Internationale Nederlanden Groep and now trades as ING Barings.
Durlacher added that the tribunal had found that Hopkins's actions ""fell far short of the standards expected of a prudent man in such a senior position"". Hopkins did not offer a formal defence against the allegations but the tribunal took into account written evidence from Hopkins and others.
The SFA announced the result of its last case against a Barings manager last month when it banned James Bax for 21 months and ordered him to pay costs of 10,000 pounds.
The penalty handed out to Hopkins was at the high end of the range of those imposed on former Barings managers after the tribunal found that he failed to control or reconcile funding to Singapore, acting without ""due skill, care and diligence"".
Following the collapse of Barings, the SFA started proceedings against nine former senior executives but did not proceed against Peter Baring and Andrew Tuckey, chairman and deputy chairman respectively of Barings group.
The nine were former chief executive Peter Norris, Ron Baker, Bax, Geoff Broadhust, Tony Gamby, Tony Hawes, Hopkins, George Maclean and Mary Walz. The tribunal has yet to hear an appeal by Baker against the reprimand he received.
Baring and Tuckey left Barings after giving assurances that they would never again seek top management jobs in the financial markets.
Britain's Department of Trade has started legal proceedings which could ban the Barings nine plus Tuckey from being directors of any British company for up to 15 years.
The DTI is to hold preliminary hearings and then would set a timetable for a final hearing of the cases.
Norris, Tuckey, Baker, Walz, Hopkins, Gamby, Broadhurst and Bax also face writs from accountancy firm Cooper's &amp; Lybrand in third party proceedings after it was sued by Barings administrator Ernst &amp; Young for what is thought to be around one billion pounds.

JoeOrtiz,"SBC Warburg, the investment banking arm of Swiss Bank Corp, said on Wednesday it had been forced to take a loss on a 300 million pound ($478 million) share deal which is being investigated by Britain's financial markets watchdog.
The deal, the liquidation of part of the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust(KEPIT), is thought to have lost SBC Warburg around two million pounds and led to the resignation of Peter Corrigan, head of French equities, who left the firm last Friday.
Britain's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) confirmed on Wednesday that it is probing the deal.
""I can confirm that SFA is formally investigating SBC Warburg,"" an SFA spokesman said, adding he could make no further comment.
SBC, which announced its 1996 results on Wednesday, did not include a special provision for the loss but executive Marcel Ospel said in Basle that the bank was supporting the investigation ""in every way.""
An SBC Warburg spokesman told Reuters the firm  had ensured that KEPIT had not been disadvantaged as a result of a share sale.
The spokesman said that in connection with a bid for three of KEPIT's portfolios last October, ""the bank sought to sell into the market"" and that this had contributed to adverse price movements of the shares in the portfolios.
The fall in the share prices meant KEPIT might have received less than it had expected for the sale but SBC Warburg said it had ensured that the client did not lose out -- effectively taking the loss, thought to be around two million pounds, onto its own book.
Banking sources said the SFA investigation centred on the sharp fall of several European share prices on October, after SBC Warburg carried out the share sales for KEPIT.
The sources said SBC Warburg is denying allegations of market manipulation and is putting the loss down to an error in its attempt to hedge itself.
It appears this operation was mis-timed and Warburg was punished by the market, later agreeing to book the deal at the price which KEPIT had expected to receive.
Share markets on the day in question, October 30, 1996, were volatile after the Bank of England had raised British interest rates.
The Warburg spokesman said its compliance officials had been notified at once of the deal and had started their own internal investigation.
Sources said the SFA has a duty to investigate the background to such market events, usually as a result of being notified by one of the parties involved.

JoeOrtiz,"Martin Owen, under intense pressure as his NatWest Markets operation admitted a 90 million pound ($144 million) loss on derivatives trading, is at first glance an unlikely character to lead an investment bank with global aspirations.
The investment banking unit of British banking giant National Westminster Bank plc is run by a friendly, talkative man with a soft Welsh accent who trained as an accountant and takes an active role in the Salvation Army.
Doubts have persisted about NatWest's investment banking strategy which has expanded aggressively in the last 18 months through several acquisitions which some analysts have criticised as too expensive.
The big spending has included major expansion in the United States with the purchase of Greenwich Capital, a bond trading house, for $590 million and mergers and acquisitions specialist Gleacher for $135 million.
But by all accounts, Owen, 49, has made a good job of bringing the disparate parts of NatWest Markets together although, like its investment banking peers, this has meant a big rise in costs with more to come.
Some market observers say Owen does have difficulty with the mergers and acquisitions side of the business.
His background would support this view as Owen came to the top via NatWest's treasury and capital markets operations.
After working for American company Dow Corning Corp in Wales, Owen joined Welsh independent TV company HTV before starting his own accountancy and insurance business which he sold in 1979.
Three years of full-time work for the Salvation Army followed although Owen did manage to squeeze in an external doctorate in, ironically enough, risk management from the University of Southern California.
Thus qualified for the financial markets, Owen joined NatWest in 1983 only pausing for a short stint as a financial supervisor in the Isle of Man.
Analysts do not doubt Owen's ability to make the business bigger but they do question the wisdom of trying to emulate the big Wall Street investment banks.
Even under 1996's relatively favourable market conditions, NatWest Markets profits rose by 158 million pounds to 462 million. But when a big 96 million drop in provisions is taken into account, the 62 million pounds left have been more than wiped out by the options loss.
Owen, who has headed NatWest Markets since 1992, appears genuinely shocked that the options problem could have begun as long ago as the end of 1994.
""That is clearly unacceptable against the background of incidents at other firms as well,"" Owen said on Thursday. ""Fortunately it does seem to be isolated to this area.""
Some would say that fortune should not really come into the equation but at least these losses -- 77 million pounds after provisions and bonus cuts are taken into account -- are dwarfed by those posted by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell or Barings.
Owen will perhaps sleep more soundly after NatWest Group chief executive Derek Wanless expressed his confidence in him.
Wanless told Reuters in an interview that he had complete confidence in Owen, who will give up 200,000 pounds of a 500,000 pound bonus because of the options affair.
""It is a set-back for Martin in one area. We'll learn a lot from it, get those lessons put into practice and that will make us much stronger,"" Wanless said.

JoeOrtiz,"Britain's takeover watchdog on Friday handed out its strongest sanction to BZW, investment banking arm of Barclays Bank, over its conduct of a bid defence for Northern Electric last year.
The Takeover Panel ""criticised"" BZW for failing to disclose all the relevant facts, including a performance fee, during hearings over the conduct of the deal last December.
""This is the strongest sanction the panel can take and there is no further action intended,"" Alistair Defriez, director general of the panel told Reuters. ""We have no power to impose a fine.""
BZW said it was pleased that the Panel had found it had not deliberately concealed the performance fee and that there was no suggestion that the fee was an inducement for BZW to buy Northern shares which would have been in breach of the Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
The case stemmed from a 782 million pound ($1.2 billion) bid for regional electricity company Northern by CE Electric, a unit of CalEnergy Co Inc of the U.S. which proved to be hotly contested and the result extremely close.
Northern failed in its defence against CE, after the British company lost an appeal to the panel to reverse an extension of the offer period which enabled CE to narrowly win the bid.
The offer extension came after CE raised concerns about the purchase of Northern Electric shares by its advisers British merchant bank Schroders and BZW and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW which was a performance fee.
Northern in turn launched its own appeal against the extension of the deadline because at the time of the first cut-off date, CE had fallen short of the total needed to win.
But the panel finally ruled against Northern and BZW was heavily criticised in the press for effectively losing the bid for its client.
On Friday, the panel said it accepted that BZW had not deliberately concealed the fee but that the firm recognised that it should have considered the fee relevant to the panel's deliberations.
The criticism of BZW comes hot on the heels of a 90 million pound derivatives loss at its rival NatWest Markets and is bound to rekindle discussion of the conduct of British investment banks.
BZW has consistently defended its actions, saying that the performance fee was not based on the outcome of the bid and had nothing to do with its relatively unusual plan to aid the defence by purchasing nearly 20 million pounds worth of Northern shares.
But insiders accept that BZW made errors of judgement that undoubtedly led to Northern losing its independence. ($ = 0.627 British Pounds)
"
JoeOrtiz,"Just when they thought their strategy had been accepted by the market, British banks which are heavily involved in investment banking, are seeing their policy fundamentally questioned again.
Barclays and NatWest, who both have aspirations to build global investment banks to compete with the ""bulge-bracket"" Wall Street firms, have had a tough month.
First, BZW, the Barclays unit, posted a massive 29 percent fall in profits for 1996 -- a year which, especially in the bond markets, saw large profits for the big American houses.
Barclays' chief executive Martin Taylor, who has staked a lot on dragging BZW into the top league, vigorously defended the large cash injection into the investment bank.
""You have to be careful not to be frightened of your own shadow,"" he told Reuters in an interview last month. ""The reason that the returns are depressed this year is that we're spending so much,"" adding that BZW would be weaker without the investment.
Taylor has brought in some big and expensive names, like Bill Harrison of Flemings, to lead BZW through its next development stage but the markets may be running out of patience.
Meanwhile, at NatWest Markets, which has followed an acquisitive strategy over the past year, reputation and morale has suffered a direct hit from a stunning 90 million pound ($142.8 million) loss on derivatives.
This laid bare problems of control in what had been considered a tight ship steered by chief executive Martin Owen.
Owen has publicly admitted that the affair has holed NatWest Markets but only ""above the waterline"".
Its strategy was already being questioned before the derivatives debacle in much the same terms as that of BZW -- that it was buying units to bolt onto its core at the height of the market cycle.
Compared to banks like Lloyds TSB, firmly entrenched in a UK bancassurance strategy, analysts question how investment banking will add to shareholder value.
Panmure Gordon banking analyst David Poutney has described the banks' commitment to investment banking as ""lemming-like"" and the returns from the business as ""paltry"".
Analysts are dismayed at the commitment to cost growth in the investment banks but have been reassured that both are making continuing strides in restructuring and reprofiling their retail business though this is likely to become even more fiercely competitive in the near-term,.
At the moment, the jury still seems to be out but one analyst, who declined to be named, said the market will probably give BZW and NatWest Markets a couple of years to start showing what they can do.
The danger is that the market cycle could be against them.
""They have taken on a lot of staff and invested and acquired at the top of the cycle,"" the analyst said. ""If the market correction which people have been predicting happens in the second half of this year it will mean that profits will be hard to come by in 1997 and 1998.""
Already, rumours circulate that Barclays is looking to unload BZW and concentrate on improving the already highly respectable return produced by the retail banking side. But the bank dismisses this talk.
However, Panmure's Poutney said in a recent note, ""(A sale or demerger) would be massively bullish, and cynics who share our view should buy the shares.""
After nailing their colours so firmly to the investment banking mast, Taylor and Wanless would have a lot of explaining to do if they came, belatedly, to the same conclusion that Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Brian Pitman has been expounding for years.
Pitman has never liked the cyclical nature of investment banking profits and has presided over a stunning performance by Lloyds TSB which has better returns than any UK retail bank.
""Soon, people are going to demand a pay-back from all this investment,"" said another banking analyst. ""When that happens, there had better be some good answers or the market will not like it."" ($ = 0.630 British Pounds)

JoeOrtiz,"British private client stockbroker and fund manager Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management said on Thursday it is in talks with Dutch banking giant ABN AMRO's ABN AMRO Hoare Govett which may lead to an offer for CCM.
Capel-Cure is controlled by Canadian Insurance Group and chief executive John Henderson confirmed the talks but declined to give any of the financial details of the offer.
In Amsterdam, ABN AMRO confirmed that ABN AMRO Hoare Govett planned to buy CCM. ""Yes we're talking to Capel-Cure Myers about a takeover,"" ABN AMRO spokesman Tanno Massar told Reuters.
Massar said the planned deal was in line with ABN AMRO's declared goal of expanding in the field of asset management.
He declined to give details but said the two sides expected to reach agreement within a few weeks.
Capel-Cure has 4.5 billion pounds under management and employs around 450 staff.
Canadian Insurance, a consortium of banks, bought its stake in Capel-Cure -- the rest is owned by the management -- when Central Capital Corp of Canada went bust in 1992. It had previously been owned by Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Corp.
Henderson said the management of Capel-Cure had been involved at every stage and denied press reports that there had been a disagreement between the Capel-Cure management and Canadian Insurance on whether the fund manager should be sold and how.
ABN AMRO is known to have wanted to expand its London operations with a fund management acquisition.
In January, Jan Vroegop, director of ABN AMRO's global asset management operation said the bank wanted to make ""big steps"" in the lucrative London fund management arena.
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett was involved in a controversial attempt to poach star fund manager Nicola Horlick from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in January.

JoeOrtiz,"Interest rates on British home loans may rise this year due to upward pressure on savings rates, even if a new government does not immediately tighten monetary policy, analysts said on Thursday.
This is a separate issue from the question of whether the government should raise interest rates to nip inflation in the bud after the general election on May 1, they said.
The flotation of four building societies and the takeover of another will free as much as 140 billion pounds ($225 billion) of savings locked in nearly 30 million accounts in the societies, which provide home mortages.
This is around 25 percent of British retail savings and analysts expect a good proportion of this to be moved.
""I expect 15 billion pounds to be moved as a conservative estimate,"" said UBS building societies analyst Rob Thomas. ""The effect will be to push up savings rates and, since mortgage lending is largely funded from savings, mortgage margins will come under pressure and rates may rise.""
Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender with 20 percent of the market; Woolwich ; Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock are ending their mutual society status and floating on the stock market.
Savers had to deposit money in these building societies to qualify for free shares. But once the societies have floated, savers can move their money where they want.
The societies will have to fight hard to keep hold of the money as other institutions such as Abbey National and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, part of the Lloyds TSB Group want to grab a big chunk of the cash.
Analysts expect a fair proportion of the money to flow into pure spending or to other financial products such as unit trusts. But they also expect a large amount to be up for grabs within the savings and loan industry.
On Wednesday, Abbey National, which converted to bank status and floated in 1990, pointedly noted that much of the money can already be moved as members have already qualified for shares.
The Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, proclaiming its continued mutual ownership, said it would effectively raise savings rates and cut mortgage rates.
Thomas of UBS said the spread between mortgage rates and base rated was low historically following mortgage rate cuts in 1995 which outstripped an easing base rate.
Pressure on savings rates could trigger a rise for borrowers if institutions want to maintain margin which has already been difficult to do. ""This might even result in a round of mortgage rate rises not associated with a base rate rise,"" Thomas said.
David Poutney, banking analyst at Panmure Gordon expects the situation to be an opportunity for banks such as Abbey National. ""While competitive pressure will increase, the freeing up of the market will increase new business opportunities for the likes of the Abbey,"" he said. ($ = 0.624 British Pounds)

JoeOrtiz,"Prudential Corp Plc on Tuesday beat off rivals to win control of mutually-owned insurance group Scottish Amicable and reinforced its position as Britain's number one fund manager.
By beating bids from Abbey National Plc and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP), Prudential's takeover of ScotAm will raise its funds to more than 100 billion pounds.
Prudential shares rose as analysts saw the company as deriving strategic and earnings benefits from the deal. At 1315 GMT, Pru was up 17 pence at 557p.
""Pru has not gone crazy and paid a stupid price,"" said Michael Lindsay, analyst at Lehman Brothers. ""The acquisition looks to be earnings neutral in the first year and enhancing thereafter.""
ScotAm said with-profits policyholders would benefit from cash and additional policy benefits worth more than 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).
These include 600 million pounds from Prudential shareholders' and policyholders' funds in compensation for loss of membership rights and a special bonus from ScotAm's life fund worth 470 million pounds which will go into policies.
In addition, the entire remaining ScotAm life fund will be distributed, estimated to have a current value of 500 million pounds.
On this basis, ScotAm with profits policy holders should receive total benefits of around 1,400 pounds, varying according to the size and age of the policy.
Policyholders will also benefit from financial support to the tune of 1.3 billion pounds to boost ScotAm's life fund which will be closed.
ScotAm's original plan was to end its mutual status  and float on the stock exchange in two or three years time. But the plan was thrown into confusion after Abbey National made a bid for the firm last month.
The injection into the life fund had probably clinched its bid for the mutually-owned life company, Prudential chief executive Sir Peter Davis told Reuters.
""Our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the Prudential life fund,"" Davis said in an interview. ""We've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to 1.3 billion pounds to the (ScotAm) life fund.""
Davis said the boost to ScotAm's fund -- the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the Prudential umbrella -- will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy. This could include a greater proportion of investments in equities and higher returns.
The 1.3 billion pound investment comes from Prudential's life fund, which totals 51 billion pounds, and will be provided to ScotAm at a commercial rate.
The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June. The proposals will be subject to a 75 percent vote in favour by eligible members.
Davis said ScotAm will develop more successfully with Prudential's capital backing and is expected to show a larger rate of growth.
Roy Nicolson, managing director of ScotAm, told Reuters that the Prudential's offer of high up-front payments plus a reversionary bonus added to the capital support had swung the auction in Prudential's favour.
He said the new capital would allow greater investment in equities, providing the opportunity for better returns for policyholders in the future. Prudential's strong investment track record had also been a major factor.
""We're very excited about the business going forward,"" Nicolson said. ""We'll be able to expand our presence dramatically particularly in the IFA (independent financial adviser) market.""
Nicolson said the deal would remove any doubt about ScotAm's financial strength.
He said Prudential had pledged to maintain the number of jobs in the ScotAm head office for three years. Talks were already underway about the possibility of using the expertise in ScotAm's investment management arm in Prudential Portfolio managers.
Nicolson said it was far too early to know if there would be job losses outside the head office operation. ""We want to expand the sales side,"" Nicolson said.""As for the rest, we'll be having talks.""
ScotAm employs just over 2,000 people in Britain plus around 150 in an offshore and cross-border operation in Dublin which, Davis told a news conference, would also be expanded.

The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June. The proposals will be subject to a 75 percent vote in favour by eligible members.  
Davis said that on an embedded value or accruals basis, the merger would be earnings enhancing straight away but that on a modified accounting basis, which only takes account of profits on a new policy as bonuses start to be paid, the merger would be slightly dilutive for a couple of years.
The Prudential is paying 850 million stg from its shareholders' funds and its life fund. Coupled with the injection of up to 1.3 billion stg, this will allow the release of around 900 million stg over time from the ScotAm life fund to its policyholders.
Davis said ScotAm will develop more successfully with Prudential's capital backing and is expected to show a larger rate of growth.

JoeOrtiz,"Prudential Corp. Plc Tuesday beat out rivals to win control of mutually owned insurance group Scottish Amicable and reinforced its position as Britain's No. 1 fund manager.
By beating bids from Abbey National Plc and Australian Mutual Provident, Prudential's takeover of ScotAm will raise its funds to more than 100 billion pounds ($160 billion).
""Pru has not gone crazy and paid a stupid price,"" said Michael Lindsay, analyst at Lehman Brothers. ""The acquisition looks to be earnings neutral in the first year and enhancing thereafter.""
ScotAm said policy-holders would benefit from cash and additional policy benefits worth more than 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion). These include 600 million pounds ($957 million) from Prudential shareholders' and policy-holders' funds in compensation for loss of membership rights and a special bonus from ScotAm's life fund worth 470 million pounds ($750 million), which will go into policies.
In addition, the entire remaining ScotAm life fund will be distributed, estimated to have a current value of 500 million pounds ($797 million).
On this basis, ScotAm with profits policy holders should receive total benefits of around 1,400 pounds ($2,232), varying according to the size and age of the policy.
Policy-holders will also benefit from financial support to the tune of 1.3 billion pounds ($2.07 billion) to boost ScotAm's life fund which will be closed.
ScotAm's original plan was to end its mutual status  and float shares on the stock exchange in two or three years. But the plan was thrown into confusion after Abbey National made a bid for the firm last month.
""Our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the Prudential life fund,"" Prudential chief executive Sir Peter Davis told Reuters. ""We've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to 1.3 billion pounds ($2.07 billion) to the (ScotAm) life fund.""
Davis said the boost to ScotAm's fund -- the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the Prudential umbrella -- will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy. This could include a greater proportion of investments in equities and higher returns.
The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June.
Roy Nicolson, managing director of ScotAm, told Reuters the new capital would allow greater investment in equities, providing the opportunity for better returns for policy-holders in the future.
He said Prudential had pledged to maintain the number of jobs in the ScotAm head office for three years. He said it was far too early to know if there would be job losses outside the head office.

JoeOrtiz,"British insurance and asset management giant Prudential Corp Plc on Wednesday beat analysts' forecasts with an eight percent rise in first half profits to 421.0 million pounds ($655 million).
Prudential chief executive Peter Davis said the company wanted to buy a home loan lender to build its customer base but he refused to be drawn on which building society, if any, the Prudential was talking to.
""We are interested in buying a building society but for its branch network and its customer base rather than its mortgage book,"" Davis said in an interview.
The Prudential, which next month will launch a telephone banking business, raised its interim dividend by 9.4 percent to 5.8 pence per share.
The first-half data included 33 million pounds of start-up costs for the new banking operation, which chief executive Peter Davis said was on course for launch on October 1.
Davis said the life insurance business was benefiting from a general upturn in consumer confidence in Britain.
""Customers are feeling a little more confident and are more willing to make commitments.""
But Davis noted that single contribution products were still showing far more growth than those that require a longer-term commitment or regular contributions.
Prudential's single contribution sales rose by 50 percent in the first half of the year compared with a gain of 15 percent for regular contribution sales.
Davis said the personal pensions industry had still not completely thrown off the stigma of a private pensions scandal in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said consumers were starting to realise they must make adequate pension provision.
Prudential said funds under management had risen by four percent since the end of 1995 to 85 billion pounds. Profit from this business rose to 14 million pounds from eight million in the first half of last year.
Davis hoped there would be no lasting knock-on effect on the fund management industry from recent events at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), but said the affair was sure to make investors look closely at the standing of the institution with which they have their money invested.
""It's likely to be a swings and roundabouts thing,"" Davis said. ""There will probably be a general loss of confidence but we will also see some flight to quality and security.""
MGAM last week suspended three of its unit trust funds for three days after the discovery of alleged irregularities but trade resumed after a casj injection from the company's German parent Deutsche Bank. ($1=.6430 Pound)

""We are interested in buying a building society but for its branch network and its customer base rather than its mortgage book,"" Davis told Reuters in an interview.
Davis was speaking after Prudential raised first half operating profit, a measure it prefers to pre-tax profit, by 8.0 percent to 421 million stg compared to 390 million last time.  
Davis said he would not comment on any specific names that have been linked to Prudential which have recently included Lloyds Abbey Life, currently controlled by LLoyds TSB Plc.
But industry sources say it is extremely unlikely that the Prudential would be interested in Lloyds Abbey.
Davis was upbeat about the prospects of the Prudential's telephone banking operation which is launched on October 1 and will see its direct sales force selling products like mortgages to its existing customer base.  
Customers will also be introduced to the company's deposit products.
The start-up has cost the Prudential around 33 million stg which was included as a charge in the calculation of operating profit.
Davis said that Prudential's funds under management have risen by four percent since the end of 1995 to 85 billion stg while profit rose to 14 million stg from eight million in the first half of last year.

JoeOrtiz,"Royal Bank of Scotland has seen its corporate and institutional banking (CIB) unit show good growth in recent years using a strategy which rejects any idea of competing in the increasingly crowded investment banking world.
Its managing director Iain Robertson told Reuters in an interview that CIB now produces some 30 percent of the banks profits, a figure expected to rise to around 40 percent.
""We are not an investment bank and we're not a securities house,"" Robertson said, ""and frankly, I don't have the billion pounds that I would actually have to spend to become one, nor have I any desire to do so.""
Royal Bank's strategy contrasts with some others which have been devoting large amounts of capital, investment and other resources in fully-fledged investment banking with, to say the least, questionable returns.
Royal Bank's success has been based on its traditional features which have been updated by Robertson who insists that it will persist along its current profitable line.
CIB has seen those profits rise to 207 million stg last year from 43 million in 1991 and they are expected by analysts to rise again in the 1996/97 results to be announced soon.
These figures produce a return of over 20 percent on risk adjusted equity -- highly respectable and a lot better than some higher profile investment banking operations.
Since October 1 last year, Royal Bank has been running all of its corporate relationships, big and small in CIB whereas previously only large corporates, financial institutions and companies with a turnover of over 100 million stg, were grouped there.
The transfer of small and medium corporates will immediately raise CIB's share of profits of the group to 40 percent and Robertson sees this staying fairly stable given that the retail side will also grow.
The move to bring in the small and medium corporate sectors into CIB stemmed from the fact that Royal Bank's retail operation has developed a much stronger personal focus in the last few years and managers perceived that the smaller corporate customers no longer identified with the retail side.
Robertson, a Glaswegian who came to Royal Bank after being deputy chief executive at County NatWest, the forerunner of NatWest Markets, is delighted that, in the homogenous world of modern banking, CIB has some ""unique"" features to offer.
He said Royal Bank was well known among its clients for having probably the shortest management lines in the business and has brought in staff with a big diversity of experience outside banking.
""In areas like property, we have brought in professionals who know the terms and conditions of property investment -- what will stick and what will not stick.""
Robertson says he wanted CIB to be the leading independent provider of corporate banking services in the UK.
""We have no axe to grind in terms of providing equity or securities or anything else. We will tell them what we think they can achieve in the debt markets and we'll put our corporate reputation behind what we say,"" he added.
CIB's major business groupings are Treasury and Capital Markets including foreign exchange; bond sales; securitisation, Structured Finance, which includes syndicated loans; project finance; and credit trading and Risk Finance which includes acquisition finance and development capital and Trust Bank which is substantial investor services business.
The group has main offices in Edinburgh and Manchester as well as London.
Robertson said the bank wanted to develop its niche products outside the UK possibly with joint ventures such as that in project finance with Banco Santander in South America.
Royal Bank has a high quality book of around $1.0 billion in the US but sees little opportunity for indigenous major growth.
In the core business, he also sees the opportunity to grab market share from competitors by adopting the same strategy seen in its large corporate business of cross-selling products.

JoeOrtiz,"News that HSBC Holdings is to follow its recent Mexican investment by dipping a rather bigger toe in Brazilian waters was greeted with enthusiasm by analysts tinged only with the caution that the words ""Latin America"" still engender.
But they recognised that the economic and political strides made by the major countries in Latin America -- Mexico, Argentina and Brazil and in the smaller economies like Chile, Peru and Ecuador -- make the continent a hotbed of opportunity.
""It's a large and growing market where a well-run bank with a large franchise can make money,"" said one analyst.
HSBC's purchase of Bamerindus has involved the London-based banking giant which has major interests in the UK, Asia and the U.S., in spending 1.0 billion reais ($945 million) in a move which came after the Brazilian central bank closed the loss-making Bamerindus down.
Of this amount, 400 million reais has been paid out on goodwill, infrastructure and other intangible assets.
Douglas Flint, HSBC's finance director, told Reuters in an interview that the money had been paid in cash and denied speculation that the transaction had included any form of discounted Brazilian debt paper.
He said Banco HSBC Bamerindus, as it now known, will take the assets that it wants from the old bank with the rest remaining with the shell.
Flint said Bamerindus would be expanded but would first have to be re-established following the liquidity problems which had dogged it. He said it would be bold to predict when the investment would prove to be positive for HSBC's earnings but added that this was unlikely to be beyond the short-term.
Among few concerns expressed by London analysts was the durability of Brazil's economic and political stability and the quality of management HSBC could count on at Bamerindus.
Flint said the question of management was the first thing HSBC had addressed, already putting in 50 executives.
""We have got managers and executives who have experience of taking on many-branched operations with large workforces, instilling our operating practices and culture and making a success of it,"" Flint said, adding that HSBC had given no guarantees on staffing.
The buy is seen as typical for HSBC which has made a speciality of buying in what might be termed opportunistic circumstances. Analysts say this was the case with its purchase of Hang Seng Bank in the Sixties, the UK's Midland Bank and Marine Midland in the U.S.
Last month, HSBC paid around $300 million for a 19.9 percent stake in Mexico's Grupo Financiero Serfin, another previously loss-making institution, and has involvement in Chile, Argentina, Panama and Peru.
Analysts say that a few years ago, Latin America did not seem central to HSBC's strategy but the improving macro-economic and political climate coupled with the continent's growing ties with HSBC's heartland in the Pacific Rim have made the bank reconsider its strategy.
""We are very bullish on Brazil both as an economy and in terms of banking profitability,"" said Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley. ""It's a growth market with a highly bankable population.""
Analysts agreed that for a country of its size and population Brazil is under-banked and its history of economic mismanagement has meant that banks are little trusted and general poorly run with the major exception of its largest private bank Bradesco which posted record profits in 1996.
Even Britain's conservative Lloyds TSB Group is expanding its interests in Brazil. It recently bought the consumer finance business of its 50 percent-owned associate Banco Multiplic and is known to be cautiously weighing up further overseas expansion.
This desire may stem from the fact that margins in domestic banking are likely to come under increasing pressure in a market which many regard as over-populated and which, if anything, is likely to become even more so with ever more institutions aggressively chasing the same type of business.
""Around the world, financial markets are consolidating and new competitive threats are arising from non-traditional participants in those markets,"" said HSBC chairman Sir William Purves recently.
That's just how some Brazilian banks must be feeling this week.

JoeOrtiz,"What would a bank do if it woke up one morning and found that all its customers were dead?
Hopefully it would realise that it was Jan. 1, 2000, but, more hopefully still, it will have taken action to make sure the turn of the century does not turn out to be the biggest computer disaster ever.
It takes something like the ""millennium bug"" to make people even think about how dependent most of us are on the internal workings of the financial system.
Doomsday scenarios of what the bug might do go as far as to predict the destruction of the financial system. It's not really a bug at all but purely the fact that up to now computers have represented the date year in two digits rather than four.
Needless to say, bankers and information technology experts deny any possibility of this with the British banking system insisting it will be ""millennium-compatible"" by the end of 1998 -- leaving a year for any last minute tweaking.
Though when questioned about specifics, the answers start to take on a worrying vagueness akin to that seen when they are asked about their preparations for European monetary union (EMU).
Left unresolved, computers might treat the date Jan. 1, 2000 as Jan. 1, 1900 and if asked to calculate the period between 1995 and 2000 would then come up with the answer ""minus 95 years"" -- not much use to anyone and potentially dangerous.
Britain's major banks are busily trying to solve the problem and one of the biggest, NatWest, said recently that it will spend as much as 100 million British pounds ($163 million) over the next couple of years to get its systems in line.
One of the complications in banking and finance is that none of the computer systems work in isolation, they all have to interrelate extensively with systems in other banks and in other companies and with the clearing and payments systems.
Indeed, the problems have already started, with computers in stores refusing to recognise credit cards with an expiry date after the end of 1999.
""The main issue that has emerged is that banks are so reliant on each other,"" said Will Mason of the British Bankers' Association (BBA). ""There is work going on to develop standards for people using networks to be compatible.""
In Britain, the BACS (bankers' automated clearing system) receives inputs from all sorts of companies. The system processes salary checks and the payment of bills and dividends, for example.
Banks have to be sure corporate customers using this system have their own systems in order and this must all be done by the end of 1998 to leave time for last-minute changes.
Investment banking is, if anything, even more susceptible to date problems as nearly every transaction will carry a value date or involve the difference in price or interest rate between two dates. The potential for problems is huge.
""The problem is that you're likely to get something that doesn't work properly rather than doesn't work at all,"" Mason said. ""Which is even worse.""
Banks are finding the task of altering their systems a highly detailed piece of work. They have to find out what the system will do in a highly complex series of transactions and then make it do the right thing. They often are using already existing back-up systems to test what might happen on their main system.
Among other wrinkles that are becoming apparent is that users have been using the date field in a programme to denote things other than just a specific date.
If for example, loans have no fixed term, this may have been denoted by using ""99"" in the date box or dead customers may have been denoted by using ""00.""
When we get there, the system will kill off all the customers.
A lot of systems in banking are relatively old. They have lasted a lot longer than was originally expected and are often written in computer languages that are no longer much used.

JoeOrtiz,"British insurance and financial services company Legal &amp; General Plc on Thursday posted a larger-than-expected rise in operating profit to 134.3 million pounds ($208.9 million) after 111.1 million in the first half of last year.
The insurer also weighed in with a 13.6 percent rise in its interim dividend to 8.75p per share after 7.7p last time.
Legal &amp; General said it could also benefit from the recent investment management problems at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM).
Chief executive David Prosser told Reuters he did not expect the negative impact of the debacle at MGAM, a unit of Deutsche Bank, to be very great.
""I don't think there will be much (negative impact),"" Prosser said. ""It's a well-regulated market and IMRO will make sure investors don't lose out.""
The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation has launched an enquiry into how investment funds at MGAM were managed following their temporary suspension last week after MGAM said it had found possible irregularities.
Prosser added that Legal and General could actually benefit.
""We could have some benefit,"" Prosser said. ""We are a strong company with a triple-A (credit) rating, one of the few life houses to have one.""
He added that, given Legal &amp; General's strong brand name, it could see some positive backlash from the affair.
Prosser said the first half results had been achieved in a market which remains highly competitive.
""The strong increase in new business, especially in life and pensions income, enhances the group's future profit potential.""
The company's pre-tax profit was inflated to 1.51 billion pounds compared with 119.1 million last time by changes in reporting standards as required by a European Union directive.
The figure for the first half of this year includes 1.402 billion pounds reclassified from its shareholders' retained capital within its UK long-term fund.
The operating result was at the high end of analysts' forecasts and the dividend higher than expected and L&amp;G shares stood 16.5 pence higher at 745p per share by 1000 GMT.
Looking to the future, Prosser reiterated that growth by acquisition does not form part of Legal &amp; General's strategy.
""I would never say ""never"" but an acquisition is not part of the strategy,"" Prosser said.
He said Legal &amp; General's strategy consists of organic growth from multi-channel selling approach which, in turn, is based on good value for money products and advice-based selling.
""The strategy is not dependent on buying anyone or merging with anyone,"" Prosser added.
Prosser said second half trading had continued the good results but noted that the very good performance of the company's bulk annuity business is unlikely to be repeated in the second six months.
L&amp;G said it would perform a five-for-two share split of its ordinary shares subject to shareholder approval, which a spokeman said was being done to aid market liquidity. ($1=.6430 Pound)

JohnMastrini,"The outgoing vice-chairman of Czech Skoda Auto a.s., a unit of Volkswagen AG , rejected as ""nonsense"" on Wednesday a German magazine report connecting him to a VW bribery affair under investigation.
Volkhard Koehler was unexpectedly replaced on Skoda's board last week, and a subsequent story in the weekly Der Spiegel said it was because he had prevented an investigation into a bribery affair linked to VW employees and was involved in dubious real estate transactions.
A Skoda spokesman, Milan Smutny, said in a statement on Wednesday that Koehler had spoken to economic corruption investigators in the German city of Braunschweig who confirmed that he was not the subject of any investigation.
""The state prosecution office confirmed that (Koehler) is not the target of any investigation,"" Smutny said. He quoted Koehler as saying Der Spiegel's claims were ""absolutely nonsense"".
VW chairman Ferdinand Piech said last week that corruption allegations, which centred on a plant expansion contract for Skoda awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB , involved ""a nearly double-digit sum in the millions of marks"".
He said a probe into allegations that VW employees have demanded and received bribes in return for contracts, had so far turned up only one employee who has since been suspended.
The employee was not named.
Piech said the figures involved are well below German media reports that have said the contract was worth some 400 million marks and included bribes of about 20 million marks.
VW said its purchasing division in the summer of 1994 approved a 74 million mark contract for a Skoda paint factory and a second contract worth 38 million marks to expand the facility.
Smutny said that all decisions on purchases over 100,000 marks at Skoda had to be approved by officials at Volkswagen headquarters in Germany.
German prosecutors in Braunschweig have said they were investigating two suspects as part of their probe at VW, brought about by the carmaker in a formal legal request.
Smutny said Koehler was expecting another assignment from VW headquarters in Wolfsburg after his stint with Skoda ends on April 15. He said that the non-renewal of his contract conformed to standard Volkswagen practice.
The functions of Skoda board members named last week will be announced in a news conference on April 3, Smutny said.

JohnMastrini,"Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said on Monday his country viewed as frivolous and ""absolutely unacceptable"" Russian threats of economic reprisals for Prague's entry into NATO.
""We consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance with bilateral (Czech-Russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context,"" the Czech news agency CTK quoted Zieleniec as saying.
On Sunday, Moscow's ambassador to Prague Nikolai Ryabov warned the Czech Republic that key bilateral agreements with Russia might be jeopardised if it joined NATO.
Ryabov told Russia's NTV commercial television that the former Warsaw Pact member's entry into the western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for Moscow.
""It would be a real blow for the Russian economy,"" he said.
The ambassador went on to hint that Moscow could reconsider economic deals with Prague if it went ahead.
""Agreements fundamental to the Czech Republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face (if Prague joined NATO),"" said Ryabov, former head of Russia's central electoral commission.
Zieleniec told CTK that Ryabov's statement made it clear why the Czechs wanted to join western organisations.
""This type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important, at the earliest, to become a member of the key western political, economic, and security organisations,"" it quoted Zieleniec as saying.
He said he thought the ambassador's interview on Russian television was mostly for media consumption.
The Czechs, Poland and Hungary are expected to be named among the first former-Soviet Bloc countries to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid.
Russian officials have intensified their rhetoric against NATO expansion plans, which they say threaten Russia's security, in the run-up to a summit in Helsinki this week between President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. Bill Clinton.
Moscow hopes to use the issue as a lever with which to win concessions from the U.S.-led alliance on arms control agreements and other security and economic issues.
After the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total Czech trade turnover with Russia grew 9.8 percent in 1996 to $2.8 billion.
But 1996 trade was heavily weighted in Russia's favour with Czech exports to Russia at $694 million and while imports from Russia were $2.1 billion.
Czechs are still dependent on Russia for natural gas and most of its crude oil, but Prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long-term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from Norway.
Last year, the Czechs opened the Ingolstadt spur in the Transalpine crude pipeline from the Adriatic Sea, providing direct access to crude from the Middle East.
The Czech power company CEZ a.s. is also dependent on Russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at Dukovany, but the company is expected to take U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at Temelin by the end of the century.
The Czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly Soviet-era equipment with Western-made, NATO compatible goods.

JohnMastrini,"The head of Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe, David Mulford, said on Thursday that while economies were gaining speed throughout Eastern Europe, CSFB would concentrate its activity where it was already based.
""I don't think we will see any major shift"" of CSFB's business in Eastern Europe, Mulford, who was appointed CSFB Europe chairman last month, told journalists.
He said that beyond CSFB's established investment banking business in Poland, Hungary, Russia and the Czech Republic, few new beachheads were planned.
""The only change...is that we have opened an operation recently in Kiev, because we think Ukraine is a very promising market, but I don't anticipate any further office operations elsewhere,"" he said while visiting CSFB's Prague office.
Mulford, a former U.S. assistant treasury secretary in the Bush administration, took over a restructured CSFB last month saying ""Europe, Russia and the emerging economies of central Europe are key to our long-term success in world finance.""
A recent CSFB research report showed that overall gross domestic product in the former East Bloc was picking up, and the entire region would show average positive growth by the end of the century, after massive post-Communist recessions.
But CSFB said there would be a convergence of average growth rates below five percent in the region by 2000 as robust Czech, Polish, and Hungarian economies slowed and countries further east pick up strength.
Mulford said each country had to balance the quest for lower inflation with a need to maintain economic growth.
""It's important to have reasonable positive growth. If you have a seven or eight percent growth level and it goes down to a five percent growth level, I don't think people should talk about that as a recession or a major setback,"" he said.
""But I do think that growth down around the one or two percent levels for extended periods...are not particularly helpful, although I would also say that inflation is a major enemy of long-term stability.""
He said that while it was still necessary to price growth out of the system, each government had its own level of political tolerance for inflation.
""People have to have a sense of progress, but if you have high inflation you don't necessarily have a feeling of progress...You've got to strike the right balance.""
In Prague, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus recently criticised the Czech National Bank for going to far in efforts to slow inflation below eight percent annually last year, saying that an excessively tight monetary policy had slowed growth.
Analysts said Czech 1996 real GDP -- once forecast at well above five percent growth -- would fall well short of four percent growth in data due to be released on Friday.
""I think when you mention the slowing of growth here, which has been more noticable than Poland for example -- although you've seen the same thing a couple of years ago in Hungary -- I mean that's normal,"" Mulford said.
""It's not easy keeping everything going at the same pace, and some of the adjustments are quite difficult and quite painful and take time, and are politically hard to accomplish.
He said despite a ballooning Czech current account deficit, which topped eight percent of GDP in 1996, and rising wage-labour costs, the slowing in Czech growth should not last.
""I think this is temporary. Problems are being addressed. The government recognises that there are issues which have to be dealt with, and I think we will see that happen,"" he said.
""In other words, I don't think we're heading toward a period of negative development.""

JohnMastrini,"Czechs, with a relatively large number of Oscar-winning films and filmmakers for a small nation, on Tuesday praised Jan and Zdenek Sverak for bringing home a coveted Academy Award for their film ""Kolya"".
The story of an ageing bachelor's re-awakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 Velvet Revolution won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in the ceremony held late on Monday.
President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident playwright under communism who acted in a few films himself, sent a victory telegram to the family Sverak in Los Angeles.
""I am pleased with the great success of your film. I am happy that after many years a Czech film has again received the Oscar,"" Havel's press office quoted the telegram as saying.
Local newscasts headlined the Kolya win for the director Jan, 31, and his scriptwriter father Zdenek, who played the greybeard bachelor in Kolya.
""The Oscar Goes to Prague"" heralded the capital city's daily Vecernik Praha.
It was the first Czech foreign language film Oscar since Jiri Menzel's ""Closely Observed Trains"" won in 1968 amid the period known worldwide as the ""Czech New Wave"".
Slovak Elmar Klos won the best foreign film Oscar in 1966 for ""The Shop on Main Street"" when Czechoslovakia was still ruled as one state.
This country of 10 million people also lays claim to director Milos Forman, a Prague native who made the Oscar-winning ""Amadeus"" (1985) and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1976) after emigrating to the United States.
Forman failed to pick up best director honours on Monday after his nomination for ""The People Versus Larry Flint"", after winning a Golden Globe and the Berlin's Golden Bear for the film.
The Sverak team made their first international splash in 1992, when the post-war drama-comedy ""Elementary School"" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost.
Zdenek is currently working on the team's first original English-language script.
Critics say Kolya, a politically-charged comedy/drama which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech New Wave.
""The film is about how the understanding between nations is much more important than the power,"" Sverak told reporters backstage after winning the Oscar.
Earlier this month Kolya won the Czech version of the Oscar, the Czech Lev (Lion), for best picture, but Zdenek Sverak was edged out for the best Czech actor award by Bolek Polivka, a popular cabaret comedian.
Kolya was favoured to take home the Oscar after winning Hollywood's Golden Globe for best foreign language film in January.

JohnMastrini,"The right-wing Czech coalition government ended nine uneasy months of ruling with a parliamentary minority on Tuesday when a former opposition deputy crossed the aisle to bring it a key seat.
Tomas Teplik, recently expelled from the opposition Social Democratic Party (CSSD), joined Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS), an official in the ODS's parliament office told Reuters.
The switch gives the ruling coalition 100 seats in the 200-seat lower house of parliament, after having a minority since general elections last June.
""I can confirm that the (ODS parliamentary) caucus voted to accept Teplik,"" said Vlasta Kloncarova of the ODS.
Financial analysts welcomed the news which they said would increase confidence in the Czech economy. ""I would call it a higher level of comfort,"" said Jan Pudil, director of the Prague-based investment house WoodCommerz.
""This is going to take away the political questions... and keep investors focusing on the fundamentals in the macro-economy, which is the way it should be,"" he added.
Klaus's coalition, which has held power longer than any conservative government in post-Communist Europe, lost its large majority in parliament last June after a surprisingly strong second place showing by the centre-left Social Democrats.
Though divided on some issues, the coalition has remained united in all key votes.
Another former CSSD member, budget committee chairman Josef Wagner, declared himself an independent last weekend after the Social Democrats expelled him for voting with the ruling coalition last December on the 1997 budget.
The CSSD expelled Teplik -- who also voted with the government on the budget -- along with Wagner late last year, but unlike Wagner, Teplik did not try to rejoin the CSSD.
Wagner's membership was officially terminated by the CSSD's national congress earlier this month, and he has said he will remain ""an independent Social Democrat.""
He has said he will not necessarily vote with the government to give the coalition an absolute majority.
Marie Noveska, who was elected as a CSSD deputy last June but resigned from the party after it was revealed that she had falsely used a ""Doctor of Law"" title, has remained in parliament as an independent.

JohnMastrini,"Congressional approval to expand NATO to former communist Europe is not assured as top aspirants must still prove they can pay their way, a key supporter of expansion in the U.S. Senate said on Wednesday.
""I think many of my Czech friends and my Polish friends think this is a foregone conclusion in the United States Senate,"" Joseph Biden, ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, told reporters.
""It is not... a 'done deal'.""
Biden, on a tour of regional capitals, said he must fight a ""growing neo-isolationism in the United States"".
But to do that, he said he must prove top candidates for expansion -- which he listed as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia -- were ready to fulfill all criteria for joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
""When I stand... as the spokesperson for my party on these issues and I say 'Expand NATO', they're going to say 'Okay, are they (applicants) ready to pay'? And to be very blunt with you I don't think those questions -- that question -- has been addressed in Poland or here in the Czech Republic,"" Biden said.
NATO is expected to invite a number of countries to join the alliance at a July summit of member states in Madrid, but Biden said that achieving the two-thirds vote required in the Senate to approve the change in the NATO charter may be tough.
Czech diplomats last autumn said then-U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and then-United Nations ambassador Madeleine Albright both expressed concern about what they regarded as the low level of Czech defence spending.
The worries were expressed in meetings with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec.
Klaus denied that Christopher had said this when they met in September, but later the Foreign Ministry confirmed that the subject had been raised by the Americans.
All NATO aspirants are struggling to find financing to modernise their forces to be compatible with NATO at the same time their economies are undergoing massive reforms.
Still, NATO membership remains a top foreign policy priority of former communist countries in central Europe.
Biden said he was ""confident"" the questions on committments to meet NATO requirements -- expected to costs billions of dollars -- would eventually be answered by aspirants.
""If they are not, I think we lose the day, if they are, I think my position prevails.""
The Clinton administration last month said the cost for expanding NATO eastward was expected to be between $27 billion and $35 billion up to the year 2009, with the U.S. expected to bear costs of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.
Biden said he would have preferred a slower approach to NATO expansion, but since the Clinton administration had made the committment to expand quickly, there was no turning back.
""What happens in Europe is significantly impacted upon by whether or not we are here with both feet planted on the ground as a player in Europe. To the extent we are not, our security diminishes long term,"" he said.
He said the opposition to expansion in Congress was ""real"" and it was growing.
Democratic Representative David Obey of Wisconsin earlier this month called NATO's quick eastward expansion an ""historically arrogant decision which we will come to regret.""
""I believe (turning back from NATO expansion) would raise serious doubts about America's long-term commitment in Europe,"" Biden said. ""I think that arrogance would be if we did not do all in our power to pull (NATO aspirants) closer to the west.""

JohnMastrini,"The Czech industrial sector is ""really in weak shape"" with generally low profits and poor corporate leadership, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Czech team leader said on Wednesday.
Speaking to an international banking forum Jiri Huebner of the London-based EBRD said return on equity among large Czech firms averaged just 3.5 percent last year, while the early months of 1997 have shown a sharp slowdown in output.
""Consequently a typical Czech company's profitability is so low that there are insufficient profits to pay dividends -- over 90 percent did not pay or declare any dividends,"" he said.
""Is the Czech industrial sector really in weak shape? I think it is.""
Huebner said a key problem was debt loads of company owners -- mostly large domestic funds and holding firms -- carried over from leveraged buyouts used after the coupon-based privatisation scheme, and the ownership structure which has emerged.
He quoted the EBRD's own study of fifty of the largest Czech companies which showed that the average level of debt leverage was about 43 percent of the total balance sheet -- and about 58 percent at engineering companies.
This situation, coupled with uncertainty about poorly regulated capital markets, have combined to keep foreign equity investment at bay, he said.
""As a consequence, most industrial companies face internal cash constraints for financing new investments and for modernisation which are often needed to achieve a leap in productivity,"" Huebner said.
""Since coupon privatisation by its nature involved only a change of ownership, Czech companies had little resources to restructure.""
Huebner said Czech managers must take strong initiatives to restructure firms since shareholders are proving ineffective.
He called on managers to formulate their own long-term plans for investment since ""many owners do not behave like long-term strategic investors"" but instead massively practice transfer pricing and short-term speculation.
""In the absence of their own plans, most controlling shareholders will probably not block the managements' intiatives,"" Huebner said.
""All the enterprising and competent Czech managements should take advantage of this and fill in the prevailing vacuum of corporate governance.""
Among the points Huebner prescribed to revitalise Czech industry, which posted a real contraction in output of 3.9 percent in January, the government should:
* Adopt a tax system which allows wider writeoffs, rewarding rational decision making by mangement, and lowering punitive tax burdens.
* More strictly enforce rules against transfer pricing between holdings, giving greater protection to minority shareholders, and increasing tax collection.
* Encourage more equity expansions by firms by liberalising rights issues procedures and allowing management more freedom to initiate equity issues.
* Split banks' investment activities so that corporate decisions do not conflict with lending interests.
Also:
* Banks should be more discriminating in financing leveraged buyouts.
* Management must take a robust intiative to restructure.

JohnMastrini,"The Czech central bank should not prop up the crown even if it fell to the low end of its fluctuation band, a leading Czech economist said on Thursday.
Without central bank intervention the market could force the crown as low as 20 percent below parity with its mark/dollar basket, Jan Svejnar, director of the Economics Institute at the Czech Academy of Sciences, said in an interview.
This would give natural support to troubled Czech exports, he added.
Svejnar said he was not advising an official devaluation of the currency, but calling for the central bank to allow a market-driven depreciation in line with the existing macroeconomic situation.
""I'm not saying that the central bank should go and devalue (but)...should be ready to let the currency depreciate,"" said Svejnar, who is also a professor at the University of Michigan.
The central bank and Czech government have repeatedly ruled out a devaluation to boost exports, and the Czech National Bank agreed in its meeting on Thursday not to change its current policies.
The central bank fixes the crown daily against a mark/dollar basket but allows it to fluctuate on the market within a corridor of plus or minus 7.5 percent of its basket parity.
The CNB widened the band in February 1996 from plus/minus 0.5 percent and since then has virtually matched the market rate each day. The crown was fixed at the equivalent of 1.39 percent on Thursday.
With the country's current account deficit exceeding eight percent of gross domestic product, the crown fell last week to a nine-month low after hitting record levels of 5.51 percent above basket parity in early February.
Investors have moved into crown paper to take advantage of real interest rate differentials with major currencies.
""What I am more worried about is... sooner or later (the trade balance) will become untenable,"" said Svejnar, adding that foreign capital would then flee the country.
He said that with the central bank foreign exchange reserves covering just about five months of average imports, central bank intervention to prop up the crown would be futile.
Czechs ""should take a lesson"" from the 1992 crash of the British pound when the Bank of England made a fruitless attempt to defend its currency against speculators, who ultimately forced the pound from the European exchange rate mechanism, he said.
""Essentially, (the Bank of England) lost a significant part of its reserves and had to devalue the pound or let the pound devalue anyway,"" Svejnar said.

JohnMastrini,"Volkswagen AG's Czech unit Skoda Automobilova a.s. said on Thursday that it should nearly double its worldwide production capacity, making half a million cars yearly by the end of the century.
At a news conference detailing last year's results -- which showed a swing to a small profit after a 1995 loss -- Chief Financial Officer Volkhard Kohler said the former communist car maker had laid the foundation for strong global expansion.
""The half million (cars produced yearly) volume is no Utopia for us, we are sure we can achieve that,"" he said.
""We have to globalise,"" said Kohler, who is to be re-assigned soon after helping lead Skoda's transformation.
Skoda posted 1996 net profit of 163 million crowns after a loss of 1.62 billion crowns in 1995, when it ploughed much of its cash flow into building a new mid-sized platform for its Octavia line which premiered last autumn.
""In the next and future years we don't count on any losses, only profits,"" said Kohler, declining a more specific forecast.
Skoda's total turnover comprised roughly 3.4 percent of Volkswagen Group's worldwide take in 1996. VW built up a 70 percent stake in the Czech company in 1995 since joining in on its privatisation earlier in the decade.
Officials said potential domestic production capacity would be filled when it reaches an expected 340,000 cars this year.
Expansion is to come from opening new production elsewhere, such as its assembly line in Poznan, Poland -- which has a capacity for 15,000 to 20,000 cars.
Total sales rose 34 percent last year to 58.9 billion crowns, while unit sales were up 24 percent to 279,363 cars, almost entirely comprised of Skoda's compact Felicia line.
Production is forecast to increase 30 percent this year, as the Octavia range comes fully on stream.
The century-old Skoda, based north of Prague, posted robust sales growth of 47 percent in developed countries of western Europe, which accounted for nearly a third of total turnover.
Meanwhile, sales to central and eastern Europe, excluding Skoda's home market, rose 78 percent, and domestic turnover was up 24 percent and comprised 45 percent of sales.
Sales and marketing director Detlef Wittig said that the company hoped to hold on to its 50 percent domestic market share while continuing to focus on Poland and Russia for growth and making gains in new western European markets.
""In highly developed Western markets we have broken through with the Felicia range,"" Wittig said, stressing that Skoda's marketing had concentrated on the new quality of the brand which was once the butt of many western jokes.
Unit sales in two of its largest western European export markets Germany and Britain showed growth of just two percent, but sales to France, Italy, and Denmark showed double-digit growth, and sales to nearby Austria doubled to 9,457 units.
Meanwhile it had a lower turnover in Asia and South America of 10 percent as it directed exports toward stronger demand in Europe. The company has yet to attack North America.
Despite average double-digit wage increases and Czech average annual inflation last year of 8.8 percent, personnel costs grew only 6.8 percent, as the workforce grew 6.9 percent to 17,992 employees.
Skoda exports account for roughly five percent of total Czech exports. Kohler said that further increases in productivity and efficiency would counter the strong Czech crown and increase Skoda's share to seven or eight percent.
""We can say that the ground floor (at Skoda) has already been finished, but it now depends on our colleagues to make a nice skyscraper,"" the outgoing Kohler said.

JohnMastrini,"Czech Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Rudlovcak, under heavy criticism for his management of capital markets, resigned on Thursday, his ministry said.
It said Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik had accepted Rudlovcak's resignation and named Jiri Spicka, director of the ministry's section on finance and banking, as his replacement.
Rudlovcak and the ministry have been criticised by investors and in the media for their performance in regulating funds and equities markets, which are frequently accused of being opaque and rife with insider trading.
In leaving, Rudlovcak was quoted by the ministry in a statement as saying that ""in the situation when there is a long-term strong media campaign against the Finance Ministry and himself especially... his continuation in the function of deputy minister would not be profitable"".
It said that the situation had been problematic ""especially for the activity of the (capital market) oversight, in which (Rudlovcak's) authority is continually eroded through the systematic attacks.""
Criticism of Rudlovcak intensified in recent weeks after several cases where Czech investment fund managers and major shareholders were found to have been stripping assets of the funds under the noses of regulators.
One case involved the investment fund Trend, in which a group of shareholders was arrested and charged with transferring major holdings out of the fund, including a major stake in the Prague department store Kotva a.s.
The arrests too place long after shares had been transferred and a group of minority shareholders is still fighting to get them back.
On Thursday, a representative of the Czech Value Fund, one of Trend's large minority shareholders which has put much of the blame for ignorance of the fund's stripped assets on the Finance Ministry, welcomed Rudlovcak's resignation.
""It's a positive sign of course. It shows that what we are working on here is having some effect,"" said John Moffitt of the Czech Value Fund, who leads a group of investors pushing for tighter regulation of the capital markets.
Another case involved the fund CS Fond in which managers were found to have drained more than a billion crowns ($34 million) of assets into personal accounts.
The ministry statement cited the CS Fond case specifically, saying that Rudlovcak and his staff did what it could within the framework of the law but it was up to other criminal justice bodies to resolve the case which had ""an unambiguous criminal character"".
Much of the frustration on Prague's share markets, which have consistently underperformed other post-communist markets in the region, has been aimed at the Finance Ministry.
Prague Stock Exchange Chairman Tomas Jezek, one of the most outspoken critics of Rudlovcak, is pushing for legislation to give power to a new independent watchdog fashioned on the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Jezek was not immediately available for comment after the ministry's announcement.
Jan Sykora, a broker at the Prague investment house Wood &amp; Co, commented : ""I think it's good news, because clearly there are a lot of things not going well in the capital markets and Rudlovcak was responsible for that (the capital markets).""

JohnMastrini,"Tremours rumbled through Czech markets on Monday, as crown, debt, and equity traders were anxious about the contents of a government pro-growth package due out mid-week.
The extent of budget cuts and measures affecting interest and exchange rates in the still-secret package -- aimed at stemming growing budget and trade deficits and reviving economic growth -- kept everybody in the markets guessing.
The Czech crown fell to a 10-month low, losing 1.5 percent of its value trading late on Monday at 30.283/dollar 17.568/mark or about 0.75 percent below parity with the peg, from 29.290 and 17.439, or +0.80 on Friday.
""I think we'll see much nervousness on the markets (until the cabinet's announcement) -- forex, equity, and fixed income,"" said Vladimir Kreidl at Prague's Patria Finance.
In thin activity on the Prague Stock Exchange, the blue-chip PX50 index dropped about 0.5 percent to 548.5.
""Probably now, the nervousness around the government measures is a little bit distracting,"" said Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings. The heaviest decliner among top shares was Komercni Banka, which fell 65 crowns, 2.8 percent, to 2,247.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and other senior ministers have suggested a series of budget cuts along with a loosening in monetary policy, but specific details have not been revealed.
The central bank responded last Thursday by easing minimum reserve requirements, but kept key interest rates unchanged.
The Czech National Bank fixed the crown on Monday at 30.045 and 17.439 or +0.04 percent above parity, as rates fluctuated wildly ahead of the daily fixing at 11.30 am (0930 gmt).
The sharp fall in the crown did not give a reason for the CNB to intervene to prop up its value, the CTK news agency quoted CNB spokesman Martin Svehla as saying late on Monday. Central bank officials were not available for further comment.
Traders are debating whether the central bank, as a complicit part of the plan to be announced on Wednesday, would let the crown depreciate to help a worsening trade situation.
The crown, which hit its high in February against the central bank's mark/dollar peg, has been especially sensitive as government pressure for an easing of monetary policy grows.
""Traders see the authorities as not opposing a weaker Czech crown, and the authorities are seeing the revaluation (side of the central bank's fixing) band, as overvalued,"" said Petr Korous, a trader at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.
Korous said comments by Prime Minister Klaus over the weekend, hinting he was not happy with the crown's higher exchange rate levels, added more uncertainty.
The government and the central bank have repeatedly ruled out a direct administrative devaluation of the crown in order to boost exports, although the country's current account deficit now is over eight percent of gross domestic product.
""I haven't seen the market this agitated since last September. When you see volatility like that, and it's across the board not just a few major players, that can be a bit of a problem,"" said one London-based analyst.
"
JohnMastrini,"A long-awaited early 1997 measure of Czech M2 money supply showed no signs of surfacing on Monday, causing traders and analysts who use the numbers for investment strategy to vent their frustrations.
""It's incredibly frustrating, because the Czech National Bank keeps referring to M2 as one of its most important statistics and it's consistently released very late,"" said Matt Starr, a fixed-income analyst at Creditanstalt in Prague.
While central banks of most major economies and many post-communist neighbours have already released key money supply figures for well into 1997, the Czech National Bank (CNB) has yet to publish any for the year.
The CNB said on Monday it still had no definite release date for January's M2 data, although the figures may come soon.
""Definitely not today. Maybe tomorrow or after tomorrow,"" Pavel Palivec, a CNB spokesman, told Reuters.
""No legal norms"" require a release of M2 data, he said, adding that slow reporting of commercial banks was partly to blame for the tardier-than-usual release.
Tension has grown ahead of the government's economic stimulus package on Wednesday, where some analysts believe that a rapid decline in M2 may enable the cabinet to succeed in pushing the central bank into lowering key interest rates.
""They (the CNB) may be waiting for political reasons, but it's putting a lot of people off,"" said one trader at the Prague office of a foreign bank.
Analysts are hoping to see end-February figures, although January data is more likely.
They say it is difficult to forecast privately and that much of the data included in the M2 calculation has long been at the central bank's disposal.
The CNB has never had a set release date for its key M2 figure, but in 1996 the lag time was usually around one-and-a- half to two-and-a-half months after the period being measured.
The last M2 release was on March 13, when the CNB said M2 at end-December was 7.8 percent higher than the same 1995 month. That was a slowing from November which showed a rise of 9.7 percent year-on-year.
November's results were released on January 23.
Analysts are watching M2 closely since growth in the money supply slowed from a double-digit rate last year ahead of central bank tightening measures in June.
The government has said a drop in March's 12-month inflation rate to 6.8 percent from nine percent for much of 1996 came at the cost of a slowdown in economic growth.
The criticism has kept many watching for a possible lowering of interest rates, monetary conditions permitting.
Creditanstalt's Starr said he expects the figures -- after an inflow of more than 30 billion crowns in crown Eurobonds in January -- might give the central bank less room to manoeuvre, helping its argument to keep rates higher.
""I actually think the M2 figure for January is going to be bad with all those Eurobonds they haven't been able to sterilise (pull out of circulation),"" Starr said.
Compared with other central banks, the CNB-published figures lag well behind:
* Germany's Bundesbank has a roughly three-day window around the 20th of each month to release its key M3 data for the preceding month.
* The U.S. Federal Reserve measures M2 weekly and releases the results within three to five days, adding up roughly $4 trillion circulating and saved in the U.S. economy.
* The neighbouring Polish central bank releases its broad money data for each month within 10 days after the end of the period measured. End-March data was released on April 9.

JohnMastrini,"The Czech cabinet will adopt a carrot-and-stick package mixing investment incentives with budget and import cuts in an attempt to spur economic growth, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday.
With the cabinet due to announce its ""package"" of stimulus measures on Wednesday, share market repairs and savings promotion steps to reduce demand were most frequently mentioned by the nine analysts as likely to be included.
The government said it aims to reduce growing budget and trade deficits, while spurring growth, dampening demand for imports and adding confidence to beleaguered capital markets.
None of the analysts expected a direct manipulation of the exchange rate to help exports, although several suggested allowing the crown to ease below its corridor of plus/minus 7.5 percent from the mid-point of a mark/dollar basket.
Josef Poeschl at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, said lower interest rates were needed, but Merrill Lynch's Andrew Kenningham expects lower rates would be put off until more data on slowing growth is available.
There was a consensus among the analysts that the cabinet should take steps to beef up market regulation with most saying a U.S.-style Securities and Exchange Commission would help bring back lagging foreign invesmtent.
The analysts agreed sharp budget cuts were on the cards, as economic growth, and thus tax revenue, has come up short.
Expectations ranged from 20 billion crowns in cuts seen as ""very likely"" by Boris Gomez and Susanne Hallergard at ING Barings, to 40-50 billion forecast by Kenningham.
""At least 25 billion crowns of cuts are needed to give good chance of a balanced budget,"" said Kennigham. ""Anything short of a balanced budget lacks credibility.""
There was a broad consensus that state sector wages would be capped at 10 percent nominal growth -- Kenningham said that should save about 30 billion crowns this year -- and several expect pressure on the private sector to follow suit.
Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka, said the government should seek a budget surplus of two to three percent of GDP, but more likely would move toward just a balance.
Janacek, who works at the largest state-controlled bank, said the government must finish privatising big banks and industrial corporations.
He said he expects the issuing of longer-term government bonds ""to increase the propensity to save in the household sector"" and for ""changes in legal and institutional framework enabling better functioning of the legal infrastructure"".
Several said they expected longer-term state bonds to be issued aimed at attracting individual Czech retail investors to park their money for awhile, reducing demand.
The group was mixed on the need to impose surcharges or quotas to reduce demand for imports which have thrown the current account deficit to more than 8.5 percent of GDP.
Gomez and Hallergard said they expected ""seasonal"" import duties ""on selected foodstuffs and more stringent non-tariff trade barriers on imports, particulary from EU"" in the package.
Poeschl said he expected some non-tariff barriers will be introduced on selected items and should be for a defined period of time, including plans for a gradual removal.
Other key comments included:
* Martin Kupka at Prague's Patria Finance said he expected ""considerable"" budget cuts, anti-import administrative measures and a rise in consumption taxes to dampen demand.
* Matt Starr, bond trader at Creditanstalt Prague, said he expected a cap on wages, budget cuts, a move to separate invesment funds from banks -- an often-repeated problem in the capital markets -- and more support for the Export Guarantee and Insurance agency (EGAP) and state export bank.

JohnMastrini,"The Czech cabinet will adopt a carrot-and-stick package mixing investment incentives with budget and import cuts in an attempt to spur economic growth, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday.
With the cabinet due to announce a stimulus package on Wednesday, share market reforms and savings promotion steps to reduce demand were most frequently mentioned as likely to be included by the nine analysts surveyed.
The government has said it aims to reduce growing budget and trade deficits, while spurring growth, dampening demand for imports and adding confidence to beleaguered capital markets.
None of the analysts expected a direct manipulation of the exchange rate to help exports, although several suggested allowing the crown to ease below its corridor of plus/minus 7.5 percent from the mid-point of a mark/dollar basket.
Josef Poeschl at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies said lower interest rates were needed, but Merrill Lynch's Andrew Kenningham expected lower rates would be put off until more data on slowing growth was available.
There was a consensus among the analysts that the cabinet should take steps to beef up market regulation, with most saying a U.S.-style Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would help revive lagging foreign investment.
The analysts agreed sharp budget cuts were on the cards, as economic growth, and thus tax revenue, has come up short.
Expectations ranged from 20 billion crowns ($654 million) in cuts seen as ""very likely"" by Boris Gomez and Susanne Hallergard at ING Barings to 40-50 billion forecast by Kenningham.
""At least 25 billion crowns of cuts are needed to give good chance of a balanced budget,"" said Kennigham. ""Anything short of a balanced budget lacks credibility.""
There was a broad consensus that state sector wages would be capped at 10 percent nominal growth -- Kenningham said that should save about 30 billion crowns this year -- and several expected pressure on the private sector to follow suit.
Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka, said the government should seek a budget surplus of two to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but more likely would move toward just a balance.
Janacek, who works at the largest state-controlled bank, said the government must finish privatising big banks and industrial corporations.
He said he expected the issuing of longer-term government bonds to increase the propensity to save in the household sector and for changes in the legal and institutional framework to enable better functioning of the legal infrastructure.

JohnMastrini,"The Czech government, central Europe's perennial budget hawk, says it will consider a plan next week to cut all ministries' spending in order to balance the 1996 budget by year's end.
The Finance Ministry is proposing cuts of roughly more than one percent from the 1996 budgets of every ministry, because of a projected 6.6 billion crown ($248 million) revenue shortfall and a 2.7 billion over-expenditure from the originally approved balanced budget.
""The total we need to cut is roughly 9.3 billion crowns,"" Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel told Reuters.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's government has been widely praised by financial analysts for passing four consecutive balanced budgets, earning him the reputation as post-Communist Europe's tightest fiscal manager.
Earlier, Klaus told a news conference after a cabinet meeting that the finance ministry plan would be on the agenda of next week's government session.
Deputy minister Havel said the cuts, would not affect pensions or civil service wages, but would be broad, not deep.
""(The cuts) will touch every ministry and in the same level -- the same percentage of reduction of several non-investment outlays. Certainly we're not cutting pensions or wages,"" said Havel, who directs budget planning for the ministry.
""But we are reducing such expenditures on materials and other things,"" he added.
Analysts said the Czech capital markets would welcome the move as it would keep billions of crown out of the bloated money supply which has already been fueling inflationary domestic demand.
""I would consider this to be a very positive move,"" said Jan Vlachy, vice-chariman at Prague's Patria Finance. ""This is basically the only way I could have imagined the government could have had an (immediate) impact on inflation.""
Domestic bond prices have been depressed of late after central bank moves to tighten the money supply in late June signalled inflation worries were strong.
Annual inflation has remained stubbornly around nine percent this year, above the eight percent the government projected by the year's end.
The budget cuts, if passed, would reduce the entire 1996 state budget to 291 billion crowns from the plan passed by parliament last December.
Havel said the revenue gap was mostly due to Russia's failure to pay about five billion crowns on loans owed to the Czech Republic.
The largest component of the over-expenditure was subsidies for heating because of the longer than expected cold weather and other social aid payments, he said.
""You know (the ministers) don't like cutting their budgets. But we're doing it because of the total macroeconomic situation,"" Havel said. ($1=26.63 Czech Crown)

JohnMastrini,"The Czech National Bank (CNB) on Tuesday put the largest fully-private bank, Agrobanka a.s., under forced administration due to liquidity problems arising from the failure of another bank, Kreditni Banka a.s..
The central bank, in its 12th intervention into a commercial bank in the post-Communist period, said it would guarantee all of Agrobanka's obligations during a ""temporary"" forced administration period of an unspecified duration.
Analysts said the move was another badly-needed step in reforming the banking sector and should speed up overall market reforms.
CNB Governor Josef Tosovsky on Tuesday said that the central bank instructed the ""big banks"" to prepare up to six billion crowns ($159 million) to help liqidity at Agrobanka, which has four billion crowns in basic capital.
Tosovsky did not elaborate on what form the liquidity help might take or from which source.
The ""Big Four"" banks are Ceska Sporitelna, Komercni Banka, Investicni a Postovni Banka and Ceskoslovensko Obchodni Banka a.s. (CSOB) -- all in which the state holds a significant stake. All but CSOB, have privately-held shares.
Tosovsky, who called Agrobanka's situation a problem with ""liquidity not solvency"" said the central bank would jump in with its own funds if necessary to help the central bank's ""precautionary measures"".
In a statement issued after an overnight meeting of the Czech cabinet, the CNB said that problems of Agrobanka, the country's fifth largest overall, had arisen as a consequence of the failure of the medium-sized Kreditni Banka a.s.
It also said the move stemmed from the investigation of people in the Kreditni case -- in which five people connected to Kreditni have been indicted on fraud charges -- who are also connected to Agrobanka.
""The investigation of the fall of Kreditni Banka...and its politicisation, and charges against people connected to Agrobanka, negatively influences the liquidity position of this bank (Agrobanka),"" the CNB said in its statement.
Over 70 percent of banking activity in the country is done within the four largest banks.
In order to support Agrobanka, the CNB said it would guarantee all deposits at the bank, and that it would ensure, in cooperation with other commercial banks, sufficient ""financial sources"" for Agrobanka, should it need them.
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the central bank's move was a preventative step aimed at keeping the banking sector sound. ""There isn't even the slightest reason for any sort of banking panic,"" Klaus told journalists on Tuesday.

While over 70 percent of banking activity in the country is down within the four largest banks -- each with the state as a major shareholder -- Agrobanka has grown to be the largest fully-private bank with four billion crowns ($151 million) in basic capital.
In order to support Agrobanka, the CNB said it would guarantee all deposits at the bank, and that it would ensure, in cooperation with other commercial banks, sufficient ""financial sources"" for Agrobanka, should it need them.

He said the move by the central bank is a way to stop problems in the banking sector escalating.
The fall in August of Kreditni, based in the western city of Plzen, caused a political furore and led local media to question the effectiveness of bank supervision.
Kreditni and Agrobanka were linked to each other through the secretive Czech investment group Motoinvest which used both banks to finance its securities operations.
An official from Motoinvest was indicted last weeekend for a debt swap scheme which police said led, in-part, to the failure of Kreditni Banka.
But Motoinvest has denied any responsibility for the failure of Kreditni which caused losses of about 12 billion crowns.

JohnMastrini,"The Czech cabinet appeared headed for a shakeup on Tuesday as Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's senior Civic Democratic Party (ODS) agreed to discuss changes with its two partners in the centre-right ruling coalition.
The leadership of ODS, after suffering weeks of harsh criticism and falling approval ratings amid Klaus's insistence that immediate personnel changes were not necessary, agreed to discuss a shuffling of the cabinet.
""(The leadership) expressed its agreement with the opening of debate on the reconstruction of the government also with our coalition partners,"" Klaus said in an interview on Czech Radio.
The Czech news agency CTK quoted ODS deputy chairman Miroslav Macek as saying that the cabinet changes should be completed by the end of June.
Later a government spokesman, Ivo Strejcek, told Reuters that leaders of the coalition parties might meet Tuesday afternoon or evening, but he said he could not say what would be discussed.
Klaus's government has come under fire in recent weeks for a slowdown in the country's economic performance and for highly publicised cases of financial crime, and problems in the health care sector and schools.
The macroeconomic problems -- mainly a current account deficit topping nine percent of gross domestic product and recent contractions in industrial output -- have prompted a sell-off of the country's currency, the crown.
Political instability has also added to the downward pressure on the currency. The central bank intervened on several occasions last week to stem the fall of the crown.
Opinion polls have shown that support for Klaus's centre-right ODS is at a record low while support for the opposition Social Democrats has grown well above that of the three parties in the ruling coalition.
Just 35 percent of respondents in a poll released on Monday said they trusted the government, down from 38 percent in April. A year ago 47 percent trusted the government.
Klaus last month announced a package of measures aimed at giving fresh impetus to economic growth, curbing trade and current account deficits and clamping down on economic crime. It included cuts in public spending and limits on wage growth.
""The ODS's declining popularity  probably also means that the public has not embraced the package of measures that the government recently announced in an effort to 'correct' negative economic developments,"" independent political analyst Jiri Pehe said.
""As the package was not accompanied by radical personal changes in the government is now backfiring--and, once again, affecting adversely mainly the ODS,"" he added.
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik was chiefly blamed for the country's problems in the poll on Monday, with 28 percent saying he should resign.
He was followed in the unpopularity stakes by Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, with 22 percent saying he should quit. Eighteen percent said Klaus should go.

JonathanBirt,"International business services group Rentokil Initial Plc announced sharp rises in 1996 sales and profits on Wednesday, but there were concerns that the group relied heavily on newly-acquired BET for progress.
Rentokil Initial, formed last year through Rentokil's hostile takeover of rival BET, said pre-tax profit jumped 48 percent to 318 million pounds ($505.8 million) while sales were up 168 percent at 2.34 billion pounds.
The dividend rose 20.5 percent to 5.06 pence per share.
The results were at the bottom end of analysts' forecasts of between 317 and 335 million pounds, and shares in the company fell sharply in morning trading, trading down 5.7 percent or 26 1/2 pence to 431 1/2 pence.
Rentokil Initial, whose services include office cleaning, personnel, security, pest control and supplying plants, also announced a two-for-one share split.
It said the integration of BET, bought for 2.1 billion pounds, ""had proceeded rapidly and successfully in line with plans.""
However, excluding BET, sales were up 15 percent and profits rose nine percent to 233.4 million pounds, raising concerns that the company would not have lived up to its long-established reputation for delivering year-on-year earnings and sales growth of 20 percent without BET.
One trader said ""they managed the 20 percent gain, although the contribution from BET is very substantial. People will be asking about their core businesses and wondering whether they would have made the grade without BET.""
The company said the results had been affected by 16.4 million pounds of integration costs, focusing of management effort on BET's integration and adverse exchange rates.
Chief executive Sir Clive Thompson said he did not expect the company to make any more large acquisitions for the next two years while it integrated the 52 BET operations.
""I'd be very suprised to see us making major acquisitions for certainly under two years, and if we were to do so it would indicate that we had integrated the businesses extremely well,"" Thompson said.
However, Thompson said there were opportunities for ""bolt-on acquisitions"" in the core businesses of hygiene and cleaning, pest control and security ""and I hope we'd be making those sorts of acquisitions.""
Thompson said he expected to make a number of low-key disposals of BET operations over the next year.
""In the short term you'd expect to see a series, quite a number, of relatively small-sized disposals. In total terms over the next 12 months it might approach 50 to 100 million (pounds),"" he said.

JonathanBirt,"Britain's biggest textiles group Coats Viyella Plc announced a sharp fall in 1996 pre-tax profits on Thursday, reflecting continuing tough market conditions and the costs of an extensive reorganisation.
Pre-tax profits fell 42 percent to 94.4 million pounds ($150.8 million) last year, with a previously-announced 54.9 million pound reorganisation charge accounting for a large chunk of the decline.
But even excluding charges, profits slid eight percent as several key divisions, including the core thread operations, struggled to cope with poor demand and economic weakness in important markets including Europe, Brazil and Turkey.
Despite the drop in earnings Coats Viyella held its dividend payout per share steady at the 1995 level of 8.8 pence, even though this was well ahead of the group's earnings per share of just 6.7 pence.
Shares in Coats, whose products range from bedlinen to precision engineering components for mobile phones, rose 4 1/2 pence to 134 1/2 in late morning trading.
Over the past two years the stock has fallen 52 percent and underperformed the FTSE All Share index by 48 percent, according to Reuters 3000 data. The stock is currently 84 percent below its 1988 peak of 860 pence.
Neville Bain, who announced his intention to step down as chief executive of the group in May after nearly seven years, told Reuters the dividend payment was ""a sign of strong confidence for 1997"".
""The company is well placed to move ahead in 1997 and future years, although the extent of that does depend on some factors outside our control,"" including exchange rates and economic trends, said Bain.
Joining the growing chorus of complaints from British industry about the strong pound, Coats said the current level of sterling against the dollar could wipe between five and eight million pounds off pre-tax profits in 1997, while weak European currencies could hurt the competitiveness of British manufacturing.
A year ago the group announced a wide-ranging restructuring plan aimed at cutting costs and raising productivity, centred on the clothing, thread and home furnishings operations.
Bain said savings from the reorganisation were coming through faster than expected, with 12 million pounds notched up in 1996 and annual savings of at least 35 million anticipated by 1998.
The group's thread operations, which account for more than 40 percent of sales and over 50 percent of operating profit, reported a 10 percent slide in profits to 90.3 million pounds last year. Bain said the division, which supplies yarn and thread to the clothing, footwear and car industries, had seen a pick up in the last quarter.
Disruption from reorganising the clothing operation, which is a major supplier of Marks &amp; Spencer Plc, helped profits to fall 12 percent to 19.1 million pounds. Profits also fell at precision engineering, where volatile consumer electronics and automobile markets undermined strong sales growth.
An upturn in Britain's housing market helped to boost the home furnishings division, where operating profits rose 42 percent to 12.5 million pounds. Fashion retail, which includes the Jaeger and Viyella brands, also saw a solid performance.
Bain is to be replaced at the top by former McKechnie Plc chief executive Michael Ost, who is 52. ""We agreed at the end of last year that this would be a good time to go,"" Bain said.

JonathanBirt,"British textiles group Coats Viyella Plc is ""well placed"" for a recovery in profitablity, its retiring chief executive Neville Bain said on Thursday.
Bain told Reuters in an interview following publication of results that showed a sharp fall in 1996 profits: ""We are poised for a period of growth from the base we have put in place."" He added, ""The company is well placed to move ahead in 1997 and future years, although the extent of that does depend on some factors outside our control,"" including exchange rates and economic trends.  
Bain said he felt now was the right time to stand down as chief executive after 6-1/2 years, and added that he hoped to take up other directorships and chairmanships.
""We agreed at the end of last year that this would be a good time to go,"" Bain said.
He said he would continue to be available to assist Coats Viyella. Bain said his successor, former McKechnie Plc chief executive Michael Ost, ""has a very good track record, and he did not expect him to change the group's strategy.  
""This year's results, in difficult circumstances, are exactly in line with expectations and the trading statement that we made at the end of last year,"" said Bain. ""Underlying profit is down by seven percent, which is a tad disappointing, but given the state of this industry that certainly would augur well in (comparison with) our peer group.""
Bain said cost savings from the group's reorganisation, which led to charges of 54.9 million stg against 1996 profits, were flowing through faster than expected. Savings in 1996 totalled 12 million pounds against a prediction of 10 million stg.  
Bain said he was ""confident"" that savings of at least 35 million stg would be achieved in 1998.
He highlighted the performance of the group's home furnishings division, where operating profits rose 42 percent to 12.5 mllion stg, and the continued strength of fashion retail, which he said had built profits to 13.1 million stg in 1996 from around 2.0 million over the past five years.
But he said the performance of clothing, where profits fell 12 percent to 19.1 million stg, ""was not satisfactory."" He said the division had been affected by disruption from restructuring, which involves relocation of a number of operations.  
Bain said he was confident management ""is doing the right things to secure greater profits into the future, but it is taking us a bit longer than anticipated."" He added that group was looking for a ""significant improvement"" on the division's profit margins of between three and four percent.
The core threads division, where operating profits fell 10.4 percent to 90.3 million stg, had enjoyed a stronger fourth quarter after a weak first half, Bain said.

JonathanBirt,"Shares in one of Britain's best-performing biotechnology stocks plunged on Friday after it announced that some trials linked to its main product could have been mishandled.
Scottish-based Shield Diagnostics Group Plc said parts of a U.S. clinical trial which it hopes will help prove that it has a blockbuster heart attack predictor on its hands had been mishandled and could produce ""misleading conclusions.""
Shares in Shield dropped 140 pence to 665 pence on the news. The stock had hit an all time high of 928 pence just ahead of the announcement, a gain of more than 560 percent since the start of the year.
The company is developing a diagnostic test for a blood-clotting agent, known as Activated Factor Twelve (AFT), which it hopes will be a much more accurate predictor of the likelihood of coronary heart disease and heart attacks than cholesterol levels.
Some analysts believe that the test is a potential blockbuster, which could easily overtake the $500 million a year spent on cholesterol tests.
Shield has been waiting for publication of a number of long-running surveys which are tracking the incidence of heart attacks and trying to establish links with different factors in the blood, including AFT.
A doctor involved in one major trial, the U.S. ARIC study, which has taken regular blood samples from 16,000 people over more than ten years, wrote to Shield on Thursday to say mishandling and storage of early blood samples could distort analysis of the results.
In an interview with Reuters, Shield's technical director Peter Foster said the company still expected to have test kits on the market this year.
""We don't see it as a problem at all and we will continue with our timetable for the commercialisation of the test,"" Foster said.
He said data from a British study of 3,000 individuals by researchers based at St Bartholomew's hospital in London ""is there and getting stronger."" Initial results from the St Bartholomew study published on February 21 added to ""the body of consistent positive data from a number of clinical sites"" which back the link between AFT and heart disease, Shield said.
At least one analyst however criticised the company for allowing its share price to race ahead when ""they don't even know if the product correlates to a use that a regulatory authority would approve.""
Thomas Geimer, biotechnology analyst at Henry Cooke Lumsden, added that ""the product may be valid and be fine,"" but he said the problems with the U.S. trial showed the need for investors to be ""very selective in this market.""

JonathanBirt,"Specialty chemicals and minerals group English China Clays Plc (ECC) chief executive Dennis Rediker said on Monday the group had had ""a fairly horrible year"" in 1996, but was now placed to rebuild profitability.
In a telephone interview with Reuters, Rediker said ""we have got a good understanding of the fundamentals of the business and put a management team in place that can take us to the next level of performance.""  
Predicting a return to profitability in the first half of 1997 after posting a pre-tax loss of 42.9 million stg last year, Rediker also pledged to restore and improve on the group's historic margins in the core paper mineral and specialty chemicals operations.
He said management had ""positioned the company to be able to have normal growth prospects,"" adding that ""the proof will be in the pudding.""
ECC, which provides kaolin and carbonates to paper manufacturers, said it was affected by ""a background of severe volume decline in the paper market and the lowest point in the turnaround of the specialty chemicals business.""  
Rediker said that profit margins in the European minerals business ""held through 1996"" with a strong recovery in the second half bringing the overall profit margin to 12.4 percent from 14.3 percent a year before. Operating profit fell 20 percent to 50 million stg.
However, weak paper markets and increased investments saw operating margins at the Americas/Pacific business drop 49 percent to $30.8 million, with profit margins dropping to 6.5 percent from 12.4 percent.  
Although he declined to give margin targets for the businesses, Rediker noted that ""in the past we have had margins in the 12 to 18 percent range for Europe and nine to 13 percent for Americas/Pacific.""
ECC is having to adjust to a switch from using higher margin kaolin, its main product, to lower margin calcium carbonates in paper production. Rediker said demand for kaolin for paper is likely to grow at only ""one percent a year,"" although ""it should be cash generative.""
Rediker said other performance minerals for paints, ceramics and plastics had ""good growth prospects.""  
In specialty chemicals, whose customers also include the paper industry, operating profits fell 57 percent to $7.0 million, with profit margins declining to 2.5 percent from 6.0 percent.
Rediker said the business had been in decline ""from 1995 to the middle of 1996."" He added: ""we have replaced all the management in that business and it is on a good trajectory.""
Rediker said his aim was ""to achieve industry norms in 1998,"" targeting profit margins of between 10 and 15 percent, which would exceed the division's previous best-ever performance of eight to nine percent.  
There has been speculation that ECC would sell the non-paper activities of its specialty chemicals operation Calgon.
Rediker said new managers at Calgon ""were being effective at turning that around, and added that ""all options"" for its future were being looked at.
ECC said it was ""likely"" that 1996 marked the low point in its trading cycle. It said there had been some weakness in paper markets for minerals worldwide, but noted ""a significant recovery"" of mineral volumes to the north American paper industry.
A combined approach to selling minerals and chemicals to the paper industry was also helping to gain business, and the outlook for the performance minerals business was ""encouraging,"" ECC said.

JonathanBirt,"British chemicals group Albright &amp; Wilson Plc said on Thursday that it planned to focus its business increasingly on emerging markets, with particular emphasis on South America, China and India.
""These are very important for the growth of Albright &amp; Wilson,"" chief executive Robin Paul told Reuters in an interview.
Paul, who steered the company back onto the stock market in 1995 after 17 years as part of Tenneco Inc, said expansion was likely to come through partnerships and the acquisition of majority stakes in partner companies where appropriate.
Last year Albright &amp; Wilson took a majority stake in an Indian partner, and is now stepping up its activities in phosphates and surfactants there. The company, which announced a 13.6 percent rise in 1996 pre-tax profits, also said it had appointed Gabriel Kow as president of its Asia Pacific operations. Kow joins the group from Glaxo Wellcome Plc.
""We continue to believe China is a very important region for Albright &amp; Wilson,"" said Paul, who said Kow had ""a very good understanding of China and its markets.""  
The company said 1996 produced ""a satisfactory result in an environment that has offered little assistance in the various markets in which the group operates."" Paul said rises in raw material prices, which added 40 million stg to costs in 1995, had stabilised, with just four million stg added to costs last year.
In the key phosphates business, which goes into products ranging from soft drinks to washing powders, sales rose eight percent to 361.1 million stg, including associate companies, but operating profits fell 7.5 percent to 47.0 million stg, with margins down to 13.0 percent from 15.2 percent.  
Albright &amp; Wilson is the world's largest producer of wet phophoric acid. Paul said phosphates had been affected by ""a number of special factors"" in 1996, including higher Chinese phosphorus prices and costs and distortions linked to capacity increases and refurbishment of plants in England and Mexico.
""These factors are largely behind us,"" said Paul. ""Chinese phosphorous prices have started to come down compared to the middle of 1996."" Demand was strong: ""We are sold out in phosphates,"" he said.  
Paul said promised progress had been made in both the surfactants business, which supplies wetting and foaming agents for items like toiletries and detergents, and in specialty chemicals, whose products include flame retardants and chemicals for water treatment.
At surfactants operating profits leaped 76 percent to 14.1 million stg last year on sales of 309.0 million stg, with margins rising to 4.6 percent from 2.5 percent. Paul said the division was on target to achieve margins of between six and eight percent ""by the end of this year.""
At Specialties, where the group is targeting margins of 15 percent, operating profits rose 33 percent to 16.9 million stg on sales of 187.5 million, with margins improving to 9.0 percent from 6.6 percent.
Paul said the strength of sterling had little impact on 1996 results. In 1997 Paul noted that ""some people are talking about a 10 percent (impact) on profits if these rates continue for the whole year,"" but he added that this did not take into account the company's efforts to contain costs and a beneficial impact from lower raw material prices.
The chief executive said the group was slightly ahead on its goal of generating 20 percent of sales from new products by 1998, noting the successful launch of a biocidem Tolcide THPS, during 1996.
Paul, who retires from the board in July, said the company wanted to ""keep the option"" of buying back shares. However he added ""we believe we'll have other opportunites to use the strong balance sheet and cash flow rather than buying back shares, but we'll keep it under review.""

JonathanBirt,"British engineering group Charter Plc made an agreed 378 million pound ($602.1 million) bid for the world's largest industrial ventilation and fan supplier Howden Group Plc on Friday, ending days of speculation.
Shares in Howden, which also supplied drilling and boring equipment for the Channel Tunnel, began to climb on Monday after news of a possible bid leaked into the press, forcing Charter to declare its hand privately to Howden's board.
Charter's offer values the Scottish company's shares at 128.5 pence each, which Charter said was 54 percent above Howden's closing price on March 14th, the last trading day before bid speculation seeped into the market, and 40 percent above Thursday's closing price of 91.5 pence.
Charter is paying 124.78 pounds in cash and offering three new Charter shares for every 115 Howden shares held. The company said it would issue around 7 1/2 million new shares as a result of the deal.
Charter chairman and chief executive Jeffrey Herbert, who has transformed the group from a mining-focused business to the world's leading welding company in the past three years, said Howden fitted his aim of having ""three strong manufacturing businesses that are market leaders and this will be the basis of Charter's future growth.""
The acquisition would lift Charter into a new league internationally, boosting its annual sales by nearly 60 percent to around 1.4 billion pounds. Shares in the company jumped eight percent, or 62 1/2 pence, to 847 1/2 as analysts welcomed the move, while Howden shares rose 35 pence to 128 pence.
Charter, which changed its name from Charter Consolidated in 1993, is now centred on the welding products operation Esab, which it bought in 1994 for 445 million pounds. Its second business is the Pandrol rail track equipment operation based in Britain and the U.S.
Herbert made clear that Howden's world-leading fan, pump and ventilation division, which makes fans up to 17 feet in diameter for industrial use including mines and tunnels, was Charter's prime target.
""The company has one gorgeous centre,"" said Herbert, ""which is the Air and Gas Handling business."" The division, which also makes cooling systems for aircraft and tanks, made operating profits of 26.6 million pounds in the year to April 1996 on sales of 328 million pounds, accounting for 72 percent of Howden's total operating profit and 69 percent of turnover.
Herbert said the other two divisions, which make drilling and boring equipment and packaging and handling equipment, would have to justify their value to shareholders and could be sold.
Charter believes Howden will enhance its earnings in the first full year of ownership. Herbert said his goal was to drive Howden's profit margins, which at 7.9 percent lag Charter's 10.5 percent, up to the level of its closest competitors, which are forty to fifty percent higher.
In its central ventilation operations, Howden's main global rivals are ABB Flakt of Sweden and Germany's Deutsche Babcock AG.
""Margins at Esab have improved two-and-a-half times since we acquired it,"" said Herbert. ""Charter today is about world market-leading businesses, quite simply because market leaders earn larger margins than market followers. Howden is an exception because as a world leader it earns smaller margins than its competitors."" ($ = 0.627 British Pounds)

JonathanBirt,"Tiny Scottish research company Shield Diagnostics Plc said on Monday it had moved closer to marketing a potentially world-beating test for predicting heart attacks and coronary heart disease.
Shield said studies showed that patients with coronary heart disease had 30 percent higher levels of a key clotting agent, Activated Factor Twelve (AFT), in their blood than healthy people.
Dundee-based Shield has developed the only known test for AFT, the first element in a cascade of reactions in the blood which can eventually result in heart attacks and heart disease.
It believes this will prove a much more accurate indicator of both conditions than the 500 million pounds worth of cholesterol tests taken every year.
Shares in Shield closed 40 pence higher at 690 pence, to show a net gain of 393 percent since the start of the year.
However, they continued to trade below the all-time peak of 928 pence reached just before news of problems with a patient-monitoring trial in the United States unnerved some investors on March 14.
The company says problems with the U.S. trial, which has monitored incidence of heart atacks in 16,000 people for more than a decade, would not affect the timetable for launching a general screening test and a simple test kit for use in doctor's surgeries.
Shield said it planned to make the test itself and then license it out on a semi-exclusive basis to large diagnostic companies and to drug companies who would use it to promote their products.
Talks with diagnostics companies, believed to include Abbott Laboratories Inc, are already under way.
Shield declined to predict sales for the test but said it could save health services and insurers hundreds of millions of pounds a year through earlier detection and prevention.
Chief executive officer Gordon Hall said caring for patients with cardiac disase in the United States alone cost $151 billion a year, including $118 billion on hospital care.
""Any process than can reduce this figure must be highly attractive to healthcare providers ...if five percent of cases were detected earlier and prevented, then over $7.5 billion could be saved,"" Hall said.
For now Shield is more than content to have its eye not just on the 500 million pound annual cholesterol test market but on a further 380 million pounds spent on other tests related to cardiovascular disease.
Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum, a long-standing supporter of Shield, said he calculates that every one percent gain in Shield's share of the cholesterol testing market is worth 60 million pounds on its market capitalization. Even after its price surge this year, the group is worth around 130 million pounds.
However, Shield continued to try to dampen more feverish expectations about the test's prospects on Monday.
""All we can say is that if you have high AFT, you are a high risk (of a heart attack),"" said technical director Peter Foster. ""We can't say that if you have low AFT there is no risk -- there may be other reasons (for a heart attack).""
Shield's caution may also stem from press and market criticism in recent week of the way it has handled news about the product.
One industry specialist said many investors had not been getting a straight story on the AFT test, leading to the share's underperformance last year.
The company ran into trouble in January when it published a newsletter on AFT which was not initially sent to the stock exchange. The newsletter sparked a sharp rise in the group's share price.

JonathanBirt,"British drug discovery group Scotia Holdings Plc said on Tuesday it remained confident about prospects for its drug pipeline despite recent setbacks.
In a telephone interview with Reuters, chief executive David Horrobin said the company believed troubled diabetic drug Tarabetic would win approval in Britain, despite a formal rejection by the UK's Medicines Control Agency.
""We are internally confident that we have the evidence to respond to the MCA's concerns,"" said Horrobin.  
He said he also believed the drug would not have to be marketed with a weakened labelling indication for its use, as some analysts have suggested. ""It will be some variation of nerve damage in diabetes,"" he said.
The MCA's rejection of Tarabetic sent shares in Scotia plunging earlier this month, amid fears that the group would be forced into a rights issue in unfavourable circumstances.
But Horrobin also told Reuters that Scotia would not resort to a rights issue before the end of 1997 or 1998 at the earliest, helping take some pressure off the shares, which rose 36 pence to 415 by midmorning, recovering from early losses.  
He said trials of Foscan, currently in Phase III trials in Europe for head and neck cancer, were going well, with 250 patients recruited compared with 115 a year ago.
""We are getting the same results as you would get with surgical excision of early stage cancer,"" he said.
Horrobin also said the company was excited about Amelorad, a drug for alleviating the effects of radiation therapy on the skin and red blood cells.
""The one-year data is considerably stronger than the six to 12 week data, and shows substantial reductions in skin damage"" in breast cancer, Horrobin said.

JonathanBirt,"Britain's Courtaulds Plc has set its sights well beyond the troubled viscose business, putting its faith in its new wonder-fibre Tencel, industrial coatings and plastic packaging.
Chief executive Gordon Campbell told Reuters on Wednesday that viscose and acrylics would account for a dwindling portion of sales in coming years as its other businesses expanded.
Campbell was speaking in his first major interview since taking the helm at the international chemicals group last July.
Courtaulds, which was the first company to produce a manmade fibre commercially in 1905, has suffered from a slump in demand for viscose because of changing fashions and increased competition from Asian producers.
Worries about viscose have weighed on its share price, helping force it out of the FTSE 100 last December.
Courtaulds shares, which closed at 363 1/2 pence on Wednesday, have fallen 35 percent from their 12-month high of 490 pence touched in October last year, according to Reuters 3000 data.
Campbell said there were tentative signs of a recovery in viscose. ""But it is from such a lousy base, I'm not really celebrating,"" he said.
Last month the group closed 20 percent of its European viscose capacity, switching workers to a new plant for Tencel under construction at Grimsby in northern England.
Heavy investment in Tencel, a fibre derived from woodpulp which has attracted the attention of designers like Jean Paul Gaultier, Gianfranco Ferre and Christian Lacroix, is a cornerstone of Courtauld's growth strategy.
The company can sell every inch of the highly flexible fibre it can produce, and Campbell said sales should be close to $500 million a year by the end of the century.
But this would still be less than 10 percent of total sales. ""We have to keep reminding people that we have growth prospects in areas other than Tencel, and that people don't think that Courtaulds is a combination of Tencel and viscose,"" he said. ""It is Tencel, coatings and polymer products, all of which are capable of growing.""
Campbell's other goals include lifting sales in Asia by 10 percent a year, raising sales at Coatings by five percent a year and doubling the proportion of sales derived from the packaging-oriented Polymer business to make it ""a significant third leg"" for Courtaulds.
Campbell said growth in Asia would be led by Coatings, where Courtaulds had world-leading positions in marine and yacht paints, visible on the P&amp;O luxury liner Oriana, and in aerospace sealants. It is also a major producer of powder coatings for consumer goods.
Despite a third of Courtauld's production capacity lying in continental Europe, Campbell backed a warning by Barclays Plc chief executive Martin Taylor about the dangers of Britain joining a single currency too soon.
""If you go in at the wrong rate then it could be a very serious long-term problem for Britain,"" Campbell said.
He said the argument over a single currency was a ""stalking horse for the real debate"" which was about political union.
"
JonathanBirt,"International chemicals group Courtaulds Plc said on Wednesday that its wonder-fibre Tencel, global coatings business and fast-growing plastic packaging operations would spearhead expansion in the coming years.
In his first major interview since taking the helm last July, chief executive Gordon Campbell laid out his plans for the group, including an increasing focus on fast-growing Asian markets and a determination to move on from its historic role as a major producer of viscose fibres.  
He also told Reuters that Courtaulds would play its part in the current global restructuring of the specialty chemicals business through asset swaps, joint ventures and possibly acquisitions.
He said Courtaulds was set on expanding Tencel, a highly flexible fibre derived from wood pulp, ""as fast and as profitably as we can"", with annual sales seen approaching $500 million by the turn of the century.  
But he added: ""We have to keep reminding people that we have growth prospects in areas other than Tencel, and that people don't think that Courtaulds is a combination of Tencel and viscose. It is Tencel, coatings and polymer products, all of which are capable of growing.""
Campbell's other goals include lifting the group's sales in Asia by 10 percent a year, raising sales at Coatings by five percent a year and doubling the proportion of sales derived from the packaging-oriented Polymer business to make it ""a significant third leg"" for Courtaulds.  
Campbell said growth in Asia would be led by the Coatings business, where Courtaulds had world-leading positions in marine and yacht paints, visible on the P&amp;O luxury liner Oriana, and in aerospace sealants. It is also a major producer of powder coatings for consumer goods.
""Marine is always the bridgehead into developing markets, because it is such a well-known and internationally-recognised brand... then we backfill behind that with our other coatings products,"" he said.  
Campbell said the company had enjoyed annual sales growth in Asia of 15 to 20 percent over the past five years. ""The only reason I scaled it down to 10 percent (as a target) was because it is more difficult to grow at that rate from a bigger base,"" he added.
Polymers, whose products include toiletry and toothpaste packaging for giants like Unilever Plc and Colgate-Palmolive Co, accounted for less than 10 percent of Courtaulds' 2.30 billion stg sales in the year to March 1996, compared with nearly 50 percent for Coatings and 40 percent for fibres.  
""We ought to see it at least doubling over a period of time...Over five years might not be a bad period,"" said Campbell. He said growth would be largely organic, although Courtaulds would be interested in ""small, strategically useful acquisitions"" which expanded product range or geographic spread.
Campbell said the company was in negotiations with a number of countries in the Far East over the siting of a new production plant for Tencel, which will supplement factories in Alabama in the U.S, and Grimsby, England. He would not be drawn on the timing of an announcement.
""Various countries are attempting to attract us. We have three criteria: closeness to the market, country infrastructure ranging from political stability to whether the electricity supply is reliable...and financial incentives.""
He said the costs of investing in Tencel will spark ""a fairly sharp increase in gearing this year, but not to a level we feel concerned about"".
He added that ""the real measure"" is interest cover, which is currently around five times. ""We expect to be able to hold it at that,"" Campbell said.

JonathanBirt,"Textiles group Coats Viyella Plc, reporting lower first-half results, said on Wednesday it is confident it is on course for a bounce back to profit growth in 1997 as it puts a restructuring behind it.
The first 17.2 million pound chunk of reorganisation costs announced in March caused first-half pretax profit to tumble 34 percent to 47 million pounds ($73.09 million), with the remaining 38 million pounds of costs all to be charged against second-half earnings.
Chief executive Neville Bain told Reuters that ""charges will be taken this year so 1997 will be put on a clean basis going forward"" and predicted ""a good return to profit"" next year.
The announcement from Coats, whose products range from bath towels to precision engineering components, ended uncertainty about how the charges would fall.
An upbeat statement about prospects in key markets, in contrast with the gloomier tone of some competitors, helped to boost Coats' shares by 4-1/2 pence to 164 pence by late morning.
Bain said he is confident the group will achieve its cumulative annual cost saving targets of 10 million pounds in the second half of 1996, 25 million pounds in 1997 and 35 million in 1998.
But he said not all of this will reach the bottom line as the group spends money shifting an increasing amount of clothing production to lower-cost areas such as Morocco, eastern Europe and parts of Asia.
The reorganisation involves shedding 7,750 jobs, including nearly 3,000 in Britain.
Rival Courtaulds Textiles Plc announced on Tuesday that it is belatedly following Coats' lead in looking abroad to tackle continued margin pressures.
Coats' first-half operating profits on continuing operations slipped to 78.0 million pounds from 87.3 million, largely due to declines at its threads division, which produces thread for sewing and knitting and is the world's second-biggest zipper maker.
Bain said the decline was ""largely due to Brazil and Turkey in the first-half of 1995 having exceptional levels of profits. We said at the time that was unsustainable.""
Coats expects a ""worthwhile"" improvement in second-half results year-on-year before charges, with the key September to December period accounting for half its annual profits.
It said trading conditions ""appear to be showing some signs of improvement"", with a return of consumer confidence in Britain and normal weather patterns expected to help the second-half.
Bain said there was continued progress at its Jaeger and Viyella fashion retail chains, and the group's home furnishings business is struggling to keep up with demand caused by a ""substantial"" pick-up in the British housing market.
""The USA is picking up and we think it will good to us, especially in threads and engineering,"" Bain added, while demand in the rest of Europe is expected to remain mixed. ($1=.6430 Pound)

JonathanBirt,"Drug discovery company Chiroscience Group Plc said on Monday that its research alliance with ophthalmic specialist Alcon Laboratories Inc would allow it to test its leading drug programmes in a new therapeutic area.
In a telephone interview with Reuters, chief executive John Padfield said the link with the Nestle SA unit would also give Chiroscience access to Alcon's skills in rapid screening of potential new drugs.
Earlier the company said Alcon would put Chiroscience's library of compounds through its own high-intensity biological test system, retaining rights to develop any ophthalmic and optic drugs that resulted. Alcon is one of the world's biggest eyecare companies, making contact lenses and solutions as well as prescription drugs.
""Ophthalmology is an area of growing importance,"" Padfield said, which was likely to benefit from ageing populations in the developed world and increasing expenditure in developing countries. He said it was also a ""niche area"" with very few competitors.
Padfield said the programme with Alcon would focus on Chiroscience's work in MMP inhibitors, PNP inhibitors and PDE IV inhibitors.
Chiroscience is working on drugs for arthritis and cancer using MMP inhibitors, but Padfield said these may also prove useful in areas like corneal ulceration and recovery from eye surgery because of the role they played in healing wounds.
Padfield told Reuters that the group's lower profile work on inhibiting another class of enzyme, PNPs, could also receive a boost, with potential in corneal transplantation. Padfield said initial results suggested that PNP inhibitors could be more effective in helping prevent rejection of transplants than the current lead drug, cyclosporine, marketed by Novartis AG as Sandimmum.
A third major part of Chiroscience's novel drug programme involving the PDE IV enzyme, which is implicated in major inflammatory diseases like asthma and arthritis, could also be extended to inflammatory diseases of the eye.
Padfield said the agreement did not extend to the genetic research being conducted by Darwin Molecular Corp, the Seattle-based biotech company which Chiroscience bought in November 1996. But he noted work done by Alcon and the University of Iowa on isolating a gene linked to glaucoma, and said the two companies will ""be able to talk about what we have in Seattle.""
Padfield said access to Alcon's rapid-screening skills for new drugs would ""offset some of the need to invest"" in new technology. Chiroscience will have rights to all non-ophthalmic discoveries made through the alliance.
Padfield declined to disclose financial details of the arrangement, but said ""most of the money"" would come from product royalties and milestone payments. ""There is a bit of cash up front,"" he added.
Shares in Chiroscience were up 7 pence at 371 in early afternoon trading.

JonathanBirt,"Britain's chemical industry predicted another three years of sluggish investment on Wednesday despite relatively strong market conditions, adding to worries about the country's investment record.
The Chemical Industries Association (CIA) said spending on new plant and equipment was barely changed last year at 2.15 billion pounds ($3.5 billion), and after taking inflation into account it actually fell by 0.6 percent.
This put Britain well behind its international competitors. Spending by French chemical companies rose seven percent last year, with U.S. spending rising 11 percent and the Netherlands by 13 percent.
The CIA said the outlook for 1997 was little better, with spending seen rising only five percent.
The downbeat forecasts contrasted with positive predictions about economic growth and future production levels, with chemicals output expected to grow by three percent this year and exports by five percent.
Nikko Europe analyst Philip Morrish told Reuters that global overcapacity in the industry and weak European economies were major factors behind lacklustre investment.
""The industry may also be hedging its bets about whether we are getting close to the peak of the (demand) cycle globally, and I think more importantly we have seen the industry making much better use of its plant and equipment,"" he added.
But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said weak investment levels were reflected across the British economy.
Douglas Godden, head of the CBI's economic policy group, told the CIA's investment intentions conference that business investment had staged a relatively weak recovery compared both with in the early 1980s and with some other countries, notably Japan, the United States and the Netherlands.
""Manufacturing investment has lagged even further in the last year or so, with companies' own investment intentions not being fulfilled,"" Godden said.
CIA director-general Elliot Finer said investment by the chemicals industry had been weak for four years in a row, despite strengthening economic growth and an excellent business climate.
""We must look for other explanations of this subdued business climate,"" Finer told the conference. ""One factor is likely to be uncertainties about the UK's future membership of EMU.""
Finer called for a delay in starting European economic and monetary union (EMU) to allow time for genuine economic convergence. But he said Britain had to be involved from the beginning if it was not to lose out on both domestic and overseas investment.
His call, which is unlikely to be heeded by the Labour or Conservative parties currently vying for power in the May 1 election, was backed by Chris Andrews, who heads the British arm of French chemicals group Rhone Poulenc SA.
Andrews said a major part of his time was spent trying to win investment for Britain. ""I get the impression talking to many French colleagues that uncertainty about the UK position on EMU is worrying them, and can only act as some kind of discouragement to investment in the future,"" Andrews said.

JonathanBirt,"Promising trial results published on Wednesday on a new drug for treating Hepatitis B have raised hopes that Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc may have another big seller on its hands.
The pharmaceuticals giant, whose best-selling ulcer drug Zantac is expected to be eaten up by generic competition later this year, said advanced studies showed that Lamivudine may reduce and even reverse damage to the liver caused by the Hepatitis B virus.
Shares in Glaxo Wellcome, which licensed Lamivudine from Canada's BioChem Pharma Inc in 1990, climbed 23 1/2 pence to 11.13 pounds ($18.04) in early afternoon trading.
Lamivudine is also the base for Glaxo Wellcome's increasingly successful AIDS drug Epivir. But analysts said questions remained about how effective Lamivudine would be with Hepatitis B, with detailed results from several other studies not expected until the end of the year.
However, any advance would be a breakthrough against a virus which doctors say is 100 times more infectious than AIDS and kills two million people every year.
The World Health Organisation estimates that 350 million people carry the virus worldwide. Passed on in a variety of ways including unprotected sex, drug use, contact sports and from mother to baby, it can lead to severe liver scarring and is responsible for 80 percent of cases of liver cancer.
In a ground-breaking move Glaxo Wellcome plans to file its first regulatory approval for the drug in Asia later this year rather than in Europe or the United States, reflecting the prevalence of Hepatitis B in the region.
Glaxo Wellcome told the European Association for the Study of the Liver on Wednesday that phase III tests of Lamivudine on 358 people with chronic Hepatitis B in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong were ""extremely encouraging"".
It said 67 percent of patients who took a 100 milligram Lamivudine tablet every day for a year saw the condition of their liver improve compared with 30 percent who took a placebo. The number of people whose liver deteriorated was greatly reduced.
It also found that 16 percent of people taking the drug managed to stop the Hepatitis B virus from replicating in the blood compared with four percent who took a placebo.
More than 95 percent of Hepatitis B cases are estimated to be in the developing world. Authorities in China said last year that 120 million Chinese were affected by the condition and about 40 percent of these were pregnant women. Glaxo Wellcome said it had already held talks with the Chinese government on making the drug available there.
A spokesman said Lamivudine would also fit in with the group's strategy of becoming more focused on different regions, partly in recognition of the huge growth potential for pharmaceuticals and health care in regions such as Asia and South America.
But analysts said Lamivudine's focus on poorer countries made the issue of pricing the drug difficult to predict. It also raised the question of creating different pricing policies for rich and poor countries, a controversial move which Glaxo Wellcome is known to want to explore.
One analyst said sales estimates ranged from a couple of hundred million pounds a year to a billion pounds, reflecting uncertainty about how the drug will be marketed.
""From a scientific point of view this is a very exciting prospect (but) in commercial terms there remain questions on its sales prospects,"" he said.
SocGen analyst Alyson Coates said she had cautiously estimated sales of 150 million pounds for the drug by the year 2000 and peak sales of 350 million pounds a year.
But she said questions remained about whether Lamivudine would be more effective when taken together with other drugs, just as Epivir works better in combination, and on how resistant the virus might be to the drug in some people.
Glaxo Wellcome is one of a number of companies working on products for Hepatitis B.
SmithKline Beecham Plc is developing a version of its herpes treatment Famvir, and Germany's Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Vion Pharmaceuticals Inc and Gilead Sciences Inc of the United States and Britain's Medeva Plc also have products in clinical trials. ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)

JonathanBirt,"Shares in British drugs company Zeneca Group Plc had another busy day on Friday as the bid rumour mill again started churning, overshadowing a key patent victory in the United States.
Zeneca shares climbed 35 pence to 18.55 pounds ($30.06) in late afternoon trading after a U.S. Appeals Court threw out a patent challenge to one of its top-selling drugs, breast cancer treatment Nolvadex.
The ruling, which follows a U.S. district court decision in Zeneca's favour a year ago, means that Canadian generic drug maker Novopharm Ltd will not be able to market a generic version of Nolvadex before Zeneca's patent runs out in 2002.
But analysts said the ruling was widely expected and pointed the finger instead at the Swiss magazine Cash for driving up Zeneca's shares.
Cash said Swiss giant Roche Holdings AG was about to announce an agreed takeover of the British group.
Stephen Putnam, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: ""I think this rise has more to do with rumours about a Roche bid. I can't believe anybody thought there would be a different outcome (to the Novopharm appeal).""
In an unsourced article, Cash said Roche was planing to offer between 21 and 22 pounds per share for Zeneca, which it would then break up, selling off the agricultural chemical and specialty seeds divisions as well as Roche's own fragrances and aromas division.
Both companies, increasingly weary of the mounting bid speculation, again declined to comment. But London analysts laughed the suggestion out of court.
""Frankly, for 21 pounds they'd be lucky to get the agricultural chemicals division. I think the bidding would start at 30 pounds,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. ""Zeneca is not interested and doesn't need to embark on a merger,"" he added.
Zeneca's patent victory against Novopharm has, however, strengthened its main attraction for any possible bidder -- its strong product portfolio.
Nolvadex is the world's top-selling breast cancer treatment, with sales of 2.7 billion pounds since its launch. Last year Zeneca sold 332 million pounds worth of Nolvadex, making it one of its biggest money spinners.
Zeneca began legal action against Novopharm in January 1995 after the Canadian company tried to get U.S. regulatory approval for a generic version of Nolvadex, also known as Tamoxifen Citrate.
Two other patent challenges for Nolvadex in the U.S, against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pharmachemie BV, are outstanding. A third, against Lemmon Co, was dropped after Lemmon withdrew its marketing application.
Kevin Scotcher, analyst at NatWest Markets, said Zeneca's patent position was now much more secure as a result of the Novopharm ruling. ""This case must strengthen their hand significantly in those other cases,"" he said.
Novopharm has been very active in legal challenges recently, last week successfully winning the right to market a generic version of one of the world's biggest-selling drugs, Glaxo Wellcome Plc's Zantac, from July.

JonathanBirt,"British Gas Plc, which is battling to clear away regulatory and contractual headaches before splitting into two companies, unveiled an expected sharp deterioration in half-year profits on Thursday.
The energy giant revealed a first half dip in historic cost net profit to 565 million pounds ($878.7 million) from 635 million a year before. Pretax profit fell to 926 million from 1.003 billion, and the company turned in a net loss of 8.0 million in the second quarter.
Beleaguered shareholders were offered some comfort, however, with the interim payout kept unchanged at 6.40 pence, but the group refused to make any promises until rows with the industry regulator Ofgas over price controls are resolved.
Last winter's bleak weather provided some relief for the embattled company as it prepares to face the final phasing out of its monopoly in 1998.
Prolonged cold weather added 218 million pounds to operating profits, more than offsetting steep declines at its industrial and commerical arm where competition and controversial ""take or pay"" contracts with gas producers continue to bite.
The company is also locked in a battle with Ofgas over a tough review of the prices it can charge customers.
Chairman Richard Giordano said talks on take or pay gas contracts, which oblige British Gas to pay well above market rates for the gas it buys, are now in a ""realistic phase.""
In a telephone interview, Giordano said these were a major factor behind losses at its industrial and commercial division, which widened to 180 million pounds from 50 million in the first half of 1995.
""The solution to the losses is for us to unhook from take of pay,"" Giordano said, although talks with producers were a gradual process.
""We are in intense negotiations now. We have said we will not do this in public and so both sides are keeping quiet,"" Giordano said.
The chairman also held out some hope on negotiations with regulator Ofgas on separate price reviews of its Transco and domestic energy businesses.
Giordano refused to be drawn on the crucial Transco review, but made clear British Gas has not yet slammed the door on an agreement. ""There is nothing to say on this. We are still meeting with Ofgas,"" Giordano said.
Ofgas wants Transco to cut charges to gas suppliers by 20 percent in 1997 and then 6.5 points below inflation for four years. British Gas, which has until October 7 to respond, has warned that even these watered down proposals could have serious consequences for dividends.
Giordano was more upbeat about the domestic review, where Ofgas wants to fix price changes at five points below inflation. He said a resolution should be in place by ""the end of September or the middle of October,"" adding ""my guess is that we are closer to Ofgas and Ofgas is closer to us on that review.""
Giordano said British Gas was preparing to beef up incentives to keep domestic customers loyal when the market opens fully to competition in 1998.
It launched a credit card on Wednesday which will allow users to save on gas bills. Other initiatives planned include offering illness or unemployment insurance to cover bills, and gas safety checks.
Progress towards a demerger into two separate companies, Transco International and British Gas Energy, is still on target for next spring, with a definite plan expected by the end of 1996.

JonathanBirt,"British Gas Plc, which unveiled an expected sharp deterioration in interim profits on Thursday, is in a ""realistic phase of negotiations"" with producers over crippling gas supply contracts, chairman Richard Giordano said.
In a telephone interview with Reuters, Giordano said so-called ""take or pay"" contracts, which oblige it to buy gas at prices well above market rates, were a major factor behind growing losses at its industrial and commercial division.
""The solution to the losses is for us to unhook from take of pay,"" Giordano said.  
British Gas said progress on the contracts, which force it to pay around 20 pence per therm for gas compared to market rates of 10 to 13 pence, ""is a gradual process.""
""We are in intense negotiations now. We have said we will not do this in public and so both sides are keeping quiet,"" Giordano said.
He added that losses at the industrial and commerical arm rose to 180 million stg from around 50 million a year before as greater competition and costs related to the planned demerger kicked in. First-half results would have been worse but for a 200 million pound benefit from severe winter weather, he said.  
But Giordano said there was no sign of commercial and industrial losses accelerating in the second quarter from the first and stood by his forecast for full-year losses of ""close to"" 400 million stg at the division.
He also held out some hope on the other main headcahes for British Gas, talks with regulator Ofgas on separate price reviews of its Transco and domestic energy businesses.
Giordano refused to be drawn on the crucial Transco review but made clear British Gas has not yet slammed the door on an agreement. ""There is nothing to say on this. We are still meeting with Ofgas,"" Giordano said.  
Ofgas wants Transco to cut charges to gas suppliers by 20 percent in 1997 and then 6.5 points below inflation for four years. British Gas, which has until October 7 to respond, has warned this could have serious consequences for dividends.
Giordano said the group will only be able give indications on dividend prospects when there is clarity on Transco.
But he was more upbeat about the domestic review, wehere Ofgas wants to fix price changes to five points below inflation. He said a resolution should be in place by ""the end of September or the middle of October,"" adding ""my guess is that we are closer to Ofgas and Ofgas is closer to us on that review.""  
Giordano told Reuters British Gas is preparing to beef up incentives to keep domestic customers loyal when the market opens fully to competition in 1998. It launched a credit card on Wednesday, which will allow users to save on gas bills.
He said other initiatives planned include offering illness or unemployment insurance to cover bills, and gas safety checks.
Giordano said a pilot scheme in south-west England has seen the company lose only around 15 percent of customers to rivals, and noted that British Gas has ""more freedom"" to act than in the commercial market, where market share has plummeted because ""our tariffs were locked up and our hands were tied.""  
Giordano said British Gas's progress towards a demerger into two separate companies, Transco International and British Gas Energy, ""are going ok. We are still on target for the Spring of next year.""
He said the formation of the two exective boards has removed ""the biggest hurdle.""
""I'd guess that before the end of the year we'll have a definite plan for the media and shareholders,"" he said, adding: ""Looking ahead if these managements do their job both (companies) should have a basis for prosperity.""

JonathanBirt,"The soaring value of British medical devices company Biocompatibles Plc may be rushing ahead of itself, analysts said on Tuesday.
Shares in the company, which is concentrating its skills in biomaterials on applications in contact lenses and heart surgery, have soared by up to 98 percent since the start of 1997 and by 265 percent in the past year, touching an all-time high of 14.35 stg on April 11.
Although the shares have slipped back from this peak, trading at 13.60 pounds midafternoon on Tuesday, they have still outperformed the FT-SE All Share index by 68 percent since the start of the year, according to Reuters 3000 data.
The surge in value has been built on hopes for Biocompatibles' specially-developed lubricious material, which produces very little reaction with human tissues.
The product has so far led to the creation of a new type of soft contact lens, Proclear, which is targeted at people who suffer from dry eyes, and a coating for stents, which are inserted to expand furred-up arteries in the heart. Proclear, which has already been launched in Britain, won approval from U.S. regulators last week.
Some analysts, notably Yamaichi International's Erling Refsum, believe there is a lot more to come in the share price, which Refsum said could hit the 20 stg mark by the end of the year.
Refsum said the company is expected to sign three major licensing deals for its contact lenses, stents and a paint additives operation, all of which will help to drive sentiment. He forecasts pre-tax profits for the previously loss-making group of 17.5 million stg in 1998 after a small profit this year.
Refsum said that despite a number of competitors, Biocompatibles' phosphocoline-based coatings appear to give its stents strong advantages over rivals, particularly in reducing the risk of thrombosis.
Other analysts are more cautious, however. Nick Woolf of Nomura, who believes the shares are ""probably looking quite expensive,"" said ""the real value is in their stents business, and they have got to demonstrate that their product will deliver a demonstrable benefit,"" said Woolf.
Henry Cooke Lumsden analyst Thomas Geimer, who also believes the shares are overvalued at present, said in a recent note that ""competitors are lurking round every corner.""
Although Geimer believes the company will be able to achieve close to 10 million stg of stent sales this year, at 1,500 stg each, he said maintaining prices in a competitive market will be hard.
Nomura's Woolf added ""it is not that we are negative"" on the stock. ""It is moving ahead too quickly.""

JonathanBirt,"Shares in Anglo-Australian drugs and diagnostics group Cortecs International Plc could rise by more than 60 percent if news due shortly on one of its leading drugs is positive, analysts said on Tuesday.
Cortecs president Michael Flynn told Reuters he expected to announce the interim result of a key European Phase III trial on Macritonin, a new drug for treating the bone-wasting illness osteoporosis, at the end of next week or early the week after.
Flynn said that if the results ""are positive, as we expect, they will be used as the pivotal data for the first applications for registration in Europe.""
Cortecs has used its skills in developing oral versions of drugs to create a tablet form of calcitonin, which increases bone retention of calcium and slows the loss of bone mass.
Analysts believe oral calcitonin, to be taken once a day, will have strong advantages over the existing injected form of calcitonin and over a nasal spray version, Miacalcic, marketed by Switzerland's Novartis AG. The market for the existing drugs is around $800 million a year and is expected to grow strongly as population in the developed world ages.
""There is the potential for a lot of very positive news,"" Nomura analsyt Nick Woolf, who has issued a strong buy note on Cortecs, told Reuters.
Woolf said the shares could rise to 420 pence if the trial data was positive. ""The shares could almost double if news is good. It is very important for them.""
Shares in the company were up 19-1/2 pence at 256-1/2 in midday trading, but remain well below their March 21 high of 291 pence and their April 1996 peak of 450 pence.
""The stock has been moving down on no news other than people getting scared by what may come out,"" said Woolf.
But analysts said Cortecs had already established proof of principle for Macritonin, and has a number of international marketing partners lined up.
Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum also sees considerable upside to Cortecs' shares. He values the company's portfolio of drugs, which include oral insulin and chronic bronchitis products and an oral influenza vaccine, at around 1.5 billion stg compared with its current market capitalisation of just over 300 million stg.
Refsum said the calcitonin data, which will indicate the drug's ability to reduce bone destruction, should boost confidence in Cortecs, ""because people are not confident about the company at the moment.""
Refsum is particularly bullish about Macritonin, which he said could be ""a billion dollar product if they have got it right, and I suspect they have.""
Cortecs management believes osteoporosis products could become the largest class of drugs in the world, overtaking anti-ulcer treatments. Around 200 million mainly elderly people currently suffer from the condition in OECD countries, and the numbers at risk in the U.S. alone are expected to double over the next 25 years as the population ages.
Tom Geimer of Henry Cooke Lumsden added to the upbeat predictions on the share price. He said positive trial results on Macritonin would ""fundamentally support values near 300 pence"" but added that ""as the shares have traditionally been a trading stock, we expect them to break 400 pence on positive news.""
But Geimer added a note of caution on Cortecs, which has enjoyed a chequered career as far as investors are concerned, most notably an upset in 1991 involving trials of oral insulin in Korea.
""Cortecs is progressing nicely,"" Geimer said in a written commentary, but he added: ""We advise investors to remember that Cortecs, despite its recent progress in the lab and clinic, still needs to prove itself in the market.""

JoWinterbottom,"British electronics retailer Dixons Group Plc on Wednesday said strong personal computer sales helped profits jump 53 percent and sales rise eight percent in the first half.
But profit taking and concern over the impact of planned tax increases affecting extended warranties took the shine off its shares, which fell 27 pence to close at 511 pence.
""Bearing in mind the sort of out-performance we have seen lately (in the shares), the shares are running into some profit-taking,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
The group said pretax profits in the six months to November 9, 1996, soared to 57.5 million pounds ($97.4 million), at the top end of expectations, from 37.5 million pounds previously, and paid out a dividend of 2.4 pence, up from 2.05 pence.
On the turnover front, Dixons said sales from existing stores were up eight percent in the first half, a figure maintained in the first eight weeks of the second half which covers the key Christmas period.
""Christmas trading was highly satisfactory,"" chairman Sir Stanley Kalms said in a statement.
Managing director John Clare told Reuters that consumer spending was growing but there was no boom, adding that if the economy was managed well, ""we can't see any reason why it should not continue.""
PCs and accessories including software accounted for around 26 percent of the group's total sales in the first half, inching towards 30 percent over the Christmas period, he added.
""I expect personal computer sales to grow...household penetration is still very low in the UK,"" Clare added.
Dixons said its PC World division, which specialises in PC sales in out-of-town superstores, saw total sales rocket 96 percent higher in the first half, or 21 percent stripping out the effect of new selling space.
Dixons opens around ten PC World superstores each year and Clare said that expansion rate was expected to continue.
Gross margins in the early weeks of the second half were ""at similar levels year on year,"" Kalms said in the statement, after increasing ""slightly"" in the first half.
Dixons said that it could not predict the full effect of the government's plans to raise insurance premium tax to 17.5 percent from a previous 2.5 percent on its extended warranty business.
""There is a bit of worry over what the impact might be,"" one share trader said.
Kalms, however, told Reuters Financial Television, ""I don't expect it (the tax change) to be of much consequence to our overall profitability.""
Clare said future margins were also hard to predict, with a ""swings and roundabouts"" pull between lower margins on PC hardware and the benefits of reduced credit promotion competition.
""There are two contrary forces at work...PCs are taking a higher share of the product mix...(but) there are benefits from reduced competitive activity, particularly in credit promotions,"" he said.
Retail outlets of regional electricity companies have been trimmed, for example, as a result of takeovers and consolidation in the sector.
Clare said digital technology was likely to provide another growth market for the company with wide-screen digital television likely to debut in 1998.
""Digital technology is generally coming in in a big way...(but) I don't think it will replace PCs, because PCs will continue to grow,"" he said.
Capital investment during the current financial year is expected to be over 100 million pounds and at similar levels for the year after. ($1=.5904 Pound)

JoWinterbottom,"British electronics retailer Dixons Group Plc showed the benefit of strong personal computer (PC) sales on Wednesday with a 53 percent jump in first half profits and an eight percent increase in sales.
But profit taking and concern over the impact of planned tax increases affecting extended warranties took the shine off its shares, which fell 20 pence to 518 pence by 1130 GMT.

JoWinterbottom,"Dixons Group Plc became the latest British retailer to report a boost in Christmas sales on Wednesday but market watchers said there was no 1980s-style boom as discriminating buyers kept shops competitive.
""There isn't a big consumer boom but there is growth in the consumer economy,"" Dixons managing director John Clare told Reuters as the electronic goods firm reported sales up eight percent in the period over Christmas.
""There is certainly a return to the ""feel good' factor, but it isn't a return to the spend, spend, spend culture of the eighties,"" said Clive Vaughan, retail consultant at research group Verdict.
Analysts pointed out that as Christmas fell on a Wednesday in 1996, many shoppers left purchases to the last minute and retailers were likely to have seen a late flurry of buying.
At the same time, consumers are more discerning than in past years, preferring to pay for quality and investing in durables, which has favoured the higher end of the retail sector.
""Consumers are more discerning, so the high street is still very competitive on price and quality,"" said Hugh Clark of the British Retail Consortium, which represents over 90 percent of retailers and will release its December sales figures next week.
British money supply data released on Monday showed a higher than expected increase in December month-on-month figures, suggesting continuing buoyancy on the high street, analysts said.
Leading British department store Harrods, kicking off its January sale, said on Wednesday sales during the Christmas period were up 10 percent and two percent ahead of budget.
""It was a very strong, very consistent Christmas,"" said Michael Cole, Harrods director of public affairs.
On the Monday before Christmas, Harrods had sales of three million pounds ($5 million), compared with average daily intake of 1.2 to 1.5 million, he said, record Monday takings for the group.
Meanwhile, Merchant Retail Group said on Wednesday its specialist Perfume Shop chain saw same store sales soar 18.6 percent in the Christmas period.
Department store chain John Lewis said last week that sales in the week ending December 28 were up 8.8 percent on a year ago, while jewellers Goldsmiths said sales from existing stores jumped 9.8 percent in the Christmas period.
Aspreys, jewellers to the Royal Family, told a newspaper last week that Christmas sales had been ""substantially better than last year, a double-digit increase.""
Clothing retailer Next Plc is expected to report Christmas sales by mid-January but analysts pointed out that its strong brand image should bolster performance.
""Indications are that the polarisation of stronger versus weaker retailers continues,"" said Roy Maconochie, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. ""The consumer is more discriminating so stronger brands win out,""
Verdict's Vaughan said consumer demographics were also influencing product sales as the youthful buyers of the eighties become the more cautious over-30-year-old consumers of the nineties and have more disposable income. ($1=.5922 Pound)
"
JoWinterbottom,"Troubled British stores group Sears Plc warned on Thursday that annual profits would fall below last year's levels and reported disappointing Christmas trading.
The news hit Sears shares and prompted analysts to say the group should be broken up.
""The corpse has clearly not responded to treatment and now they should do the decent thing, which is to break it up,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Sears said in a statement that full-year pretax profits before exceptional items would be significantly below last year's 100.1 million pounds ($169 million) and added that Christmas same store sales slipped 0.5 percent from a year ago.
Shares, which had already fallen after The Guardian newspaper had said that profits would fall, closed down 4p, or 4.4 percent, at 87-1/2p after a low of 83.
Analysts said annual profit forecasts could now be trimmed back to around 80-90 million pounds from previous levels of around 110-120 million pounds.
But Sears's flagship London department store Selfridges performed well, with sales in the second half to January 6 up 8.6 percent, comparable with other retailers who have reported trading over the key Christmas period so far.
Clothing sales were also up, by eight percent in the period, with womenswear, which includes high street chains Wallis, Warehouse and Miss Selfridge, boosting sales by 14.3 percent.
But childrenswear saw turnover down four percent and footwear, Sears's persistent problem area, fell 2.8 percent at the start of the second half.
Sales at Sears's home shopping business Freemans slid 6.5 percent early in the second half and it said it expected to make an announcement soon on talks about selling the business to the privately-owned mail order-to-pools group Littlewoods.
Analysts have suggested that Freemans could be worth around 350 million pounds in such a deal, with some looking for a price of as much as 500 million.
""It is now all about the break-up value,"" said the analyst.
The company tried to ditch part of its British Shoe business last year but this was scuppered when the stores had to be taken back from retailer Facia after Facia's collapse in June 1996.
Analysts said Selfridges could be worth over 500 million pounds while a conservative valuation of one times turnover for the clothing business would mean a price of 600 million pounds.
""That means that the British Shoe business is seen by the market as a liability to the tune of around 200-300 million pounds,"" the analyst said.
He put a valuation of around 101-102 pence per share on Selfridges, the clothing business and the revenue from any sale of Freemans, around 19 percent above current share levels.
""I would hope they are going to do something radical, getting rid of British Shoe, even for a nominal sum, would free the company of that liability,"" the analyst said.
A flotation or sale of Selfridges is also seen as an option, or potentially a bid for the company although analysts said there were few likely buyers.
The company's poor performance could increase pressure for chief executive Liam Strong to quit, analysts said, after some five years at the helm trying to mend the group's fortunes.
Strong faced calls for his resignation in June from shareholders angry at the lack of progress in turning the sprawling retail business around. ($1=.5922 Pound)
"
JoWinterbottom,"British supermarket retailer J. Sainsbury Plc tried to steal a march on its competitors on Friday by launching insurance products through its Homebase do-it-yourself subsidiary.
The deal, which sees Sainsbury teaming up with brokers Willis Corroon, will offer home and contents insurance, garden insurance and personal accident insurance with details to be released to the public in early February.
Sainsbury became the first supermarket to announce plans to break into banking in October when it teamed up with Bank of Scotland to set up Sainsbury's Bank, which awaits a licence from UK authorities.
The insurance service will be offered to all Homebase customers which are thought to total around 12 million, with initial marketing aimed at the unit's two million loyalty card holders.
The service will be provided by a panel made up of Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, Guardian Royal Exchange, Norwich Union, Eagle Star and Lloyds of London.
""We believe that the Homebase brand values can make a real difference in the home insurance market,"" Mike Samuel, Homebase head of marketing, said in a statement.
Sainsbury said the major features of the products would be 250 pounds ($420.2) emergency cover, cover for home removal, Christmas, birthdays and accidental damage to televisions and satellites.
In addition, discounts of over 50 pounds would be offered on Homebase security products when a policy is taken out.
""The product chosen by Sainsbury's Homebase encompasses all the expected features of home insurance but with a safety net of cover not usually available with standard market products,"" said Richard Fry, head of business development at Willis Corroon.
Sainsbury shares had closed down five pence at 387.5 pence before the announcement was made.
Analysts said they were encouraged when Sainsbury moved into banking as there had been concerns that it was losing more and more ground to arch-rival Tesco.
Tesco was the first of the big four supermarket groups to launch a loyalty card and its success forced Sainsbury to bring out its own version around a year later in June 1996.
Safeway also has a loyalty card while ASDA is now testing its own version in selected stores.
Meanwhile Tesco has added a ClubCard Plus credit account for customers while Safeway teamed up with high-street bank Abbey National in November to offer banking services through its ABC loyalty card. ($1=.5950 Pound)
"
JoWinterbottom,"British regional power company Yorkshire Electricity is still a hot favourite for a bid after a rash of takeovers at the end of 1996 left just two independent firms in the sector.
But every day that passes without an offer emerging dampens expectations of a possible takeover, analysts said on Friday.
""Over the next three to four weeks is really a final window before a general election,"" said Nigel Hawkins, analyst with Yamaichi.
The Conservative government, which must call an election by May, has nodded through bids for 10 regional electricity companies (Recs) so far of the original 12 set up at privatisation in 1990.
But there are concerns that the centre-left Labour party, ahead in current opinion polls, might be less amenable to takeovers in a sector which has been fiercely criticised for fat executive pay packets and hefty shareholder payouts.
""Labour would not necessarily wave any bids through in the way the current government has,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named. Yorkshire, which could carry a price of around 1.4 billion pounds ($2.35 billion), is seen as a more likely target for any bid than its colleague Southern.
Southern is the only other independent Rec left after a flurry of bids late last year mopped up three more Recs.
Southern, which could cost up to 2.4 billion pounds or around 9.50 pounds per share, the analyst said, could prove too expensive for a predator on its own.
""It is less digestible (than Yorkshire) but not impossible,"" he said. As a result, a takeover of Southern might involve more than one company working in collaboration.
Yorkshire was trading at 795 pence, up 6.5 pence, in a lower overall market on Friday, compared with expectations of a takeover price around nine pounds. Southern gained five to 779.
Potential buyers are seen as U.S. firms, with six of the original 12 firms now in American hands. The three Recs which succumbed late last year all fell to American buyers.
London and East Midlands agreed to takeovers from Entergy and Dominion Resources respectively, while Northern lost by a whisker its hotly contested battle against CalEnergy.
London's takeover still awaits approval from the British government but analysts expect a go-ahead now that Dominion and CE Electric, CalEnergy's bid vehicle, have had a green light.
American companies are seen as eager to gain the expertise of working in a competitive market with a relatively friendly regulatory environment and see Britain as a useful springboard for expansion into continental Europe, analysts said.
Among rumoured potential predators are Houston Industries, which failed to secure control of Rec Norweb with Central &amp; South West Corp in October 1995.
Central &amp; South West eventually bought Rec Seeboard but speculation continues that Houston might still be interested in the sector.
Florida Power &amp; Light and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric also appear in speculation on potential buyers.
But the failure of any bids to emerge is gradually sapping confidence that the sector will see any more takeover activity among some analysts.
""I would now be surprised if there is a bid. Many predators have now been satisfied and the longer we wait the less likely a bid seems,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named. ($1=.5950 pound)
"
JoWinterbottom,"Britain's Chemical Industries Association (CIA) added its voice on Monday to growing criticism of the electricity wholesale market or ""pool,"" calling for urgent reforms.
""Electricity prices for industrial consumers should have fallen much further...The answer is reform of the pool and urgently,"" the CIA told Reuters.
The association's members account for around 20 percent of Britain's industrial electricity use.
Industry observers said pressure could be mounting for an investigation of the way the pool operates by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
""Our view is that the pool is not structured to deliver competitive pricing,"" a CIA spokesman said.
The pool is a complex system used to set electricity wholesale prices which many users say gives unfair market control to big generators such as National Power and PowerGen.
Many large industrial users buy electricity directly from the pool rather than through regional electricity companies (Recs).
Criticisms of the system have come from a variety of sources over the past year including the British Retail Consortium (BRC), consumer watchdog the Electricity Consumers Committee and one of Britain's largest electricity users, RJB Mining Plc.
A year ago, the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG), which includes members of the CIA, called for an MMC inquiry into the pool during a review which eventually decided to ban planned takeovers of Recs by National Power and PowerGen.
The CIA claimed that prices paid for energy through the pool were 10 percent higher in the first half of the current financial year over the same period a year ago while delivered electricity prices were trending down.
The group said cost savings made by generators should be passed on to downstream customers.
""Despite falling raw material costs, and improvements in efficiency, generators have been able to manipulate the price of electricity and avoid passing a fair share of these gains on to customers,"" the CIA said.

JoWinterbottom,"British retail chain Kingfisher Plc said on Friday it would axe 1,200 jobs from the Norweb retail chain it bought in November 1996 and shut stores to integrate the purchase with its Comet electrical chain.
In a statement, Kingfisher said it would close 28 Norweb retail stores, which also sell electrical goods, along with 26 Comet stores and upgrade Comet out-of-town stores to raise the total number nationwide to 250 from a current 225 sites.
A further 26 Norweb retail stores in locations new to Comet would become Comet stores, Kingfisher said in a statement.
It added that Comet would go ahead with plans announced by Norweb retail last year before it was taken over to close all the chain's 57 high street sites at the beginning of March.
A further 26 Norweb retail stores in locations new to Comet will become Comet stores, Kingfisher said in a statement.
Norweb's total workforce before the job cuts numbers about 2,800.
""This acquisition is a good strategic move and will provide Comet with a significant number of first class retail locations and experienced people,"" said Kingfisher chief executive Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy.
Kingfisher bought Norweb retail for 51 million pounds ($85.30 million) from United Utilities, which had taken over regional electricity company Norweb around a year ago.
Kingfisher also announced on Friday that it had issued a 200 million pound bond, which analysts said was likely to be used for restructuring debt.
But some said the issue could focus attention again on reports earlier this week Kingfisher might increase its stake in French electrical retailer BUT, although BUT described an article in Thursday's Financial Times as ""unfounded.""
""The bond issue doesn't surprise me as it will help to restructure debt. But it will certainly focus attention on the BUT stake again,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
Kingfisher declined to comment on the report on Thursday and there was no-one available to comment on Friday.
Kingfisher already holds a 26 percent stake in BUT and the Financial Times said on Thursday it was planning to mount a takeover offer, which the newspaper estimated could cost up to 300 million pounds.
Kingfisher bought the stake in BUT, which is France's second biggest furniture chain and fourth largest electricals group last year for 59 million pounds.
Under the deal, it should have to wait until 1998 before making any offer but analysts suggested this might be adjusted if Kingfisher were interested in raising its stake.
Analysts said such a move would be beneficial to Kingfisher.
""It would certainly be earnings enhancing in the first year,"" the analyst said.
He said Kingfisher would reap benefits from integrating BUT stores with its French electrical retailer Darty, which is the market leader. ""Darty is star quality on electricals with higher returns on sales than Dixons,"" the British electrical retail chain, said the analyst.
""Combining the two could boost returns on BUT's electricals, which has turnover of around 500 million pounds but makes little profit,"" he added.
But analysts remained cautious that such a deal might be in the offing. ""I don't think it will happen this year, I think they might have to wait until 1998,"" said one sector analyst.

JoWinterbottom,"British supermarkets will be looking for ways to improve profitability in 1997.
Price will remain an important factor, analysts say, but the year will be dominated by a hunt for higher margins.
""We are keen to see whether supermarkets are planning to drive sales further or improve margins,"" said Dave Stoddart, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
""Any fool can get sales growth, getting profitable sales growth is the trick,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Analysts said ASDA, which prides itself on being the cheapest against major chains Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Safeway, could set a trend if it moves to underpin sales growth outperformance by raising margins.
An ASDA spokesman told Reuters that ""margins are obviously important but there's no way our focus will move away from price.""
In 1996, supermarkets entered a fierce petrol price war with oil majors which saw margins squeezed and some chains selling at a loss, but there are indications that this might have abated and margins might recover, analysts said.
ASDA's 10.2 percent sales growth from existing stores in the first half is the strongest of the big four and latest figures from research group Taylor Nelson/AGB suggest its market share was 14.8 percent at the end of 1996, putting it in third place.
""ASDA needs to start consolidating on good profits and that could make it less inclined to slash profits,"" the analyst said.
LOOKING AT DIVERSIFICATION
That could ease competitive pressures for the other three majors, analysts said, allowing them to look increasingly at diversification, such as financial services and loyalty cards.
Sainsbury chairman David Sainsbury said in October 1996 that he thought the current year was about getting the basics right while next year would be about improving profits.
Tesco's ClubCard loyalty scheme rocketed the group into the lead on market share a year ago and prompted arch-rival Sainsbury to change its mind and launch its own card in 1996.
In October 1996, Sainsbury went a step further to team up with Bank of Scotland to set up a bank and has also launched insurance services through its Homebase do-it-yourself subsidiary in partnership with brokers Willis Corroon.
FINANCIAL SERVICES ADD VALUE
""Financial services is an example of an area where supermarkets can add value for existing customers,"" said Clive Vaughan of Verdict Research.
ASDA is the only one of the big four which does not have a nationwide loyalty card, seeing little need for one while sales remain strong, but it is testing a scheme in selected stores.
Analysts say there could be a marked increase in the sophisticated use of the database provided by loyalty cards this year, allowing better targeting of product offers at specific customer groups.
Supermarkets are also expected to explore the possibilities of home shopping, including via the Internet, although a spokeswoman for Sainsbury said the group was concerned about the network's slow speed.
Sainsbury is also looking at other home shopping ideas such as ""Order and Collect,"" where shoppers telephone or fax an order to the store and collect the whole package at an appointed time.
This is currently being being tested at its Watford branch, just north of London, and is likely to be rolled out to more stores in March, the spokeswoman said.
EXPANDING INTO NON-FOOD RANGES
Supermarkets are also expected to diversify their product range, both in food where the search will be on for added value products which bring higher margins, and non-food products such as clothing and home entertainment, analysts said.
""The larger supermarkets will have the advantages here,"" Vaughan said, such as ASDA which mostly has out-of-town hypermarkets where it offers its ""George"" own-brand clothing range alongside produce, videos, televisions and a wide range of non-food items.
ASDA's chief executive Allan Leighton has said he would like to boost clothing sales to around 10 percent of total or some 600 million pounds ($1 billion) of sales per year.
OPPORTUNITIES ABROAD
Diversification could also mean eyeing opportunities overseas, where both Sainsbury and Tesco already have interests.
Sainsbury could look to expand in the U.S., analysts said, where it already holds a 20 percent stake in Giant, while its U.S. unit Shaw's bought 12 stores and two sites from Royal Ahold for 52 million pounds in September, 1996.
Tesco has said it is interested in expanding in France after its 1993 purchase of the Catteau chain but ruled itself out of the bidding last year for Docks de France, which was taken over by the private retailer Auchan.
Tesco increased its stake in the Hungarian retail chain Global TH Rt to 95 percent last week.
Analysts said supermarkets could be looking at takeovers and store purchases domestically as well, as the sector looks ripe for some consolidation.
William Morrison, the regional chain based in northern England, was cited as a potential bid target but analysts said there could be competition problems in such an acquisition for any of the big four store groups. ($1=.5979 Pound)

JoWinterbottom,"Britain's United Utilities may wait two to three years before it earns profits from a contract it won as part of a consortium for water and sewerage services in Manila on Thursday, analysts said.
They said it was difficult to assess likely profits until further details of the deal were released, although one who asked not to be named said they could be around five million pounds ($8.17 million) a year.
The Manila Water Company (MWC), which comprises United Utilities, Bechtel Corp of the U.S. and local conglomerate Ayala Corp won a contract on Thursday for water supply and sewerage in Manila's east zone. The Philippines government awarded the deal after MWC submitted the lowest water tariff of 2.32 pesos per litre, or 26.3886 percent of the existing fee of 8.78 pesos.
Analysts said other groups had bid upwards of 60 percent of the existing tariff in the contract.
MWC also posted the lowest bid in the west zone, but that contract was awarded to France's Lyonnaise des Eaux SA and Benpres Holdings Corp, another leading Philippines business group, as the contracts must go to different bidders.
United Utilities said in a statement that capital expenditure on the project was expected to be $1.7 billion, while Manila officials are expecting both groups to invest a total of around $7 billion.
The concession runs for 25 years and calls on MWC to serve 4.6 million of Manila's population of some 12 million through operating, upgrading and extending the city's water and wastewater systems, United Utilities said.
The current clean water system suffers nearly 50 percent losses, United Utilities said.
Analysts said the MWC group might be aiming to make cost reductions through staff cuts in order to make the concession profitable, as well as squeezing the amount of water lost.
Antonino Aquino, a senior official at Ayala, said the key to making the project economically viable would be to reduce the portion of non-revenue water, caused by leaks or pilfering, which is currently estimated at 58 percent.
But analysts said that as United Utilities would focus on running the system once it was upgraded and extended, any benefits would have to wait for a few years.
""United will probably see the benefits after the investment has been made...it could be three to four years before there is any significant contribution,"" said one sector analyst.
Shares were down 6-1/2 pence at 671.25 pence by 1441 GMT, while shares in Anglian, which was in a consortium that failed to win either contract were up 7.5 pence at 622 pence.
Analysts said that cost cutting and reducing leakage and stolen water could help MWC to wring increasing profits from the deal, even though price tariffs are reportedly fixed for 10 years.
""There are huge savings to be made...the numbers don't look that attractive but the cost savings could help the revenue stream,"" the sector analyst said.
The move also fits with UU's aim of developing its non-core businesses, analysts said, where the company hopes international projects could boost profits by 40 million pounds in 2000.
But UBS analyst Lakis Athanasiou said on Wednesday that the company could struggle to find extra profits needed to fulfill its promise of 11 percent real dividend growth per year to 2000.
""We think the targets are ambitious,"" he said, adding that UBS expects dividend growth of around six percent per year.

JoWinterbottom,"British supermarket group J. Sainsbury Plc dropped a profits warning bombshell into the market on Friday, sending its own shares plummeting by 13 percent and bringing other stocks under pressure.
Sainsbury said pretax profits for the current year before a provision of 50 million pounds ($81.7 million) would be 640-650 million pounds, well below consensus forecasts of over 700 million, as it admitted the cost of improving sales would hurt.
It said sales from existing supermarket stores rose 4.4 percent in the eight weeks to January 11, an improvement on the three percent gain seen in October but still behind market leader Tesco's 7.5 percent jump, reported on Monday.
Sainsbury shares slumped 53 pence to 339 pence by 1600 GMT, falling below arch-rival Tesco's share price for the first time. Tesco shares shed eight to 360 pence.
""Sainsbury's fall has destabilised the whole sector and there are worries margins will be under pressure if competition hots up,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
ASDA, which prides itself on being the cheapest of the big four supermarkets, eased 2.75 pence to 121-1/2 pence while Safeway dropped 13 to 389-1/2.
""I'm amazed that (Sainsbury's) price hasn't fallen further,"" said Nick Bubb, analyst at Mees Pierson, adding that Sainsbury still looked overpriced compared with the rest of the sector.
Before profit downgrades, Sainsbury was on a forecast price to earnings ratio of 14, according to Reuters 3000 data from Edinburgh Financial, towards the top end of the food retailing sector, ahead of Safeway and ASDA.
""The shares have quite rightly been marked down to a market rating but a discount rating would be more appropriate,"" said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified.
Some observers suggested Sainsbury might be prompted to cut prices in an effort to move sales ahead, but analysts said it was more likely to look at boosting offers and advertising.
""Price is not in vogue at the moment,"" added one analyst who asked not to be named.
But Dave Stoddart at Henderson Crosthwaite pointed out that ""any cost-additive or gross margin-reducing activity will worry the market and pressure other shares.""
Analysts downgraded Sainsbury profit forecasts for 1997/98 as well, with Bubb looking for pretax profits of 673 million pounds from a previous forecast of 780 million pounds.
""I had no idea (sales growth) would have cost them so much...the cost benefit of the sales improvement is way out of line,"" Bubb said.
Sainsbury chairman David Sainsbury said in a statement that he was ""disappointed that the costs of building sales across the businesses have impacted group profit.""
Sainsbury's chief executive of Homebase do-it-yourself and U.S. businesses David Bremner said the company's Reward loyalty card accounted for ""probably the majority of the impact"" on sales growth but admitted there was a short-term cost.
He told Reuters the task facing management next year was ""to improve profits,"" adding that ""obviously, we would always like to improve sales."" Sainsbury was forced to launch Reward after the success of ClubCard helped Tesco to boost sales and leap ahead of Sainsbury as market leader.

"
JoWinterbottom,"British supermarket group J. Sainsbury stunned markets on Friday and sent its shares reeling as it admitted the cost of improving sales will hit profits, wiping some 60 million pounds ($98 million) off forecasts.
Sainsbury said in a statement that pretax profits for the year were expected to be 640-650 million pounds excluding a 50 million pound provision on its Texas do-it-yourself business, compared with analysts' forecasts of over 700 million.
Shares tumbled as analysts raced to downgrade forecasts, losing 43 pence, or almost 11 percent, to 349 pence.
""I had no idea (sales growth) would have cost them so much...the cost benefit of the sales improvement is way out of line,"" said Nick Bubb, analyst at Mees Pierson.
Sainsbury said sales from existing supermarkets rose 4.4 percent in the eight weeks ending January 11 and that trend has continued, compared with a three percent rise in October 1996.
Arch-rival Tesco, which pushed Sainsbury off the market leader slot over a year ago, earlier this week reported sales growth of 7.5 percent over the key Christmas period.
""We are disappointed that the costs of building sales across the businesses have impacted group profit,"" chairman David Sainsbury said in a statement.
Bubb said he was ""amazed that the share price has not fallen further,"" adding that Sainsbury still looked overpriced compared to the rest of the supermarket sector.
Before profit downgrades, Sainsbury was on a forecast price to earnings ratio of 14, according to Reuters 3000 data from Edinburgh Financial, towards the top end of the food retailing sector, ahead of Safeway and ASDA.
""The shares have quite rightly been marked down to a market rating but a discount rating would be more appropriate,"" said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified.
Sainsbury's chief executive of Homebase do-it-yourself and U.S. businesses David Bremner said the company's Reward loyalty card accounted for ""probably the majority of the impact"" on sales growth but admitted there was a short-term cost.
He told Reuters the task facing management next year was ""to improve profits,"" adding that ""obviously, we would always like to improve sales.""
Sainsbury was forced to launch Reward after the success of ClubCard helped Tesco to boost sales and leap ahead of Sainsbury as market leader at the end of 1995.
Reward's costs have edged up to around 0.75 percent of sales compared with 0.4 percent in the first half, the analyst said, which could imply a need for sales growth nearer five percent.
""The costs of loyalty are clearly greater than they thought,"" he said.
Analysts were concerned that Sainsbury might have to sink more investment to improve sales and profits and forecasts for 1997/98 were also cut, with Bubb slashing estimates to 673 million pounds from 780 million previously.
Sainsbury said that management was now focused ""on turning increased sales into profit growth,"" but analysts questioned how this could be achieved.
""What do they have to do next, what more costs need to go in?"" asked one sector analyst.
Bubb added that despite Homebase's strong sales, which bounced 7.8 percent from existing stores in the 16 weeks to January 11, the 50 million pound provision was a concern.
Sainsbury said it aimed to convert an extra 25 Texas stores, which it bought from Ladbroke in 1995, to its Homebase format, which has given an uplift of 40 percent in sales at stores already given the new format.
""The full store conversion process remains the key to unlocking the potential of the Texas acquisition,"" Sainsbury said. ($1=.6119 Pound)
"
JoWinterbottom,"Shares in British supermarkets fell on Monday after a study said they were closer to a price war than they have been for 15 years.
But analysts remain sceptical that stores will risk such a move, and supermarkets themselves appeared reluctant to sacrifice their profit margins.
The study by research group Verdict adding to market worries after J. Sainsbury Plc, now replaced as Britain's favourite supermarket chain by Tesco Plc, warned last Friday that its profits would be hit by efforts to boost sales.
Verdict said in a report prepared before Sainsbury's warning that profits would be 50 million pounds ($81.2 million) below expectations that risks of a price war were greater than at any time since 1982.
Verdict analyst Clive Vaughan said Sainsbury's comments increased the probability to ""closer to 50 percent.""
But Sainsbury ""is not planning to start a price war,"" a spokeswoman for the company said, adding that ""we are already very competitive.""
Market leader Tesco ""continues to offer unbeatable value,"" the campaign which it launched in September 1996, a Tesco spokesman said.
Analysts said the big four supermarkets, which also include Safeway and ASDA, were unlikely to want to risk the damage to margins which cutting prices would entail.
""A price war remains on the horizon rather than imminent,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Sainsbury is struggling to gain the initiative snatched by arch-rival Tesco which leapt into the market lead just over a year ago and is seeing sales growth of 7.5 percent.
Sainsbury's sales were up 4.4 percent over the key Christmas trading period, an improvement over three percent gains seen in October 1996 but still not enough to threaten Tesco.
Shares in the company, which is 40 percent owned by the Sainsbury family, fell 10 pence on Monday to trade at 331 pence after plunging more than 10 percent on Friday.
Tesco saw its shares slip 5-1/2 to 354-1/2 pence while Safeway, the fourth largest store group, was down 12 pence at 377 pence and ASDA, which prides itself on being the cheapest of the big four, eased 1-1/2 to 120 pence.
""The market is right to mark shares down as a precaution...(but) no-one would ever dream"" of launching a full-scale price war, said Nick Bubb of Mees Pierson.
British supermarkets generally obtain gross margins of 20-26 percent, analysts said, giving them flexibility to battle on price but with the leading four holding a majority of the market, there is little inclination to give up healthy profits.
""The supermarkets are in a state of relative equilibrium and Sainsbury is the last one to offer more margin at this stage,"" said the analyst.
Tesco is in a stronger position ""and could be tempted to enforce that,"" he added, but suggested any move would fall short of a full price war where retailers might make hefty cuts on several thousand items, costing a couple of points on margins.
""Tesco might be tempted to stick the boot in, but...the more (it) forces Sainsbury into further problems, the more it would have to face retaliation,"" Bubb said.
Analysts said supermarkets were more likely to push ahead with initiatives such as loyalty cards, improved customer services and marketing in order to increase sales and profits.
""I think at this stage a price war is unlikely, but if sales fall substantially for any of the big four, that situation could change,"" the analyst said. ($1=.6161 Pound)
"
JoWinterbottom,"British supermarket group Tesco Plc has put price back on top of the agenda with a new campaign and, although analysts played down fears of a price war on Thursday, loyalty cards could take a back seat to value for money.
""Loyalty is a factor but price is the most important factor,"" said analyst Richard Perks of Verdict Research.
After markets had closed on Wednesday, Tesco said it would invest 30 million pounds ($47 million) in its ""Unbeatable Value"" campaign, promising to offer the lowest prices on 600 items in addition to regular monthly offers on 2,000 lines.
It said customers who found the items cheaper at other stores would be refunded twice the difference and Tesco would lower its own prices immediately.
Its shares, which had fallen earlier this week on worries of an aggressive campaign, rebounded on Thursday to be up seven pence to 298 by 1445 GMT. Arch-rival J. Sainsbury was down 3-1/2 at 373.
""These are budgeted cuts, not panic price-cutting, there's no reason to reduce forecasts,"" said one sector analyst who declined to be named.
Sainsbury launched its own autumn campaign, targeting 700 items in a continuation of regular monthly moves, on September 1. A spokeswoman declined to comment on Tesco's move.
""A war has to have two sides. We are not fighting anyone. We are here for our customers,"" a Tesco spokesman said.
Analysts questioned why the market leader would want to prompt a price war, particularly as there are glimmering signs that the economy might be improving.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on Thursday said retail sales volume was up again in August and the balance of firms reporting an increase in business was the largest since November 1988.
In addition, latest market share figures for supermarkets from AGB research suggest Tesco turned in a creditable performance in August after seeing its slice of the cake dip marginally in July.
""I am not particularly concerned...you always get autumn promotional campaigns of some sort and (Tesco's) may be just a bit more aggressive than we have seen in the past,"" said Dave Stoddart, sector analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
But BZW was reported to be concerned that Tesco's move could precipitate cuts elsewhere.
Supermarkets are largely keen to avoid a full-blown price war which would shrink margins and eat into profits. The focus recently has been on loyalty cards to boost sales.
The latest launch was the Reward card from Sainsbury, which capitulated in June after the success of Tesco's ClubCard had helped to tip it off the market leader slot last year.
It now has six million subscribers and has generated a boost of around two to three percent in sales, deputy chief executive Dino Adriano said last week.
""Clearly we needed to launch a Reward card. It's become a way of doing business within this marketplace,"" Adriano said.
Among the big four British supermarket groups, only ASDA has so far held back from launching a loyalty card. It is running trials in 18 stores and has not ruled it out.
But the indications are that loyalty cards are largely just breaking even for supermarkets and providing a means of retaining customers rather than adding extra shoppers, analysts said.
If Tesco, which leads the market and has 8.5 million subscribers to its ClubCard, feels the need to focus on price, other supermarkets may find it hard not to follow. ($1=.6373 Pound)

JoWinterbottom,"British utility stocks rose on Friday on hopes for shareholder benefits after Southern Electric said it would make a complicated share buy back worth up to 156 million pounds ($252.8 million).
Analysts said Southern's move, which followed a similar Yorkshire Water plan announced on Thursday, could provide tax benefits and might bolster arguments against the opposition Labour Party's plans for a one-off levy on utilities.
Southern followed a trail blazed on Thursday by Yorkshire Water by offering a share consolidation which will give all holders free B shares.
It will then offer to buy back these shares at a fixed price, in Southern's case 60 pence per existing ordinary share.
Southern's shares were up 13 pence to 800-1/2 pence by early afternoon and other shares in the water and electricity sectors followed their lead, with South West gaining 10 pence to 672-1/2 pence and Anglian up 11-1/2 pence to 637 pence.
""All the utilities are up on the back of this, everyone is talking about buy-backs,"" said one trader.
Analysts said the moves by Southern and Yorkshire Water would decrease reserve capital and help the companies to avoid paying excess interest on Advanced Corporation Tax (ACT), which they can claim back from the government in two years' time.
The proposals are open to all shareholders and were seen by analysts as a tax-efficient way of returning value. At the same time, the measures will increase the level of debt for companies, which could provide a bolster to arguments against a one-off ""windfall"" tax proposed by Labour, analysts said.
Labour, which is ahead of the ruling Conservatives in polls before a general election due by May, has said it will impose a windfall levy on excess profits of utilities but has given no details of the tax's size or scope.
""Southern is gearing up ahead of an election, which might reduce its exposure to a windfall tax,"" the analyst said.
""A Labour government would find it hard to press them if they claimed there was no spare cash to pay the tax. I'm just surprised Southern has got rid of so little cash,"" the analyst added.
Other companies seen likely to pursue similar moves include Severn Trent, which is waiting to complete a 10 percent share repurchase after picking up 4.9 percent on the market and a small stake from the government in December last year.
South West has a mandate to buy back up to 10 percent of shares and finance director Ken Hill said when half year results were announced in November that the balance sheet was strong enough to handle such a move if appropriate.
Wessex Water announced a 10 percent buyback in December which attracted responses for around 3.2 percent and has also said it will buy around 87 percent of a 19.5 percent stake held by Waste Management International.
Analysts have also suggested Yorkshire Electricity, one of two independent regional electricity companies (Recs) along with Southern left after a spate of takeovers, might have funds for a buyback. ($1=.6172 Pound)
"
JoWinterbottom,"British paper and packaging group Arjo Wiggins Appleton Plc saw half-year profits crumple on Thursday and said although there was some pick-up in demand and margins, prospects for the second half remained fragile.
Arjo's first half pre-tax profits slid to 32.3 million pounds ($50.6 million) from 135.3 million pounds a year ago but maintained its interim dividend at 2.9 pence per share.
The company said in a statement the first half of 1996 and the second half of 1995 was ""the worst period the group has experienced since its flotation"", because of adverse market conditions. Arjo was demerged from B.A.T Industries in 1990.
Speaking of prospects for the second half, finance director Andrew Shaw told Reuters in an interview: ""It is fragile, but there should be better volumes and a bit more stability in margins.""
Arjo's shares were down 4-1/2 pence by 1000 GMT to 181-1/2 pence having touched a low of 180 pence earlier in the day.
""There were weak volumes and pressure on margins"" in the first half, Shaw said.
Pulp prices, the raw material for paper, collapsed from the end of 1995, after nearly two years of steady rises, dragging paper levels down with them, he said.
In Europe particularly, for carbonless and coated paper, margins were squeezed, he said, ""but it looks as if that is over and that could make a big difference,"" he added.
In the U.S., the group's business ""should see quite a pick-up,"" Shaw said.
But he warned that any improvement ""will be driven by economic growth and the prospects in Europe are not very exciting.""
Shaw said it was too early to say if the second half would really see an upturn, but added that the company would like to see ""a nice gentle rise in prices and some steady volumes.""
He said the group should also start to get some benefit from its restructuring in the second half and that savings were likely to be ""more than expected rather than less.""
The group embarked on its restructuring last year, taking an exceptional charge of 120.6 million pounds, and Shaw said the timeframe was 18 months to two years for results to show.
The company expects costs of carbonless paper production to fall by around 100 pounds a tonne as a result of restructuring, Shaw said, while coated paper productivity should gain 25 percent.
Though the outlook for the second half remained fragile, the company was more upbeat about longer term prospects. ""Longer term, however, we are confident in the consolidation of our strong position in European merchanting, the development of our North American businesses and the benefits of the restructuring programme in European manufacturing,"" the company said in a statement.

JoWinterbottom,"British supermarket group Safeway said on Friday that sales growth had slowed since early January and inflation was around zero, prompting fears that consumer belt-tightening could hit the sector, analysts said.
""What has spooked the sector is the comment that things have slowed since the start of the new year,"" said one trader as supermarket shares dived after the Safeway comments.
Safeway said in a statement that same store sales were up 5.2 percent in the five weeks to January 4 but over the first 16 weeks of the second half of the financial year, growth slowed to a 4.5 percent rise.
Deputy chairman David Webster told Reuters that inflation, excluding petrol, was currently running around zero after a modest 0.3 percent rise over the key Christmas period, and the company said lower inflation and slower sales could hit profits.
Safeway, seen as the most technologically innovative of the supermarkets with electronic scanners and automated checkouts, said its experience was ""in common with the sector"".
The company, which has some 7.8 percent of Britain's grocery market, saw its shares slump 25-1/2 pence by 1052 GMT to 363-1/2 pence, making it the third largest loser on the London exchange.
Market leader Tesco, which last month said Christmas sales rose 7.5 percent, fell 16-1/2 pence to 347-1/2.
""What Safeway is saying is that there is a lack of food price inflation and it does not look as if any is on the way,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
""In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance,"" Webster said. It was hard to judge whether the slowdown in sales would continue but he added that the company was still seeing ""significant deflation in produce, which is 10 percent of sales"".
Profit forecasts for Safeway had been shaved by 10 million pounds ($16.40 million) to 430 million pounds, the trader said, compared with pretax profits of 401 million pounds (corrects from 429.4 million pounds) a year ago.
The analyst suggested year profit forecasts for Safeway, Tesco and the two other majors J. Sainsbury and ASDA could be marked down 2-5 percent.
Shares in Sainsbury, which has its own problems -- last week it admitted its profits would be hit by investment in boosting sales as it promotes its loyalty card, dropped seven pence to 321-1/2 pence while ASDA, keeping silent on trading, fell 5-1/2 pence to 115-1/2 pence.
But analysts ruled out a price war among the big four despite the squeeze on profits, as companies are expected to focus on improving margins. ""The last thing you want to do if sales are slowing and inflation is flat is to give away margins,"" the analyst said.
Webster said a price war was very unlikely, adding that if any of the majors launched such an initiative, there would be swift reactions from competitors.
""This is not about price, it is about brand quality,"" the analyst said, adding that Safeway's statement was particularly disappointing after its efforts to restructure and refresh its image over the last two or three years.
Safeway's warning on sales and prices comes hot on the heels of an upbeat report on retailers from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which said high street sales picked up in January and exceeded expectations.
But the CBI added that retailers in its survey expected sales to moderate in February.
Britain's overall inflation rate has slowed to a 2.5 percent rise year-on-year in December, according to latest official figures, while food prices were up a restrained 0.8 percent. ($1=.6097 Pound)
"
JoWinterbottom,"British supermarket group Safeway Plc is currently seeing a zero inflation rate excluding petrol, deputy chairman David Webster told Reuters in an interview.
""Inflation excluding petrol is now probably zero,"" he said.
But Webster said the fall in prices was ""nothing to do with a price war.""  
Webster said he felt shoppers ""are pulling in their belts a little more than usual,"" and added he felt it was ""a sector issue.""
But he said he thought a price war remained ""very unlikely.""
Safeway said in a statement that price inflation had fallen in the early weeks of the new year from a modest 1.1 percent gain seen in the five weeks to January 4.
It said sales growth over the key Christmas trading period had been 5.2 percent but over the first 16 weeks of the second half that had slowed to a 4.5 percent gain.
""In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance,"" Webster said.
Safeway said in its statement that if current rates of sales growth and inflation continued, profits in the final eight weeks of its year, which ends in March, might be affected.
Webster said it was ""very hard to judge"" whether the slowdown in sales would continue. ""We continue to see significant deflation in produce, which is 10 percent of total sales,"" he said.
He declined to give details of the impact on margins, however.

JoWinterbottom,"Tesco Plc became the latest British supermarket chain to put banking on its shopping list Thursday with plans for a venture with Royal Bank of Scotland.
Tesco said it will form the 50-50 joint venture in financial services with Royal Bank of Scotland, which will take over Tesco's interest-paying ClubCard Plus account for shoppers and launch a credit card as a first move over the summer.
Tesco expects the two companies to invest around 40 million British pounds ($65 million) during the first year in the venture.
Analysts said the move may help lessen rampant price-cutting by supermarkets competing for customers.
""With more supermarkets investing in financial services, there is less likelihood of a price war,"" said one industry analyst who asked not to be identified.
The new venture will most likely post a small loss in its first year but should turn a profit in the second or third year, marketing director Tim Mason said.
Mason said Tesco hoped to see similar profits eventually to those gained by retailer Marks &amp; Spencer from its financial services, which have been running for 15 years and brought in about 61 million pounds ($99 million) last year.
""If we didn't feel we could do that sort of level medium term, then we would not be as interested as we are,"" Mason said.
Tesco, which eclipsed J. Sainsbury as market leader in late 1995, becomes the third of Britain's four big supermarket chains to enter financial services.
Sainsbury, which was forced to launch its own ""frequent shopper"" card last year after the success of ClubCard, surprised the market by becoming the first of the big four supermarkets to plunge into banking when it announced plans for Sainsbury's Bank last year.
Sainsbury holds 55 percent in the bank while partner Bank of Scotland has 45 percent.
Safeway , the third largest grocery group, teamed up with Abbey National bank in November to launch banking services through its ABC loyalty card.
"
JoWinterbottom,"Tesco became the latest British supermarket to put banking on its shopping list on Thursday with plans for a venture with Royal Bank of Scotland, shifting the focus further from price, analysts said.
""With more supermarkets investing in financial services, there is less likelihood of a price war,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Tesco said it will set up a joint venture in financial services with Royal Bank which will take over Tesco's interest-paying ClubCard Plus account and launch a credit card as a first move over the summer.
The two companies, which will be equal partners in the venture, said the link-up would stretch over Direct Line telephone banking and Scottish Widows fund and life assurance group, which already has a strategic alliance with Royal Bank.
Tesco expects the two companies to invest around 40 million pounds ($65 million) during the first year in the venture, which does not need a banking licence.
The new venture could make a loss of between five and 10 million pounds in the first year, marketing director Tim Mason told Reuters, but should move to profits in the second or third.
Mason said Tesco hoped to see similar profits eventually to those gained by retailer Marks &amp; Spencer from its financial services, which have been running for some 15 years and brought in around 61 million pounds last year.
""If we didn't feel we could do that sort of level medium term, then we would not be as interested as we are,"" Mason said.
""Tesco views it as its chance to make Marks &amp; Spencer style financial services profits...the worry I have is that everybody is dashing in to this and as competition increases, prices could fall,"" said Dave Stoddart of Henderson Crosthwaite.
Tesco, which tipped rival J. Sainsbury off the market leader perch in late 1995, helped by the launch of its ClubCard loyalty scheme, is the third of the big four supermarkets to commit to financial services.
Tesco's partner in ClubCard Plus, National Westminster Bank, declined a further link-up because it did not need Tesco's distribution given its strong presence in Britain and wanted to keep a clear separate identity, a spokesman said.
Tesco's chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin resigned his place on NatWest's board on Thursday after over 15 years of tenure.
Sainsbury, which was forced to launch its own loyalty card last year after the success of ClubCard, surprised the market by becoming the first of the big four supermarkets to plunge into banking when it announced plans for Sainsbury's Bank last year.
Sainsbury holds 55 percent in the bank while partner Bank of Scotland has 45 percent.
Safeway, the third largest grocery group, teamed up with high street bank Abbey National in November to launch banking services through its ABC loyalty card.
But the intensifying battle on services and loyalty has triggered profits warnings at both Sainsbury and Safeway in the last month, as loyalty offers to attract more customers hurt margins while inflation and sales growth remain slow.
Shares in Tesco, whose 7.5 percent sales growth over the key Christmas period was ahead of both Sainsbury and Safeway, gained two pence to 340 pence by 1154 GMT while Sainsbury nosed up half a penny to 314-1/2 pence and Safeway rose 3-1/2 pence to 360.
ASDA, which prides itself on being the cheapest of the big four and has no nationwide loyalty card nor financial services link, saw shares slip a penny to 114 pence.
ASDA's strong sales growth has kept management reassured the company does not need to plunge into financial services while it focuses on price, but analysts said the shift in focus by its rivals could add pressure for ASDA to join in.
""It certainly seems to throw the ball into ASDA's court. They pride themselves on a simple price message but I think they will have to offer similar service extras at some time,"" the analyst said. ($1=.6128 Pound)

KarlPenhaul,"Manuel de Jesus Pena does not want to know who blew his legs off in an indiscriminate grenade attack last year -- he just wants the dirty war to stop.
Like thousands of other civilians in this northwest region of Uraba -- the most violent corner of Colombia -- Pena is caught in the crossfire of a bitter conflict between Marxist rebels, right-wing death squads and the army.
""I don't know if it was the guerrillas, the army or the paramilitaries. The important thing is that I survived and that I carry on living,"" Pena told Reuters as he sat in his one-room home in the regional center of Apartado. ""I would just tell the men of violence to stop this madness because those who are suffering are not directly involved in the war.""
In the last year alone, more than 2,000 people were killed in tit-for-tat political violence across Uraba. At least 350 of those deaths were in Apartado.
Of the dead, 51 were slain by gunmen of the left and right in seven cold-blooded massacres last year, according to figures compiled by Maria Girlesa Villegas, head of the Human Rights Ombudsman's office in Apartado.
Foreigners have not completely escaped the violence. A Russian cyclist was killed last year and a German and an Austrian tourist were kidnapped this year and later killed by guerrillas in the western part of the region.
PARAMILITARIES WAGE SCORCHED EARTH OFFENSIVE
The upsurge in violence in Uraba coincided with the political rise of the leftwing Patriotic Union (UP) party a decade ago, culminating in its victory in mayoral elections in the region's main towns in 1992.
Spawned from a failed government peace process, the UP was seen by detractors on the right as the political wing of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest rebel army, formed as a pro-Soviet force in 1964.
In a ""fire and blood"" offensive, paramilitaries drove the UP and what they saw as other potential rebel sympathizers from the north and south of Uraba. For the past year they have focused on the central zone, known as the ""banana belt.""
Jose Herman, a UP leader who fled Apartado last October, is convinced the paramilitaries have forged a covert pact with the army and the banana companies to spearhead a scorched earth policy aimed at annihilating leftists in the region.
""There's strong links between the banana companies and the paramilitaries. Their theory was to take the water away from the fish and they began to kill us, calling us guerrilla collaborators,"" he said, adding that although UP and the FARC shared many ideals their command structures were separate.
REBELS IN IDEOLOGICAL ABOUT-FACE
In a confusing ideological about-face, the FARC's former allies, the Maoist-inspired People's Liberation Army (EPL), are now their bitter enemies. Most EPL fighters laid down their arms in 1991 and went on to form the Hope, Peace and Liberty political movement, which now dominates the main banana workers' union Sintrainagro.
But some former EPL rebels joined the ranks of the paramilitary death squads, sparking reprisals by the FARC against all Hope, Peace and Liberty members. ""The abuses were committed by the FARC and now they're paying the price,"" said Hernan Correa, a Sintrainagro leader and former EPL insurgent.
Underlying the bitter sectarian rivalry is the battle for economic control of this strategic region nestled between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans near the border with Panama. The military say it is a key transit route for drugs and arms.
Some local experts believe the only real hope for an end to the killing is for one side or the other to drive its rival out of the area. But for the moment none of the armed actors has the firepower to fight a classic war of positions and hold on to the territory it gains -- not even the army.
""We lack mobility. We need more budget for arms, ammunition and helicopters. We only have three helicopters here. If they just gave me 10 more then I'm sure that within less than six months we would finish this problem,"" regional army commander Gen. Rito Alejo del Rio said.
But no argument will convince one 18-year-old police rookie, who arrived in the town the day before the FARC killed 11 people with a massive car-bomb in February, that this is a war worth fighting and even less one that can be won.
""This is war of the mad, the demented and the psychopaths,"" he said.
"
KarlPenhaul,"The explosion that killed an inmate in Bogota's top-security La Picota prison points to a brewing internecine war between jailed members of the notorious Medellin drug cartel, a prison source said on Monday.
William Infante, a convicted contract killer formerly in the pay of the now-defunct Medellin mob, died late on Saturday when a bomb he was making in his cell exploded.
A source in the National Prison Institute (INPEC) said investigators believe Infante, who was serving a 25-year term for the murder of a leftist politician, was preparing an attack on fellow prisoner Leonidas Vargas, an ally of the late head of the Medellin cartel's ""military wing.""
""We are investigating the possibility of vendettas between former members of the Medellin cartel jailed in La Picota. It seems the bomb may have been intended for Leonidas Vargas,"" the source said. He ruled out press speculation the bomb may have been destined for the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers and other capos of the Cali cartel jailed in an adjoining wing of La Picota.
""There is no way this device could have been used against Cali cartel members because there is no way the Medellin convicts can get through to where the Cali cartel chiefs are held. The two wings are completely separate,"" he said.
Investigations are under way to find out what type of explosive was used and how it was smuggled into the jail, supposedly the most secure in Colombia.
The prison source said the reason for the dispute between Infante and Vargas was not yet clear. Both had once been close to Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, alias The Mexican, the strategist behind a bloody campaign of bombings and killings that infamous cartel chief Pablo Escobar waged against his rivals and the state.
Rodriguez Gacha died in a shootout with police in 1989. The Medellin cartel was effectively destroyed with the death of Escobar in a roof-top shootout four years later.
In a radio interview on Monday, Justice Minister Carlos Medellin warned that chronic overcrowding in Colombia's jails had created a ""seedbed"" for corruption and disorder. Last week, 2,000 inmates led by convicted leftist rebels rioted in La Modelo prison, Bogota's other top-security jail, and there have been at least three other serious riots in provincal prisons this year.
""The National Prisons Institute's inability to control the situation has created a seedbed for corruption and disorder ... it would not be surprising to see problems flaring in other jails,"" Medellin told the Caracol radio network.
He said President Ernesto Samper may declare a state of internal emergency, which would allow the government to push through new laws to beef up prison security and cut overcrowding.
In addition to the lack of security in Colombian prisons, as evidenced by the recent riots, U.S. anti-drug officials allege that corruption among prison guards is rife. They say Colombia's jailed drug lords continue to run their multibillion-dollar criminal empires from behind bars.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Hundreds more families are continuing to flee violence through the jungles of northwest Colombia, adding to a burgeoning refugee crisis in the town of Mutata, its mayor said on Tuesday.
At least 2,500 people arrived in a village close to Mutata in the violence-torn Uraba region over Easter, and Mayor Luis Renteria said another 1,500 mostly women and children were expected to arrive in the next few days.
In the first international response to the drama, a British embassy official said on Tuesday that Britain's Overseas Development Agency had approved an $80,000 emergency aid package of tents and food supplies, due to be sent to the region before the weekend.
The army has accused Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas of ordering the peasants to abandon their homes in the Rio Salaqui basin of neighbouring Choco province in order to create ""social disorder"" in the main towns of Uraba.
But a FARC spokeswoman said the people had fled in the face of ""indiscriminate"" aerial bombardments by the army and threats from right-wing paramilitary groups.
""These people say they will not return home until they have guarantees from the government that paramilitary groups will be forced out of their communities,"" Renteria said.
He said one-third of the refugees in Pavarando, in the municipality of Mutata, were children, and that more than 80 women who spent up to four weeks walking from their homes along treacherous jungle tracks were pregnant.
A British embassy official said tents and food would be purchased locally and channelled to the refugees via the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The human tide of refugees has drawn an angry response from army commander Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett, who said: ""The guerrilla strategy is to force these people to move out and occupy towns to create a huge social problem.""
But a FARC spokeswoman told Reuters: ""We have been in contact with our people in the area and they say there has been intense fighting with the army. Because the army has not been able to wipe out the guerrilla it has staged indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the area.""
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa and provincial governor Alvaro Uribe are scheduled to visit the refugees in Mutata on Wednesday.
Uraba, which covers parts of Choco, Antioquia and Cordoba provinces, is the scene of bitter conflict between the army and the guerrillas. The army says it is a key arms and drug smuggling route for the rebels, while the guerrillas say right-wing forces are trying to force peasants out of the strategically important, resource-rich region close to the border with Panama.
There are an estimated 7,000 internal refugees spread across Uraba and more than 900,000 people have been displaced in the last decade by Colombia's long-running guerrilla war.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Foreign and Colombian journalists have received death threats from suspected drug gangsters claiming to be ""extraditables,"" a source at Colombia's national intelligence service said on Tuesday.
Extraditables was a name used by the late cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar and members of his now-defunct Medellin cartel as they waged a campaign of bombings and kidnappings in the late 1980s and early 1990s in a successful bid to force the government to ban the extradition of drug traffickers.
In letters sent to some newspaper editors and foreign press agencies in the last week, the group pledged to kill journalists who backed renewed government efforts to overturn Colombia's 6-year-old ban on sending its citizens abroad to stand trial.
""With your 'yes' to extradition you have signed the death penalty. Because from today, you, your families and your companies have been declared military targets,"" said the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. ""Now you will feel the meaning of power ... Remember this sentence has no time limit.""
The document ended with ""We prefer a tomb in Colombia than a jail in the United States,"" a phrase coined by Escobar's extraditables at the height of their war, which ended with the government banning the extradition of all Colombians in 1991.
Intelligence officials are investigating the threats and do not yet know if surviving members of the Medellin mob or other drug traffickers such as the rival Cali cartel may be involved.
""We're analysing these letters sent to newspaper editors and foreign journalists but at the moment we have not been able to determine how serious the risk is,"" an intelligence service spokesman said. He declined to name the journalists who received the threats.
The threats come after Justice Minister Carlos Medellin said he would press to lift the ban on extradition with retroactive effect. If he succeeds it would raise the possibility that the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, the jailed capos of the Cali drug cartel, could eventually face trial in the United States.
Washington has been pressing Colombia to restore extradition, saying Colombian anti-drug laws are too lax and traffickers continue running their criminal empires from behind bars.
The new threats also follow recent attacks against journalists. In December, a car bomb exploded near the home of a regional newspaper editor in Medellin and last month gunmen murdered Gerardo Bedoya, a leading journalist with El Pais newspaper in Cali, home to the drug mob that replaced the Medellin cartel as the world's leading cocaine supplier.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Thousands of people who fled violence and were camped out in the jungles of northwest Colombia may soon run out of food and the risk of epidemics was on the rise, a Red Cross aid worker said on Wednesday.
More than 3,000 people, mostly women and children, were sleeping under hastily constructed shelters or in the open air in a village close to the town of Mutata, in the violence-torn Uraba region.
Many worried about the fate of as many as 1,500 relatives believed to making their way along treacherous jungle tracks, fleeing the fighting between leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the army in the Rio Salaqui basin of neighbouring Choco province, the aide said.
""We are rationing food for these displaced people because of the lack of supplies. We just don't know how long the food we have will last,"" said Adalberto Arrieta, of the Red Cross in the regional centre of Apartado.
""We're carrying out preventative work but in these kinds of conditions of poor hygiene, epidemics inevitably follow. There are just too many people in one place,"" he said.
Multiple cases of diarrhoea and fever were reported and Arrieta said the refugees also risked malaria and cholera.
The British government was sending $80,000 in emergency aid, including food and tents, to Uraba, which covers parts of Choco, Antioquia and Cordoba provinces. But Colombian officials admitted they were ill-prepared to deal with the human tide.
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa and provincial governors travelled to Mutata on Wednesday to plan government relief aid.
The army, meanwhile, was trying to persuade the people to return home or at least prevent them from moving from the village of Pavorando to the main town of Mutata.
Army commander Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett accused the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas of ordering the mass mobilisation of peasants to create ""social chaos"" in the main towns of the area.
A FARC spokeswoman said this week that the peasants were fleeing in the face of indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the army coupled with threats from right-wing death squads.
""We want everything back to normal but we cannot go home until all those paramilitary groups leave,"" Robinson Polo, one of the displaced, told the NTC TV news programme.
Across the Uraba region, some 7,000 people have been displaced by fighting. In the last decade, the government said more than 900,000 people were forced to abandon their homes as a result of the country's long-running guerrilla war.
The army has waged an offensive against the guerrillas in Uraba in a bid to disrupt what it claims are key arms and drug trafficking routes in and out of nearby Panama.
The guerrillas, however, say the army and the paramilitaries are waging a joint scorched earth policy to force peasants out of the strategic, resource-rich region.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Pools of blood stain a dirt track that winds through the lush banana plantations of this central region, Uraba.
The bodies of two slain workers are unceremoniously dumped in the back of a truck and shipped off to the morgue, leaving heavily armed police to search for the killers amid trees laden with fruit destined for the United States and Europe.
For the last decade the banana has been synonymous with the bullet as rightwing paramilitaries and leftist guerrillas vie for the shifting allegiance of the people of this violence-torn corner of northwest Colombia. The dirty war now in full swing is just the latest chapter in the history of an industry which, for the last 30 years, has shaped politics, the economy and society in the four municipalities that make up Colombia's ""banana belt.""
""When people enjoy a banana in Europe, remember there's the pain of a whole people behind it,"" said Gloria Cuartas, mayor of the regional center of Apartado.
In the past banana workers' unions were inextricably tied to two guerrilla groups, the Maoist People's Liberation Army (EPL) and pro-Soviet Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), creating open conflict with plantation bosses.
But most EPL fighters laid down their arms under a government-backed peace initiative in 1991 and went on to form a political movement called Esperanza, Paz y Libertad (Hope, Peace and Liberty). That movement now controls the union Sintrainagro with 13,000 members, an estimated 95 percent of banana workers in the area.
RELATIONS WITH BOSSES RARELY BETTER
Relations between the bosses of the 380 plantations spread across more than 69,000 acres (28,000 hectares) and their workers have rarely been better. Labor protest has been muted and the workers have won vastly improved contract terms enabling them to earn up to $300 per month, almost twice the minimum wage, as they harvest the more than 1 million tonnes of bananas exported annually from the region.
But the FARC's power in the plantations has plummeted with the demise of the union it once sponsored and in the face of the burgeoning influence of Hope, Peace and Liberty. In a bid to regain a foothold, the rebels have targeted banana workers and Hope, Peace and Liberty members in particular.
""Now instead of having the support of the guerrillas we're their target,"" said Hernan Correa, a Sintrainagro leader whose brother was assassinated by suspected FARC gunmen last year. Correa, a former EPL guerrilla, has himself been the target of at least one assassination attempt and now rides around in an armor-plated pickup truck.
But the movement has not stood by and watched its members die. ""Some members of Hope, Peace and Liberty took the personal decision to take up arms to defend themselves ... the guerrillas committed the abuses and now they're paying the price,"" Correa said.
MORE THAN 3,000 DEAD SINCE 1989
Since 1989, 20 Sintrainagro leaders and more than 3,000 rank and file party members have been killed, Correa said. The names of banana estates Bajo El Oso, Osaka, Los Cunas and Mapana toll like a church bell in the minds of many residents of the banana belt. Almost everyone had a relative or friend among the 51 people slaughtered in a string of massacres on those estates between August 1995 and February 1996.
Critics say Hope, Peace and Liberty has gone beyond self-defense and forged a pact with the army and banana growers, specifically the region's seven main banana exporters including Banadex, a subsidiary of the multinational Standard Fruit, to create right-wing death squads.
""In Apartado they want us to end up in the hands of the multinationals and they want the peasants out (to gain access to) the oil, coal and bananas and the right to the humble peasants' land,"" Cuartas said.
Regional army commander Gen. Rito Alejo del Rio rejects claims of any such covert plot. ""Hope, Peace and Liberty has strengthened the banana industry and the regional economy through excellent labor and business relations. With the links between the union, the growers and the army there is no interest apart from the stability of the zone,"" he said.
He accuses Cuartas of being an ally of the FARC and the Patriotic Union (UP), widely seen as the rebels' political wing. He believes that while the rebels wage a military campaign Apartado's mayor is waging a potentially disastrous war of economic attrition aimed at encouraging banana importing nations to clamp sanctions on Uraba.
""In 1997 NGOs (non-government organizations) will try to convince importing countries not to buy Colombian bananas on the grounds that they're financing paramilitary groups. Cutting down the sale of bananas will lead the community to the border of chaos,"" Del Rio said.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Convicts leading a riot, in which at least five guards died, demanded on Friday to be flown out of a jail in northern Colombia by helicopter to an undisclosed location, the regional human rights ombudsman said.
The inmates, some convicted leftist guerrillas and others former police officers, requested 10 parachutes, while one man, a jailed leader of the now defunct M-19 rebel group, demanded political exile in Cuba, ombudsman Carmen Quintero said.
About 550 prisoners seized control of the jail compound in Valledupar, in Cesar province, after taking weapons from prison guards on Thursday evening.
A National Prison Institute (INPEC) spokeswoman said the prisoners had taken 16 hostages, including the jail's deputy director and a 14-year-old girl.
""The prisoners are demanding vehicles to leave the jail and two helicopters with 10 parachutes. They have not said where they want to fly to but said they would take the hostages with them as a guarantee,"" Quintero told reporters outside the jail.
Provincial governor Mauricio Pimiento, part of the delegation trying to mediate the crisis, said he would not discuss the inmates' demands until they had freed their hostages and allowed all the dead and injured to be removed from the compound.
""A prisoner has reported that five guards are dead...,"" a spokeswoman for the prison said.
The inmates allowed an ambulance into the prison for some of the five inmates and jail guards injured in the initial shootout.
Police and soldiers surrounded the prison and fired bullets and tear gas over the walls but were ordered not to enter for fear of inflaming the situation, the spokeswoman said.
""We are holding our fire and have merely formed three security cordons around the jail,"" a police spokesman later told Reuters by phone from Valledupar.
Col. Rafael Pardo, head of national prisons, said there was no independent confirmation of the number of dead and injured because inmates had barred the security forces from entering the jail.
In addition to the small group of prisoners looking to break out of the jail, other inmates are demanding an end to prison overcrowding and improved living conditions.
The Valledupar prison is designed to house 200 convicts but more than 550 are imprisoned there. Earlier this week, Justice Minister Carlos Medellin admitted chronic overcrowding had turned Colombia's jails into a ""seedbed for corruption and violence.""
Across Colombia, 40,000 inmates are housed in facilities designed for 30,000 prisoners.
If news of the deaths was confirmed, it would be the worst in a string of prison disturbances this year. Last week, more than 2,000 inmates, led by leftist guerrillas, rioted and started fires in Bogota's La Modelo jail in protest at prison overcrowding.
Another convict died in the top-security wing of Bogota's La Picota jail when a bomb he was making in his cell exploded. Prisoners have rioted in at least three provincial jails so far this year.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Government officials flew to northern Colombia on Friday in a bid to persuade prisoners to lay down their weapons and release hostages seized in a bloody jail riot, which left four guards confirmed dead.
A crack anti-kidnap force, meanwhile, took up positions around the jail and a local police chief raised the possibility of launching a lightning operation to rescue the hostages.
A group of 10 hardened convicts heading the revolt refused to budge on earlier demands for two helicopters to airlift them out of the jail in Valledupar, in Cesar province, and take them to an undisclosed location, the city mayor said.
At least one of the men, a former leader of the now-defunct M-19 leftist rebel movement, called for political asylum in Cuba.
""I would urge the prisoners to be patient and avoid any further bloodshed. We are on our way to the jail (from Bogota) and want to look for a peaceful solution to this grave problem,"" said government human rights ombudsman Jose Fernando Castro, who is heading the mediation team.
About 550 inmates went on a rampage on Thursday evening and seized control of the jail after overpowering 18 guards and confiscating their pistols and nightsticks. Police said leftist guerrillas and four former policemen jailed for kidnapping and extortion are heading the disturbance.
A spokeswoman for the National Prisons Institute originally said five guards were reported killed in the shoot-out and a handful of convicts had been injured. By Friday morning, Valledupar mayor Tito Pumarejo confirmed that four bodies, all prison guards, had been ferried out of the jail compound by Red Cross workers.
The INPEC spokeswoman said the final death toll may be higher, adding that security forces were still unable to enter the jail.
A Valledupar police commander, Col. Alvaro Becerra, said about 100 police and troops had formed three security cordons around the jail and said there was a ""tense but calm stand-off.""
""It would be difficult to mount an operation to rescue the hostages. It would require a great deal of planning. But an elite GAULA (anti-kidnap) squad is in place and a combined police and army strike is a possibility,"" he told Reuters by phone.
""But the inmates' demands are absolutely absurd and I don't think they will be granted,"" he added.
The inmates are holding at least 15 hostages, including a 14-year-old girl who was visiting the jail when the riot erupted, and the prison's deputy director. The majority of the prisoners restricted their demands to an end to overcrowding and better conditions.
The riot in Valledupar jail, built for 200 inmates and not the current 550 it houses, is the latest in a series of disturbances in Colombian jails.
Three provincial prisons were rocked by riots earlier this year. In the last 10 days, 2,000 inmates, led by convicted guerrillas, smashed part of Bogota's La Modelo jail while an inmate died in Bogota's top-security La Picota facility when a bomb he was making in his cell accidentally exploded.
Chronic overcrowding is broadly considered to be the main cause of the riots. More than 40,000 prisoners are crammed into facilities designed for 30,000 people, the INPEC spokeswoman said.
"
KarlPenhaul,"President Ernesto Samper on Friday called on prisoners who seized a jail in northern Colombia to lay down their weapons and release their hostages following a bloody riot that left four guards dead.
He warned that negotiations to end the prison siege in Valledupar in northern Cesar province could not begin until a group of 10 hardened convicts heading the revolt by 550 prisoners, surrendered.
A crack anti-kidnap force was in place near the jail and a local police chief did not rule out the possibility of launching a lightning operation to rescue the hostages.
""The national government will not begin to look for the solution to this situation until the hostages are released and the inmates lay down their arms,"" Samper told reporters after an official event in the industrial city of Medellin.
""I call on the prisoners not to make the situation more difficult and to contribute to a rapid end to this conflict with the guarantee that their lives will be respected,"" he said.
The prisoners released a 14-year-old girl and a prison administrator earlier on Friday, but were still holding 13 hostages by nightfall.
The inmates went on a rampage on Thursday evening and took control of the jail after overpowering 18 guards, confiscating their pistols and nightsticks. Police said leftist guerrillas and four former policemen, jailed for kidnapping and extortion, were leading the disturbance.
Four prison guards were confirmed dead. A national Prisons' Institute official said the death toll could be higher but security forces had been unable to enter the compound to check.
The ringleaders refused to budge on demands for two helicopters to airlift them out of the jail to an undisclosed location, city mayor Tito Pumarejo said. At least one of the men has called for political asylum in Cuba. The majority of the prisoners restricted their demands to an end to overcrowding and better conditions.
Valledupar police commander Col. Alvaro Becerra said 100 police and troops had formed three security cordons around the jail and said there was a ""tense, but calm stand-off.""
The riot in Valledupar jail, built for 200 inmates, not the 550 it houses, comes against the backdrop of a string of disturbances in Colombian jails. Three provincial prisons have been rocked by riots this year.
"
KarlPenhaul,"A judge who ordered the arrest of Colombia's army chief was criticised on Thursday for giving in to pressure from leftist guerrillas mounting their most serious offensive in decades.
The judge in southern Caqueta province served the warrant against Gen. Harold Bedoya after the army refused to lift barricades blocking a demonstration by thousands of peasants opposed to the compulsory eradication of coca plantations.
Colombian landowners and political commentators said leftist rebels linked to cocaine traffickers had leaned on the judge to order the general's arrest.
""Who was behind the warrant? It's not difficult to guess because it's no secret that these are regions where the local authorities and the peasants are operating under pressure from the narcoguerrillas,"" the influential Colombian Cattlemen's Federation said in a statement.
Alejandro Ramirez, the local judge in the town of Albania, issued the arrest warrant against Bedoya last week. The general faces 30 days in prison for defying an earlier order to remove the barricades.
President Ernesto Samper ordered an inquiry on Wednesday into the judge's decision, which was under review by a higher court.
The government said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest left-wing guerrilla organisation, was behind the peasant demonstration.
The legal controversy came in the middle of one of the bloodiest offensives since the FARC and another rebel group, the National Liberation Army, were founded in the mid-1960s.
In two weeks of rebel attacks more than 120 people were killed, most of them soldiers. More than 60 soldiers were being held as ""prisoners of war"" by the FARC.
El Tiempo, Colombia's leading daily, attacked the judge decision as absurd.
""What could be more inconceivable and absurd than jailing the commander of the army in the middle of this war?"" the newspaper's deputy director Enrique Santos said in a column.
""... of all the Machiavellian plots by drug traffickers and guerrillas, the sanction ordered by the judge of Albania beats all previous records by far,"" he wrote on Thursday.
The Colombian Cattlemen's Federation said the country's economy and legal system should be put on a war footing to meet the demands of an effective counterinsurgency campaign.
The government, buffeted by the wave of leftist guerrilla violence, has called for a hefty increase in defence spending in its 1997 budget, government sources said on Thursday.
They said most of the increase would go toward military spending, with more than $420 million coming from a proposed sale of war bonds to rich Colombians next year.

KarlPenhaul,"BOGOTA, April 23 Reuter - Colombia will draw heavily on its coffee stockpiles to meet export commitments, given that the 1996/97 harvest seems set to come in lower than previous estimates of 10.4 million 60-kg bags, the country's coffee czar Jorge Cardenas said this week.
Many private exporters and independent analysts, however, believe that much of the powerful National Coffee Growers' Federation's stocks are old crop or even beans that have been damaged by the so-called ""broca"" or berry borer - thereby making much of it unfit for export.
Gloomy harvest predictions by federation head Cardenas coincided with a report in Colombia's leading political magazine Semana that said serious underlying structural problems were the prime cause behind falling production levels.
In an impromptu press conference after the weekly federation meeting Monday, Cardenas said the 1996/97 harvest would come in at little over 10 million 60-kg bags. He predicted coffee inventories would drop to 3.5 million bags from current levels of about five million bags by the end of September this year as Colombia sought to meet export schedules.
He declined to comment on independent sources' claims that much of the stocks were old.
Quoting a range of experts, Semana magazine said the gradual fall in coffee output was due to the progressive aging of coffee plantations or because growers were abandoning them altogether.
A separate report in the respected El Espectador daily newspaper cited National Statistics Department figures saying that the dismal 0.21 percent growth rate of the agricultural sector in 1996 was largely due to the poor performance of coffee, with an 18.5 percent drop in production.
Also at Monday's federation meeting, the organization's technical director Antonio Herron, warned that ""broca"" was continuing to spread and could affect all Colombia's 900,000 hectares of coffee by 1999. At present about 680,000 hectares are affected by broca, about 75 percent of the country's plantations.
Federation officials previously said growers were managing to keep broca in check thanks to a vigorous TV advertising campaign. Growers themselves complain that the fight against broca has pushed up production costs.
The federation estimates that about five percent of the 1996/97 coffee crop will be damaged by broca -- a little more than 500,000 60-kg sacks -- further forcing down the amount of excelso coffee available for export.
The prevailing gloom was partially lifted by predictions by U.S. brokerage Merrill Lynch that international coffee prices could stay high until September.
Cardenas predicted July-September coffee prices would rise to somewhere around current spot May levels because of continuing supply jitters in the international markets.
A second bright point came at the end of last week with the negotiated end to a five-day truck drivers' strike, which Cardenas said had done ""a lot of damage to coffee flows"" and delayed shipment of 200,000 70-kg bags.

KarlPenhaul,"Moves to secure the release of about 60 Colombian soldiers held by leftist guerrillas could be hampered by failure to agree on the international character of a team to mediate the handover, a Red Cross spokesman said on Monday.
""Perhaps the most complicated element (of creating a mediation commission) is whether to view it as a national or an international issue,"" a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
""The important thing for us is that these people are released as quickly as possible and in good health.""
Just one day before the deadline set by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for creation of the commission, the guerrillas have still not nominated their own delegates to oversee the release of the prisoners, captured during a raid in southern Putumayo province on Aug. 30.
In a telephone interview on Monday, Marco Leon Calarca, part of the FARC's general secretariat based in Mexico, said they would propose Guatemalan Nobel prize winner Rigoberta Menchu.
But it was uncertain how far the government would allow the FARC to use the release of the prisoners as a chance to publicise its guerrilla war to an international audience. Some analysts believe the FARC wants to use the release to show it is a genuine guerrilla army, not terrorists and drug traffickers as charged by Colombia's government and military.
But the government is keen to treat its fight against left-wing guerrillas as a largely domestic affair and it has insisted there is nothing to negotiate when it comes to the prisoners' release.
""We want to set up a commission that carries real weight so that the government is forced to create the right conditions for the handover,"" Leon Calarca said. ""We want both an international and national presence.""
Once the commission is formed it will negotiate the timetable for the soldiers' release and witness the handover.
The troops were seized in an attack on a jungle camp in Las Delicias in which 27 soldiers were killed. It marked the start of one of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives in decades.
The government has nominated three people to the panel, Bishop of Bogota Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, former Foreign Minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo and ex-Sen. Alvaro Leyva.
"
KarlPenhaul,"A former justice minister said on Monday that Colombia's moves to lift a six-year extradition ban were a smokescreen designed to appease the United States while protecting the country's drug barons.
""This government has no real desire to push extradition through but it wants to give the impression that it does ... We must not underestimate (President Ernesto) Samper's bad faith and capacity for trickery,"" former justice minister Enrique Parejo told Reuters.
Samper reiterated on Monday his commitment to seeing an end to the constitutional ban on sending Colombians to stand trial abroad, saying ""it forms part of our policies in the international struggle against drugs"".
But Parejo believes Samper is merely paying lip service to the idea of extradition to placate the United States, which blacklisted Colombia for a second consecutive year for its perceived failure to crack down on drug trafficking.
A Senate committee is due to re-open a government- sponsored debate on extradition on Tuesday following a confusing session last week, which ended in a hung vote and left legislators and ministers arguing over congressional rules.
Even if one of three extradition proposals due for debate clears all congressional hurdles and makes it onto the statute books, Parejo believes it would be so complex as to be unworkable.
The alternatives range from the simple abrogation of Article 35 from the constitution -- the one banning extradition of Colombian nationals -- to one that includes widespread restrictions on when extradition could be applied.
""This is all part of a manoeuvre by the government. Even if some form of extradition is passed then it will really amount to nothing because there will be so many regulations that these would frustrate the whole process,"" Parejo said.
Extradition was banned in 1991 after Pablo Escobar, the late head of the notorious Medellin drug cartel, launched a spate of bombings and kidnappings against the state.
When Samper took office in August 1994, amid allegations that he financed his election campaign with donations from the Cali drug mob, he said restoration of extradition was not on his political agenda.
Samper and his top ministers have reversed that position in the face of increasing pressure from the United States, which has consistently pressed for extradition of the jailed Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, former chiefs of the notorious Cali cartel.
But Parejo believes Samper is now giving verbal backing to the restoration of extradition safe in the knowledge that Colombian law makes it virtually impossible to apply new legislation retroactively.
"
KarlPenhaul,"President Ernesto Samper, moving to reverse Colombia's status as an international drug pariah, urged Congress on Tuesday to quickly approve tougher anti-narcotics laws.
Samper submitted legislation in mid-July to stiffen sentences for drug trafficking and to permit the confiscation of drug barons' property, but the measures are still tied up in Congress.
""I ask Congress to give urgent consideration to this (anti-drug) proposal,"" Samper said in a letter to lawmakers.
He said the judicial reforms ""reflect the government's unequivocal commitment to end drug trafficking and organised crime"" and would ""bring national laws into line with international parameters on drug trafficking and money laundering as laid down by the United Nations.""
By speeding up the measures, government officials say Samper has his eye on restoring Washington's faith in Colombia's anti-narcotics efforts.
Washington decertified Colombia as a partner in the global struggle against drugs in March, branding it a virtual outcast state. The government hopes to regain U.S. certification in March 1997, a government source said.
Political analysts have noted that no country decertified by Washington has ever had the measure lifted, however, and Samper's alleged ties to drug lords weigh strongly against any move by the Clinton administration to let Colombia off the hook.
Fabio Ochoa, the youngest of a drug trafficking family linked to the once-powerful Medellin cartel, was released from prison on Monday after less than six years behind bars.
U.S. drug experts have criticised the light sentences imposed on Colombian drug barons and say they continue to run their illicit activities from jail.
Samper initially said the tougher sentencing could mean convicted drug traffickers spending up to 60 years in prison. But in the bill presented to Congress, the maximum sentence envisaged adds up to little more than one-third of that term.
Despite Samper's push to regain U.S. certification, he has not yet submitted any bill that would reestablish extradition for drug traffickers. An extradition treaty with the United States was suspended with a constitutional reform in 1991, introduced against the background of a campaign of terror waged by major drug barons in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

KarlPenhaul,"BOGOTA, May 14 Reuter - Colombia's coffee czar finally admitted this week what private exporters have been saying for months -- that the country will have ""enormous difficulties"" meeting export schedules.
Jorge Cardenas, head of the powerful National Coffee Growers' Federation, blamed the situation on supply worries caused by a best-case forecast of a 10.2 million 60-kg bag crop for the 1996/97 coffee year -- compared to 12.9 million bags last year.
Implicit in his admission was that the federation's inventories, currently at 4.8 million bags according to latest federation figures, contain insufficient fresh coffee to meet this year's 11 million bags of export commitments.
The situation has left the federation battling with private exporters at home in a bid to cash in on booming international prices.
""There's very strong competition for fresh coffee,"" Cardenas said. He added that in some areas, 125-kg loads of coffee were being sold for more than $400 compared to the benchmark domestic price of 388,375 pesos (about $360), set each week by the federation.
As early as February, some private exporters said the federation's crop estimate of 10.4 million bags was overblown.
Expert analysts at Merill Lynch issued a forecast of about 9.5 million bags and one private exporter consulted over the weekend said it could even come in as low as 9.3 million bags based on an April crop of about 824,000 bags compared to the 1 million bags initially forecast.
The exporter added that figures obtained from federation sources showed federation stocks of fresh coffee amounted to just 800,000 bags, with the remainder affected by the berry borer, or ""broca"", or old crop coffee dating from between 1991 and 1995.
""We've known about this situation for a long time. The only thing that was left was for Jorge Cardenas to say it,"" the private exporter told Reuters.
He stopped short of accusing the federation of lying about its stocks to avoid panicking the markets. Instead, he argued that the federation had played down the magnitude of the shortfall in the hope of lulling Colombia's exporters into a false sense of security while frantically trying to snap up all the available fresh crop.
""The federation hoped that by restricting us it would be able to buy more coffee but it hasn't been able to do that,"" the exporter said.
Until this week Cardenas said the federation would be fully able to meet its commitments by drawing on its stockpile. But at the end of the federation's weekly meeting Cardenas said the shipment of about 100,000 bags of April exports alone had been delayed because of supply shortfalls.
Worries about short coffee supplies are prompting speculation that major coffee producers may delay a decision over tighter export quotas at an Association of Coffee Producing Countries ACPC meeting in London next week.
The export program currently in force is aimed at capping the 14 member nations' exports at 25.48 million bags in the first half of 1997. But Cardenas hinted this week that he would be ready to put any fresh decision on hold.
""The producers' desire is to send a signal to the markets and there's no question of having prices at a certain level just for the sake of it or of creating artificial conditions,"" Cardenas said.
Smaller than expected crops in many Latin American countries -- most notably second-largest producer Colombia, the onset of winter in Brazil and low inventory levels in consumer countries have all contributed to fuel a five-month upswing in coffee futures.

"
KarlPenhaul,"Former Colombian president Virgilio Barco Vargas died on Tuesday in a Bogota clinic after a yearlong battle with stomach cancer and Alzheimer's disease, hospital officials said. He was 75.
Barco, a shy public figure but a tough politician and a skilled administrator, emerged from relative political obscurity to lead Colombia from 1986 to 1990.
""I share the sense of loss that all Colombians are feeling. Barco was a man of few but firm convictions and very dedicated to certain principles,"" President Ernesto Samper said in a radio broadcast tribute to Barco.
""I think he really was an example for the new generation,"" Samper, a Liberal Party member like Barco, added.
Barco's body was due to lie in state at the national Congress building. The government of his home province of Norte de Santander declared three days of mourning.
Barco was born in 1921 in the northeast town of Cucuta, on the border with Venezuela. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in civil engineering and later a doctorate in economic science.
Married to an American, Barco had a perfect command of English and is popularly remembered as one of Bogota's best- ever mayors between 1966 and 1969 when he promoted a series of major public works and urban renovation programmes.
He also served as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Agriculture in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
He was, however, ill-at-ease with the press and seen as a poor orator. Shortly after his election as president the Colombian media described him as resembling a ""disheveled, absent-minded and stuttering professor.""
Barco swept to power in the elections of May 1986 with more than 58 percent of the votes, one of the largest margins in Colombian history. He was committed to fighting poverty and promoting indigenous and children's rights.
But his administration saw drug-related violence soar to bloody heights. In the build-up to the 1990 presidential elections three candidates were shot to death, including presidential front-runner Carlos Galan -- gunned down by a drug cartel assassin at a rally just outside Bogota.
The president responded by restoring the extradition of Colombians to the United States, which had effectively been suspended by Supreme Court rulings in 1986 and 1987.
His a frontal challenge to the drug traffickers led Pablo Escobar, head of the Medellin cartel, to dub him ""Mr. Shit,"" according to journalist Simon Strong's book Whitewash.
Barco partly succeeded in his efforts to defuse Colombia's long-running guerrilla war. He negotiated a peace treaty with the leftist M-19 guerrilla group and opened the way for former guerrillas to return to civilian life.
But a tentative peace accord with the country's largest guerrilla army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was short-lived.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Colombia's Senate approved on Thursday a controversial bill that would partially lift the country's six-year-old ban on the extradition of drug traffickers and other criminals.
A plenary session voted 53-14 in favour of the bill, which still faces more congressional hurdles and if successful would only become a statute toward the end of the year.
""I'm very satisfied because we had a big vote in favour of the motion,"" Justice Minister Almabeatriz Rengifo said after the session. ""This will be the last step to removing a constitutional ban (on extradition) which is what we have been fighting to do.""
Critics, however, say the original government-sponsored bill has been so watered down that it is virtually useless and is unlikely to impress U.S. anti-drug officials who have been pushing the Colombian government to push through an unconditional extradition law.
The bill must still be submitted to two more debates in the Lower House of Congress before June 20 and four more after mid-July.
If it survives intact it would forbid extradition if alleged criminals surrender to the Colombian authorities or if they face tougher penalties abroad than they would under the notoriously lenient Colombian justice system.
There are clear signs the proposal faces a rough passage in the Lower House where a similar bill foundered late last year.
""We're not in favour of a totally free or licentious extradition law. Nobody believes in the Gringos indictments with their false witnesses and everything else,"" said Giovanni Lamboglia, Liberal Party member and chairman of the Chamber of Representatives. He said he would be pressing for the bill to be watered down even further.
Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia, a respected member of President Ernesto Samper's cabinet remained optimistic and said the government would likely press to toughen the proposal after July 20 and even consider whether it could be applied retroactively.
The vote came on the day Virgilio Barco, former president who led his country through one of the most violent periods of drug-related violence in the nation's troubled history, was buried in Bogota. The 75-year-old statesman died on Tuesday after a year-long battle with stomach cancer.
As president between 1986 and 1990, Barco is the only Colombian leader to have ordered the extradition of one of the country's top drug lords to the United States.
He bundled Carlos Lehder, one of the masterminds of the infamous Medellin drug mob, off to a U.S. court in 1987 where a judge sentenced him to life without parole plus 135 years.
The move was one of the catalysts that led Pablo Escobar, the late Medellin cartel kingpin, to unleash a savage war against the state and forced a constitutional ban on extradition in 1991.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Throngs of people flocked on Wednesday to a trade fare unveiling the latest personal security gadgets in a country where kidnapping and drug gangs are rampant.
The entry fee for the two-day Expo Seguridad fair was $285. But there was no shortage of takers in Colombia, which has the highest kidnap rate in the world, three guerrilla forces specialising in extortion and attacks on multinationals and drug gangs armed to the teeth.
Industrialists, government officials, defence experts and the worried wealthy were among those who descended on a downtown Bogota convention centre for the thrill of meeting shadowy people like an ex-spy from Israel offering the Sting-2, a $7 million dollar, remote-controlled plane able to start a one-man war or just monitor traffic.
Many hi-tech security gadgets like the Sting-2 are so secret that they are only be sold to hand-picked clients.
William Silva, a saleman with A1A Security, a Colombian firm headquartered in Miami, was offering a $600 wristwatch that is really a camera, or a video camera so small that it can be concealed in the end of a neck tie.
""My speciality is espionage and counter-espionage. I have given advice and provided equipment for the Colombian army and the security services,"" Silva said. ""I look on myself as a Colombian James Bond or a character from Mission Impossible.""
Another popular service for those with a bunker mentality is armour-plating. The price tag for fitting a Range Rover with sophisticated alloys, tough enough to resist a bazooka, missile or bomb attack, was around $150,000.
""Colombia is certainly the market leader in Latin America and probably in the world for sales of armour-plated vehicles. There's such a huge problem of terrorism against the government and of kidnap by the guerrilla,"" Silva said.
For those more interested in surrounding themselves with a human shield rather than a ring of steel, Luis Enrique La Rotta, director of Sicurex, boasted he can provide bodyguards trained in methods learned from the Chinese, Incas and Aztecs.
""Becoming a bodyguard is like entering a religion. Once you're in you must keep practicing the faith,"" he said. ""We don't want Rambos, our escorts are intelligent, intuitive and astute. They smell danger but don't look for a fight. They only use guns as a last resort.""
The Israeli connection at the fair is strong. One company is offering two-week training sessions in the Middle East. Another specialist Benny Manel, a former adviser to the Israeli government, gives a conference on industrial espionage and sabotage.
"
KarlPenhaul,"Horacio Serpa, Colombia's Interior Minister and the strongman of President Ernesto Samper's administration, resigned on Tuesday to prepare his bid for the presidency.
In accepting Serpa's public letter of resignation, Samper wished his right-hand man ""every success in your new activities"" in a laudatory reply made available to the media.
""Long ago, I took the commitment to serve the country in public office and I wish to continue that task ... I present my resignation from my current post,"" Serpa said in his letter to Samper that revealed the pair's close political and personal friendship.
The move comes less than a week before the May 31 deadline by which prospective candidates must step down from public office if they wish to run in the May 1998 elections to choose Samper's successor.
Serpa, 53, a ruling Liberal Party member, has been at the helm of the Interior Ministry since Samper took office in August 1994. An able politician and fiery public speaker, Serpa earned himself a reputation as the president's staunchest ally, defending him against accusations that he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money from the infamous Cali cartel.
Samper was cleared of wrongdoing in a congressional inquiry last year. But Serpa, one of the campaign organisers, is still under investigation on suspicion of knowingly accepting illicit donations.
""These years have been a great and difficult experience. There has never been so much controversy or such acute confrontations,"" Serpa said in his letter, in reference to the drug-funding scandal that has dogged most of Samper's rule.
In addition to rounding on Samper's opponents at home, Serpa launched outspoken attacks against the president's fiercest international critic -- the United States.
He recently dubbed U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette, a ""sick gringo"" for what he claimed was the envoy's constant meddling in Colombia's internal affairs, especially those relating to anti-drug policy.
In the letter accepting his minister's resignation, Samper wrote: ""In these times devoid of values and ideals, your brave attitudes against violence, corruption ... or in defence of sovereignty are refreshing examples of a clean career.""
Recent opinions polls show Serpa lagging behind the former Chief Prosecutor turned presidential candidate Alfonso Valdivieso, a thorn in the side of Samper's administration for his pursuit of political corruption.
But Valdivieso, also a Liberal, shunned his party's backing and announced that he would run as an independent. Serpa, meanwhile, is likely to be able to count on the full political and financial support of the well-greased party machinery, which political analysts believe will greatly strengthen his hand as the presidential campaign gets into full swing.
"
KarlPenhaul,"The promised release of 70 captured troops this weekend could be the first step to ending Latin America's longest guerrilla insurgency -- or the start of an all-out war -- political analysts say.
Sixty soldiers have been held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for more than nine months in the jungle of southern Colombia, along with 10 marines captured in combat in January. They are scheduled to be released on Sunday in the town of Cartagena del Chaira at the heart of a 5,000 square mile (13,000 sq km) demilitarized zone in Caqueta province.
President Ernesto Samper, ignoring hawks in the military who want tough action against the rebels, bowed to the FARC's demands and ordered 5,000 troops to pull out of the area for 32 days. The accord on releasing the troops has the rebels and the government talking for the first time in six years and could jumpstart broader peace talks, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Colombia said.
""This is the first time that government and guerrilla representatives have sat down face to face since 1991. They didn't talk about peace but the fact they've sat down at the same table is very positive,"" ICRC official Pierre Gassmann told Reuters on Thursday.
But other analysts say the army is thirsty for revenge against the FARC, a Cuban-inspired rural guerrilla force that took up arms against the state in 1964.
Capturing the troops was the most important political and military victory the FARC has had in many years, Eduardo Pizarro, a political violence expert at Bogota's National University, said. ""This defeat forced the army to carry out a deep self-examination and in the coming months the conflict will become much more bitter; the army has been humiliated.""
The FARC forced the government to order the military out of a huge swathe of Caqueta, the first time the army has ceded so much to the rebels. But government officials say the release of the troops is a victory for democracy and peace.
The 60 soldiers were captured and 27 of their colleagues were killed when the FARC overran an army base at Las Delicias in southern Putumayo province last Aug. 30. The marines were captured in a separate fight in northwest Choco province.
The FARC commander who led the attack on the Las Delicias base, Joaquin Gomez, will preside over the handover ceremony on Sunday. Gomez, magnamimous in victory, told reporters: ""We cannot speak of victors and the vanquished. But the whole world has at last realised the magnitude of this conflict.""
Army commander Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett has hidden his anger at having to cede territory, albeit temporarily, calling it a ""political not a military decision."" But Pizarro believes Bonett will fight hard to dent the FARC's mushrooming military ego when the demilitarization accord ends on June 23.
Other experts agree Colombia's guerrilla war will drag on.
""These soldiers are the forgotten ones that nobody outside Colombia remembers,"" said Eduardo Gamarra, an academic at Florida International University. ""This is just another episode in a long war.""

KeithWeir,"Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier Plc said on Wednesday that currency factors were likely to depress this year's earnings after the company recorded an 11 percent profit rise in 1996.
Reed Elsevier co-chairman Nigel Stapleton told Reuters the strength of sterling would, if maintained, ""drag down"" headline earnings by five percent this year. Earnings figures for the combined businesses of Reed Elsevier are expressed in sterling.
Pre-tax profits in 1996 rose to 805 million pounds ($1.3 billion) from 723 million on turnover from continuing operations up to 3.38 billion pounds from 3.21 billion. Share analysts had forecast profits of between 808 and 821 million pounds.
Analysts said that the strong pound was likely to restrict earnings growth to single figures this year and they mentioned a likely profit figure of around 870 million pounds.
Reed International Plc, the British arm of the business, proposed a two-for-one share split to take effect in May.
London-listed Reed shares were down 18-1/2 pence to 1,155p at 1520 GMT, while Elsevier NV shares in Amsterdam dipped 1.10 guilders to 31.40.
Analysts said the company's performance had fallen slightly short of expectations and that Reed shares had risen more than 10 percent over the last two months on bid speculation.
For shareholders in Reed the full-year dividend was raised by 11 percent to 27.2 pence per share. Elsevier shareholders will receive 0.76 guilders per share, a 29 percent increase.
The company noted that currency conversions meant that Elsevier results and dividends were helped in guilder terms.
""It's good news for Elsevier and bad for Reed,"" said co-chairman Stapleton. ""(But) the two share prices are linked so much that Elsevier should pull Reed up with it in some respects.""
Stapleton said the 1996 figures reflected a ""solid performance"" right across the group. They followed a four percent earnings dilution resulting from the company's 1995 consumer business divestment programme.
Reed Elsevier sold consumer businesses, such as local newspapers, in order to focus on the provision of information in fields like science, business and the legal profession.
Stapleton said a ""big deal"" such as Reed's $1.5 billion purchase of U.S. on-line information supplier LEXIS-NEXIS in 1994 would be ""nice but not necessary"".
His co-chairman Herman Bruggink told analysts in Amsterdam that Lexis-Nexis was stepping up its efforts to expand outside its U.S. base and targeting Europe in particular.
Reed International said its proposed share split would be put to the vote at its annual general meeting in April, to take effect the following month.
It gave no reason for the split, but companies often opt to split their stock in the belief that the process makes their shares more liquid or tradeable. ($ = 0.629 British Pounds)

KeithWeir,"British newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc said on Thursday its 1996 profit rose six percent to a record level and that it was ploughing savings from lower newsprint costs back into its titles.
""We are trying to enhance our papers rather than cutting the cover price,"" chief executive David Montgomery said in a telephone interview.
""All the main newspaper groups are heavily subsidising cover prices in one way or another at the moment...We do not think this is the way to build a business,"" he added.
A newspaper price war has been fought in Britain since 1993, Rupert Murdoch's News International newspapers leading the way with price cuts and special promotions.
Montgomery said that the price of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed -- had fallen some 20 percent from 1996 highs. The Mirror's newsprint bill last year came to more than 130 million pounds ($210 million).
The group's flagship Mirror newspaper is Britain's second-top selling tabloid, behind News International's Sun.
Mirror's 1996 pre-tax profit rose 6.6 percent to 82.2 million pounds, before exceptional items. Total dividend was increased by 12.5 percent to 4.5p per share.
Mirror Group shares came off 5.5p to 211p by 1115 GMT in a generally lower London market.
""The group is in a good financial position to make prudent investments for the future and to continue its strategy of creating a more broadly based media group,"" the company said.
Mirror Group has interests in cable television and a stake of around 20 percent in Scottish Television Plc, the commercial terrestrial (ITV) broadcaster to central Scotland.
Losses from the developing Live TV cable channel fell from 10 million to around eight million pounds in 1996.
Mirror Group has a 46 percent stake in Newspaper Publishing, the company which produces the Independent and Independent on Sunday broadsheets and Montogomery said there were no plans to dispose of this.
The two newspapers reported circulation rises in February, the first signs that they may be pulling out of a sales slump.
Newspaper Publishing operating losses were 43 percent lower last year and Montgomery said that cost savings from combined operations meant the impact was ""negligible"" to Mirror Group.
The group said it had an exceptional gain of 19.4 million pounds in 1996, generated by the resolution of a number of property-related issues and the sale of STV's stake in fellow regional broadcaster HTV.
An exceptional tax credit of 9.1 million pounds was included in the 1996 accounts after a settlement was reached with the Inland Revenue on corporation tax payable for 1991-1994. Profit after tax increased to 83.1 million pounds, from 82.4 million pounds in 1995. ($1=.6228 Pound)

KeithWeir,"Investors in Britain's growing band of listed soccer clubs have recently experienced that sinking feeling all too familiar to long-suffering fans.
Shares prices have fallen faster than a relegation-bound team as the euphoria surrounding potential earnings from sources like pay-per-view television gives way to more sober analysis.
The sector has lost around 30 percent in the last six weeks or so, smaller clubs such as premier league strugglers Southampton and first division Sheffield United among the biggest losers.
However, even English champions Manchester United have seen their share price fall from a January high of 737p to its current level of 630p, this despite continuing success on the pitch at home and in Europe.
Share analysts who follow the financial fortunes of the clubs point out that these falls must be seen in the context of spectacular rises of 200 percent and more since early 1996.
Their view is that investors are backing a winner if they stick with the big clubs but that people should think twice before putting money into clubs outside of soccer's elite.
""We believe a derating of the smaller clubs is inevitable and could be marked. These are the footballing bubbles that will fade and die,"" UBS analysts Guy Feld and Julian Easthope wrote in a recent report on what they call ""UK Football Plc"".
""In England, Premier League status will be essential, and the cost of being outside it will increase, because of the increasing concentration of TV revenues at the top end of the game,"" they added.
Pay-per-view television is seen as a major benefit to only the creme de la creme of the British and European game.
UBS selected a top 10 UK soccer franchises, featuring listed clubs Manchester United, Leeds United, Glasgow Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur.
Two more of their tips, English premier league clubs Newcastle United and Aston Villa, will join the market shortly.
Analysts expect heavy interest in both those clubs, given their strong fan base and established position among the most successful teams in the country.
Analyst Nick Batram of Greig Middleton agrees that share prices of some of the smaller clubs could fall further.
But he believes that clubs can make money outside the premier league, providing they do not overstretch themselves.
""They have to look at being profitable in the lower divisions rather than gambling on getting in the Premier League,"" he said.
""Millwall is unfortunately a good example of what happens when you speculate on promotion,"" he said.
Second division Millwall were forced to call in the administrator in January after running up debts of 10 million pounds ($16 million).
The south London club had signed players on lucrative contracts in a bid to join the 20-club premier league elite but ran into financial problems when the club went down rather than up at the end of last season.

KeithWeir,"Shares in United News &amp; Media Plc climbed to record highs on Friday after the British television and newspaper group reported a 12 percent profit rise in the first year since a merger effectively doubled its size.
A media heavyweight was created last year when United News, publisher of national newspapers The Express and Daily Star, joined forces with commercial television and financial services group MAI in a three billion pound ($4.8 billion) deal.
The enlarged company said 1996 profit before tax and exceptional items rose 12 percent to 290.2 million pounds. Earnings per share increased 15 percent to 40 pence.
""I think we have delivered at the top end of expectations against the agenda we set ourselves at the time of the merger,"" chief executive Clive Hollick told Reuters.
Share analysts also gave Hollick and his team their seal of approval. United shares added 25.5p to 766p by 1600 GMT after earlier hitting a post-merger high of 769p.
Several analysts increased their forecasts for 1997 profits, which are seen in a range between 310 and 335 million pounds.
""The review of the businesses following the merger has been completed, with adjustments to the portfolio in some areas and changed operating strategies in others,"" said Hollick, who moved across from MAI.
United said savings as a result of the merger and subsequent restructuring were expected to reach 43 million pounds a year by 1998. It took an exceptional charge of 56 million pounds last year, mainly stemming from the merger.
The company has been active on the disposals and acquisitions front, spending more than 750 million pounds last year as it bought exhibitions group Blenheim and a 29.9 percent stake in regional television broadcaster HTV .
It recouped around 300 million by selling a finance company, a legal publisher and local newspaper interests.
United, which operates commercial television (ITV) franchises in southern and eastern England, said operating profit from its broadcasting and entertainment division rose by 36 percent to almost 60 million pounds.
Profit from the business services unit increased by 38 percent to 100.5 million but the contribution from financial services fell slightly to 51.1 million.
Earnings from consumer publishing dropped 7.5 percent to 81 million after a 31 million pound increase in paper costs.
Hollick said restructuring of the national newspapers should bring annual savings of 15 million pounds, some of which would be ploughed back into the titles.
The mid-market Daily and Sunday Express titles have been relaunched as a combined seven-day operation in a bid to end a long-term sales decline.
United said trading in early 1997 was ""well in line with expectations"". It is paying a final dividend of 15.5 pence per share, bringing the total for the year to 23.5 pence, an increase of two percent. ($1=.6228 Pound)

KeithWeir,"Pearson Plc's new chief executive Marjorie Scardino promised on Monday to improve the financial performance of the media and leisure group but said she would bring ""evolution not revolution"".
Pearson posted 1996 operating profit of 181.3 million pounds ($289 million) after a 100 million pound charge for improper accounting at its Penguin USA trade book publishing unit.
Leaving aside exceptional items, profit before tax rose seven percent to 251.8 million pounds. The total dividend was increased to 18 pence per share from 16.5p.
Scardino, a Texan who in January became the first woman to head a leading British company, noted that she had only been in the job 49 days and that she was in no position to unveil a ""new Pearson"" to assembled journalists. ""Decisions will be made speedily not hastily, it will be evolution not revolution around here,"" she said.
""Whatever else we do, we are going to work hard on improving the financial performance of the business,"" she said.
Scardino said Pearson, owner of the Financial Times newspaper, television production houses and Penguin books, had stellar assets but not all of them had performed well.
She said that underlying revenue growth of no better than six percent per annum over the past five years was ""clearly not very exciting"". Performance targets are to be better defined and incentive schemes for employees geared towards these.
She said ""there had not been enough joy and not enough sweat"" in the past among employees about the company's results.
Pearson shares fell 14p to 760p in a generally lower market. Share analysts said the Pearson presentation had been rather light on specific details.
They believe that Pearson will hold on to its television and Tussauds leisure interests despite speculation it would sell them. However, it may dispose of its holdings in the Lazard investment banking houses in London, New York and Paris.
Pearson also announced that it would invest up to 100 million pounds over the next five years in extending the Financial Times newspaper and brand internationally.
New print sites are to be established in Italy and Singapore but the main thrust of the expansion will focus on the United States. Financial Times editor Richard Lambert will be moving to New York for a year to oversee the editorial development.
Finance Director John Makinson said that he did not expect Pearson to increase the 100 million pound provision to cover the problems at Penguin USA, which date back to 1991.
The problem comes from unauthorised discounts given to customers in return for early payments and have been blamed on ""one rogue employee"".
""We are comfortable with that provision,"" Makinson told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""The 100 million pounds is to cover all known and foreseen eventualities,"" he added. ($1=.6281 Pound)
"
KeithWeir,"John Major's Conservatives can no longer rely on the loyal support of much of Britain's press to help deliver the votes needed to secure a fifth successive election victory, editors and political analysts say.
""It's the Sun wot won it,"" Rupert Murdoch's top-selling tabloid trumpeted after Major's ruling party defied the opinion polls and secured a slim 21-seat majority in 1992.
Traditionally pro-Conservative newspapers, some 70 percent of Britain's press, threw their full weight behind Major five years ago, rubbishing opposition leader Neil Kinnock at every turn and warning voters not to trust Labour's promises.
""If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights,"" was the Sun's election day message, illustrated with a front-page picture of the Labour leader's head framed in a lightbulb.
But media watchers believe that Major is unlikely to enjoy such unequivocal support against Labour's Tony Blair in an election which the prime minister announced on Monday would be held on May 1. Labour has a big lead in opinion polls.
""It won't be possible for the Sun to be as enthusiastic about Major and negative about Blair as they were about Major and Kinnock last time around,"" said Ian Hargreaves, former editor of the Independent newspaper.
""They have poured so much crap on Major's head that it wouldn't be possible to back him enthusiastically and retain credibility with their readers,"" added Hargreaves, who now edits the left-leaning New Statesman magazine.
Kinnock was portrayed as volatile and untrustworthy by much of the press in the last campaign. Blair is a media-savvy moderate who has taken his party to the centre ground since becoming leader in July 1994 and is a harder target to attack.
Major's battle to keep his party together over future relations with the European Union has reduced his standing among the pro-Conservative newspapers, many of which demandi a stronger anti-European line.
""It would be inconceivable and a mistake for the Sun not to deliver its vote but it might not be done with the rasping clarity we have come to know and love,"" Hargreaves added.
""I would expect the Sun to be pro-Tory but I think the tone may be that of a 'plague on both your houses'. I think that might be something you see in quite a bit of the press.""
POLITICAL BIAS
British newspapers wear their political sympathies on their sleeves, not only writing trenchant editorials but also slanting their news coverage in a way that amazes many foreign readers.
The support is important as newspaper circulation remains high in Britain. The combined circulation of the national dailies has been in gradual decline but still tops 14 million each day.
Among the mass-market tabloids, the Daily Mirror and its Scottish sister the Daily Record were alone in backing Labour in 1992. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both stuck to their customary pro-Conservative line, as of course did the Sun.
Among the broadsheet ""quality"" press, Murdoch's Times and Canadian Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph both backed the government while the Guardian supported Labour and the Independent lived up to its name by remaining broadly neutral.
Most surprising of all was an election day editorial in favour of Labour from the Financial Times, the daily staple of business people.
Blair understands the power of the press and provoked controversy in 1995 when he accepted an invitation to address a conference organised by Murdoch's News Corp in Australia, the media magnate's homeland.
The Labour leader has dined with several newspaper proprietors and editors who have reacted with warm words to Blair. But Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell still believes he is ""dealing with a press that basically wants to do us in if it can"".
MURDOCH'S INFLUENCE
Murdoch's influence over the British press is hard to overstate, his News International arm controlling around 35 percent of the market through its ownership of the Sun, the Times and Sunday titles News of the World and Sunday Times.
""Labour are haunted by the Sun 'light-bulb' front page and are determined to avoid a repetition of that,"" said Andrew Jaspan, former editor of Britain's Observer newspaper, commenting on Blair's efforts to build bridges with Murdoch.
There has been speculation that some of the News International stable may come out and back Blair.
Campbell says the Sun and the Daily Mail, often called the voice of Middle England, are the most important papers for his party but he is cautious about the chances of their endorsement. ""I don't think even the most zealous right-wingers in those papers want to get back to where they were with Neil Kinnock,"" he said.
""Having said that, I've always said that if we could actually win the endorsement of a paper whose endorsement we didn't have at the last election, that would be a huge bonus."" The mid-market Express, known as a ""Conservative party cheer leader"", is one possibility. United News &amp; Media, the paper's parent company, is now controlled by Labour supporting peer Lord Hollick, nicknamed ""The Red Baron"".
ABILITY OF MEDIA TO SWING VOTES IN DOUBT
Despite the anecdotal evidence and the Sun's claims, there is some doubt about the extent to which newspapers are able to affect voting patterns although opinion polls show readers of the Telegraph, Times and Sun are increasingly turning to Labour.
""It does look as if the tabloids are able to swing people and the Sun seems better at doing this than the Mirror,"" said Bill Miller, politics professor at Glasgow University.
""Mirror readers are more likely to be politically committed whereas the majority of Sun readers are not political animals and more open to influence,"" he said.
But Miller, who has studied the effects of newspapers on voting, said the importance of the press can be overstated.
He notes that the Sun, for example, sells only four million copies in a nation of 35 million voters.
""There is a net influence -- perhaps a swing of one percent which last time would have made the difference between Major's majority and a hung parliament.""
But he said that this was not enough to affect the 15 to 20 percentage point lead which Labour holds in most opinion polls.
""If you want to annoy an incoming government you must expect to bear the consequences. It may be that the classic Tory tabloids realise this is not the election for them,"" he said.
"
KeithWeir,"Pearson Plc's new chief executive Marjorie Scardino, the first woman to head a major British company, vowed on Monday to improve the financial performance of the media and leisure group.
Pearson announced a 1996 operating profit of 281 million pounds ($451 million), a rise of eight percent, before taking a 100 million pound charge for improper accounting at its Penguin USA trade book publishing subsidiary.
Finance Director John Makinson said that he did not expect Pearson to have to increase the provision to cover the problems at Penguin USA, which date back to 1991.
""We are comfortable with that provision,"" Makinson told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""The 100 million pounds is to cover all known and foreseen eventualities,"" he added.
Makinson dismissed a report in the Sunday Times newspaper that the charge could double as a result of legal action by book retailers in the United States.
Pearson increased its full year dividend to 18p from 16.5p. The company's shares slipped 9p to 765p in early trading although the figures were broadly in line with market forecasts.
A great deal of market attention focused on the plans of Texan Scardino, who took the reins at Pearson in January.
She acknowledged that the company's profit performance must improve but gave few clues as to which parts of the business could be sacrificied in her drive for focus.
Among Pearson's assets are the Financial Times newspaper, a number of television production companies and a leisure arm which includes London's Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum.
""The major immediate changes under new management at Pearson will be the ones of style and focus on performance. As time goes on, we may change the business we're in too, as we work toward being first in a few important markets,"" Scardino said.
""But we won't be selling things just to be tidy. We'll be selling things where the move will make the company more valuable for our shareholders -- of today and tomorrow.""
The leisure operations and a 50 percent stake in London merchant bank Lazard Brothers have been seen as possible candidates for disposal.
Scardino said greater emphasis would be based on performance measures for the operating companies. She also said that running the company as an integrated media group would create considerable scope to increase revenues and reduce costs.
Pearson also announced that it would invest up to 100 million pounds over the next five years in extending the Financial Times newspaper and brand internationally.
New print sites are to be established in Italy and Singapore but the main thrust of the expansion will focus on the United States. Financial Times editor Richard Lambert will be moving to New York for a year to oversee the editorial development.
Pearson added that the group had made a satisfactory start to the current year with operating profits in line with expectations. ($1=.6228 Pound)

KeithWeir,"Shares in British publisher Dorling Kindersley Holdings Plc lost almost 20 percent of their value on Tuesday after the company warned that profits would fall short of last year's level.
Traders wiped over 40 million pounds ($64 million) off Dorling's value as the company warned tough conditions in the U.S. retail book market, currency movements and increased investment in its direct selling business would hit profits.
It restated its profits for the year to end-June 1996 to 12.9 million pounds ($20.5 million) from 17.4 million pounds to reflect a change in the way it accounts for multimedia development costs.
Managing director Rod Hare said profits would fall ""somewhat short"" of 12.9 million pounds but would not specify how much.
The warning, the second in little more than three months, sent Dorling shares spiralling 60p lower to 261p by 1025 GMT.
The value of the company has halved to around 180 million pounds since the company warned of the likely impact of sterling strength in early December.
Dorling reported a nine percent rise in pre-tax profit to 6.8 million pounds in the six months to December 31. Interim dividend was left unchanged at 1.5 pence per share.
""The primary factor for the downgrade in the profit forecast is...the U.S. book market has not performed as expected,"" managing director Hare told Reuters.
Hare said that Dorling had suffered from a change in policy at leading U.S. book retail chains Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, which had cleared out their stock and cut new orders after their store expansion programmes slowed.
Hare said that Dorling believed that a more normal re-order pattern would be restored later this year for back order books, However, he expects the U.S. chains to continue to order less initial stock of new titles.
Dorling earns more than 40 percent of revenue in dollars and Hare said that the strength of the pound would result in ""well over a million pounds of lost profit"" this year. ($1=.6281 Pound)

KeithWeir,"Newcastle United season ticket holders were rewarded for their loyalty on Monday when the English premier league club said only those regular fans would be able to buy shares in a flotation.
Initial interest in the listing appeared to confound the sceptics who suggested that the London stock market's enthusiasm for soccer stocks was waning.
The prices of listed clubs have fallen heavily in recent weeks. First division Charlton Athletic is trading at a heavy discount to its offer price after joining the junior Alternative Investment Market on Friday.
Share analysts said that Newcastle's status as one of the elite of English soccer and a squad boasting talent such as England captain Alan Shearer was bound to tempt investors.
Each Newcastle season ticket holder who has applied for stock will be allocated 370 shares, an investment of 500 pounds ($805), when the club joins the stock market next week.
Newcastle made 15 percent of the placing available to individuals, the remainder going to large institutions. The level of demand meant that ordinary members of the public who are not season ticket holders missed out completely.
The offer price has been set at 135p, capitalising Newcastle at 193 million pounds and making it the third largest English soccer stock after Manchester United and Chelsea.
Former European champions Aston Villa, one place below Newcastle at fifth in the premier league, moved a step closer to the market on Monday when shareholders approved flotation plans.
The Birmingham-based club is aiming to raise 15-20 million pounds in a flotation valuing at in excess of 120 million. The flotation is expected before the soccer season ends in May.
Leicester City, a newly promoted premier league team who have reached this year's League Cup final, are also reported to be considering a flotation.
Soccer club owners have recently cashed in on the game's popularity by joining the stock market. The move allows clubs to raise finance to fund stadium redevelopment and enables directors to spread ownership more widely and see a return on their own investment. ($1=.6215 Pound)

KeithWeir,"Britons resigned to spending Easter at home in front of the television will at least have extra entertainment this year with the new Channel 5 station which goes on air on Sunday night.
The station is the first commercial terrestrial channel to launch in Britain since Channel 4 (C4) in 1982. But C4 has a remit to cater for minority tastes while Channel 5 will go head to head against the powerful ITV commercial network of regional broadcasters.
""Channel 5's audience will grow as ITV's declines,"" Dawn Airey, Channel 5 Director of Programmes, said last month. She promised ""intelligent, stylish and popular"" shows from a channel hoping to attract advertisers seeking to target young consumers.
Channel 5 is aiming to fill in the areas its terrestrial signal cannot reach by securing carriage agreements with BSkyB, and the cable companies.
Satellite and cable subscription channels have multiplied in Britain in recent years but only around 25 percent of households take them, limiting their appeal to advertisers.
Britons are television addicts, spending an average of almost four hours in front of the set every day. But will they find anything they want to watch on the new channel?
Operating on a limited budget, the station has set itself apparently modest initial viewing targets.
Its chief executive David Elstein, who was hired from pay television giant BSkyB, has said he believes the channel can win a five percent audience share by the end of the year. ITV, by contrast, has a share of around 35 percent.
However, Channel 5's core programme budget is only 110 million pounds ($175 million), against 600 million for ITV.
The licence-funded BBC, which supplies the other two ""free to air"" UK channels, spent a total of 1.1 billion pounds on its television operations in 1995/96.
Channel 5, owned by British media groups Pearson Plc, United News &amp; Media, European broadcaster CLT-Ufa and U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus, has already had its share of problems before going on air.
Its major headache was the need to retune millions of video recorders in homes up and down the nation to avoid interference from its signal. That exercise has cost an estimated 150 million pounds, three times the original forecasts.
Channel 5 delayed its start date from January after the allocation of an extra broadcast frequency increased the workload on its army of retuners.
Little more than 60 percent of Britons are likely to be able to receive the service when it goes on air on Sunday. But this figure should increase to around 85 percent of the population by the end of the year as the extra frequency comes into use.
However, as many as two million of the 18 million homes reached could require a new or upgraded television aerial in order to get a decent picture.
Channel 5 plans a daily soap at 6.30 p.m. and its main evening news will be at 8 p.m., to avoid competing with the bulletins on BBC 1 and ITV.
That early news bulletin clears the decks for a daily feature film in the 9 p.m. slot. Extra money has been added to the core programming budget to secure movie deals and films lined up include Speed, Mrs Doubtfire and Independence Day.
The channel has also secured the rights to the Poland-England World Cup soccer match on May 31.
The consensus in the industry is that Channel 5 is likely to establish itself once the teething troubles are overcome. Its prospects are enhanced by the fact that it is getting into the market before multi-channel digital TV becomes a reality.
""It has got a whole set of problems such as retuning and coverage and it is entering what is now a much more competitive market,"" said Kip Meek, of media and telecommunications industry advisers Spectrum Strategy Consultants.
""But it is a new terrestrial channel and as such it should be able to make money.""

KeithWeir,"British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc defied a steep rise in newsprint costs to post a small profit increase on Wednesday.
Pre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39 million pounds ($60.6 million). This came despite an increase of 18 million pounds in the cost of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed.
""Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,"" chief executive David Montgomery said.
""The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,"" he added.
Exceptional credits of 12.9 million pounds were realised, principally from the settlement of property related issues.
Interim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p.
Market reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding 5.5p to 207p by 1210 GMT after earlier hitting 210p.
Mirror Group's flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain's second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.
Finance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.
The group forecast that the price per tonne of newsprint should decline to 475 pounds in the second half of the year from 520 pounds in the first six months.
It said its annual newsprint bill could climb as high as 131 million pounds in 1996, an increase of 20 million pounds, and noted that the pricing trend remained uncertain. The Mirror's Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service.
Live TV's offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but the company said it was an under-valued asset.
It said that a recent independent assessment had valued the company at up to 90 million pounds and added there were no plans to dispose of it.
Live TV is connected to 1.45 million households -- 94 percent of all UK cable homes. It has special local affiliates in central London and Birmingham with plans to add the cities of Liverpool and Edinburgh by the end of the year. ($1=.6430 Pound)

KeithWeir,"British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc posted a small profit increase on Wednesday in the face of a large jump in newsprint costs.
Pre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39.0 million pounds ($60.59 million).
Interim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p.
Initial market reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding seven to 208.5p by 0845 GMT.
""Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,"" chief executive David Montgomery said in a statement.
""The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,"" Montgomery added.
Mirror Group's flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain's second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.
The costs of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed -- rose by 18 million pounds year-on-year but Mirror said it had largely managed to off-set this through higher advertising and circulation revenues.
Finance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.
With newsprint price now levelling off, Allwood said that the company would now seek to win new readers with special supplements to its core titles.
The Mirror's Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service.
Live TV's offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but Allwood said this was undeserved.
""It is now receivable in 1.45 million homes and I think people should stop knocking us and give us a bit more credit,"" he said, adding 60-70 main brand companies advertised on Live.
The channel is currently available in central London and Birmingham but launches are planned in the cities of Liverpool and Edinburgh by the end of the year.

KeithWeir,"Channel 5, Britain's new commercial television station, said on Monday it was delighted with its launch after initial figures showed that five of its first night shows attracted a million viewers or more.
An estimated 2.3 million Britons tuned in when the station was launched on Sunday by chart-topping band The Spice Girls.
""We are delighted by the figures given that the weather was so good and some people are still tuning in their sets to pick us up,"" said Channel 5 spokeswoman Sally Osman.
Initial figures from the BARB monitoring service give Channel 5 a 5.8 percent share of viewing in the 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. slot.
The channel, the first commercial terrestrial station to launch in Britain since 1982, has a limited budget and has set itself a target for an audience share of five percent by the end of the year. It has styled itself ""modern and mainstream"" and is focusing particularly on the under-35s.
ITV, the dominant commercial television network, hit back by pointing out that its long-running Coronation Street soap had 11.6 million viewers for its Sunday evening episode. It said it had retained its traditional dominance of the ratings.
Channel 5 has transmission problems to overcome and is so far available in only six out of 10 British households.
It hopes to boost coverage to around 85 percent of the UK by the end of the year after an extra broadcast frequency comes on stream. It aims to fill in the gaps through carriage agreements with cable and satellite companies.
It was given a guarded welcome by the British press. ""Although the station's news output should be distinctive the mix of soaps, imports, comedy and films is close to what is already on offer elsewhere,"" the Times wrote in an editorial.
But the newspaper said that the channel's low budget need not result in low quality.
""There are obvious opportunities for savings in modern programme making. If that space is creatively exploited by Channel 5 then it should be able to secure for itself a deserved place on the nation's screens,"" it added.
Channel 5 is owned by British media companies Pearson and United News &amp; Media, plus European broadcast group CLT-Ufa and U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus.
It is the third commercial terrestrial channel after the ITV network and Channel 4. The two BBC channels are funded by an annual licence fee levy. The newcomer also faces competition from some 40 or so cable and satellite channels, to which around 25 percent of British households subscribe.
Channel 4 has a remit to cater for minority tastes so Channel 5 will compete directly with ITV for the mainstream terrestrial audience.
ITV has an average audience share of around 35 percent and its annual programming budget of 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) far outweighs the 110 million pounds which Channel 5 plans to spend.

KeithWeir,"Shares in Newcastle United Plc scored a premium to their flotation price on Wednesday when the Premier League soccer club became the latest team to join the London Stock Exchange.
Newcastle, floated at 135p, had added 6p to 141p by 1145GMT in heavy trading.
The club, based in northeast England and home to stars such as England captain Alan Shearer, Frenchman David Ginola and Colombian Faustino Asprilla, has a market capitalisation of just over 200 million pounds ($330 million).
Soccer club stocks rocketed in value last year but there has been a sharp correction in recent weeks, with the lesser lights of the Premier League and First Division clubs hit hardest.
Euphoria over potential income from pay-per-view television has evaporated, and the increasing supply of soccer club stocks has allowed investors to pick and choose more carefully.
However, clubs are still queueing up to join the market. Bolton Wanderers, poised for promotion to the Premier League, will be floated later this month following a 22 million pound agreed takeover by a company called Mosaic Investments.
Mosaic, which manufactures bar and catering products, is to rename the enlarged group Burnden Leisure Plc and plans to develop it into a sports and leisure business. The name is taken from Bolton's Burnden Park stadium.
Share analysts had expected the Newcastle flotation to prove popular as it gives investors access to one of the glamour clubs of the English game.
Only season ticket holders and club employees were allocated shares after the 15 percent retail tranche in the offer was heavily oversubscribed. The remainder was taken up by institutional investors.
Share analysts believe that Newcastle is well placed to benefit from soccer's financial growth. But they note that it still has work to do before it can claim to be on a par with the elite trio of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Of those three, only United are listed on the main market.
""Newcastle have great ingredients with strong local support, a developing brand and a reputation for the kind of exciting soccer which attracts television audiences,"" said analyst Nick Batram of Greig, Middleton.
""The next stage is to turn that into profits and for a lot of people the jury is still out -- they want to see the company deliver.""
Newcastle have spent 50 million pounds on players over the past five years, bankrolled by millionaire property developer Sir John Hall. Hall remains chairman of the football club but has not joined the board of the parent company where his son Douglas holds a controlling stake.
The investment has transformed the club from an ailing first division team into a Premier League force, although a major trophy has so far proved elusive.
Those transfer costs mean Newcastle has reported an operating loss in each of the past five years, although it was profitable in the six months to January of this year.
Bolton, in north-west England, were one of the 12 founders of the English Football League over a century ago.
They have languished in the lower divisions of English soccer for much of the past 20 years but believe that promotion to the Premier League and a move to a new 25,000-capacity stadium give them a sound basis for the future.

KeithWeir,"British television and newspaper group United News &amp; Media posted a profit rise of more than 20 percent on Thursday and said it had made significant progress since a merger earlier this year effectively doubled its size.
Pre-tax profit before exceptional items from the group totalled 151.9 million pounds ($236.2 million) in the six months to June 30, against last year's restated figure of 125 million.
Market reaction to the figures was broadly favourable, United shares closing 5p higher at 710.5p.
The figures were the first since a merger between United News &amp; Media and television and financial services group MAI. The merger, completed in April, created a company with a market capitalisation of more than three billion pounds.
The group owns British national newspapers The Daily and Sunday Express and Daily Star and operates commercial television (ITV) franchises in southern and eastern England.
Share analysts said that extensive restructuring meant that most of the merger benefits would not feed through until next year and some complained that the results were unnecessarily hard to decipher.
""There are huge exceptional items and I think the progress will come next year but the jury is still out,"" said one, reflecting a general sentiment. ""They're spending a 100 million pounds to reshape the business and it will be a long payback.""
Chief executive Lord Hollick said that a review of the group's businesses would be completed by the end of the year.
""This year's accounts will tell the full story,"" he said.
Reviewing the merger, chairman Lord Stevens said in a statement: ""One-off costs will be significant and to date amount to 56.4 million pounds"".
United will take an 82 million pound profit on the sale of specialist legal publisher Tolley in its full year figures. It is also seeking buyers for some 50 local newspapers in southern England and Wales, a sale that could raise 50 million pounds.
On the debit side, it will take a charge in the second half of 32 million pounds for the reorganisation of Express newspapers. It also faces costs of up to 30 million pounds from its share in Britain's new Channel 5 television station.
The merger spawned an unlikely management team of Stevens and Hollick, dubbed ""The Odd Couple"" by the British press.
Hollick, formerly MAI's managing director, is a staunch supporter of the opposition Labour Party, while Stevens' Express newspapers reflect his backing for the ruling Conservatives.
United last week announced a plan to put the Daily and Sunday Express titles under a seven-day editorial team in an attempt to halt a long-term decline.
Hollick said the newspapers had been ""starved of investment"" and vowed to plough 10 million pounds back into Express annually in each of the next three years. ($1=.6430 Pound)

""This has been a period of significant progress. We achieved an increase in profits of over 20 percent, and the strategy outlined at the time of the merger is being implemented effectively,"" said chairman Lord Stevens.
""There will be further initiatives in the second half to improve our operating performance and to strengthen and develop our products and franchises,"" he added.
The merger between United News &amp; Media and television and financial services group MAI, completed in April, created a major media company with a market capitalisation of over three billion pounds.
The enlarged group owns British national newspapers The Daily and Sunday Express and Daily Star and operates commercial television (ITV) franchises in southern and eastern England.
The merger spawned a management team of Lord Stevens and MAI's Lord Hollick, a duo dubbed ""The Odd Couple"" by the British press.
Hollick, now United News chief executive, is a staunch supporter of the opposition Labour party while Stevens' Express newspapers reflect his backing for the ruling Conservatives.
Hollick told Reuters on Thursday that United News aimed to complete a review of its portfolio of businesses by the end of the year. ""We have set a fairly fast pace,"" Hollick said of the first few months of life with United.
Hollick noted that the performance was ""at the top end of expectations"" but market reaction to the figures was cautious.
United shares added 9.5p to 715p in early business but gradually retreated to stand only 1p firmer at 706.5p.
The large number of exceptional items stemming from the company's reorganisation prompted the caution. Turnover was moderate as many traders sat things out while their media analysts discussed the figures with the company.
Reviewing the merger, chairman Lord Stevens said: ""One-off costs will be significant and to date amount to 56.4 million pounds"".
United will include an 82 million pound profit on the sale of specialist legal publisher Tolley in its full year figures. It will also take a charge in the second half of 32 million pounds stemming from the reorganisation of Express newspapers.
The Daily and Sunday Express titles are to be produced by a single editorial team, the first genuine experiment with a seven-day-a-week operation in the British national press.
Hollick said that the newspapers will be given time to close the circulation gap on mid-market rival The Daily Mail. The once-mighty Express sells some 1.2 million copies while The Mail has circulation of above two million all through the week. ($=0.6430 Pound)

KeithWeir,"The UK government on Monday threatened to scupper a bid by London Clubs International for rival casino group Capital Corp when they passed it to competition authorities.
Consumer Affairs Minister John Taylor said the 190 million pound ($310 million) hostile bid raised competition concerns in relation to the London casinos market. He referred it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
London Clubs, which operates seven casinos in the British capital, said it was disappointed by the decision.
""We believe that the arguments which we submitted to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) provided sound evidence that there were no adverse competition issues,"" said London Clubs chief executive Alan Goodenough.
The MMC has until July 7 to decide on the issue. The referral means the bid automatically lapses.
London Clubs said its board would meet to consider future action. It could come up with a fresh bid if the MMC clears the proposed acquisition of Capital, which operates Crockfords and the Colony Club for high rollers in the swish Mayfair area of London.
A merged company would have controlled almost two-thirds of London's 1.7 billion pound casino market.
Shares in Capital Corp fell 15.5p to 184.5p after the bid was scrapped. They had stood at 171p on February 14, the day before the bid was tabled. London Clubs came off 6.5p to 402p, having risen from 385p during the bid process.
London Clubs had been offering 47 of its shares for every 100 in Capital Corp in its all-paper offer. Share analysts had forecast a sweetened offer from London Clubs.
Capital Corp chief executive Alan Hearn welcomed the MMC referral, repeating that the bid was too low.
""The referral enables us to focus on developing further the group's valuable business, without the distraction and expense of a hostile bid,"" he said. ""I welcome the opportunity to demonstrate to shareholders the significant value we can create as an independent company.""
Hotel and gaming company Ladbroke Group Plc, which has four London casinos, had been mentioned as a possible rival bidder for Capital Corp. There had also been speculation that leading British leisure company Rank Group Plc, which has 31 casinos, could enter the fray.
British casinos are increasingly attractive investments as the government relaxes rules on membership and drinking hours. There are also proposals to allow new clubs to open at some 20 sites.($ = 0.611 British Pounds)

KevinDrawbaugh,"BBI Healthcare Corp, the company to be formed by the merger of Bergen Brunswig Corp and Ivax Corp, will target earnings growth of 15 percent or more and return on equity of 15 percent or better, said Bergen chief financial officer Neil Dimick.
""At a minimum, our objective would be to grow earnings at greater than 15 percent,"" Dimick said at an investors conference here Tuesday held by the Raymond James brokerage and investment bank.  
The Bergen-Ivax merger is proceeding as planned, said Bergen chief executive Donald Roden.
Orange, Calif.-based Bergen is the largest U.S. distributor of generic drugs, while Miami-based Ivax is a generic drug manufacturing giant.
The two agreed in November to a stock-for-stock merger in which Ivax shareholders will get 0.42 shares of BBI for each Ivax share, and Bergen shareholders will get one share of BBI for each Bergen share. After the merger, BBI will be about 56 percent owned by Ivax shareholders and the remainder by Bergen shareholders, the companies said.  
Roden will be BBI chief executive. Ivax chief executive Phillip Frost and Bergen chief executive Robert Martini will be co-chairmen of BBI, while Dimick will be BBI chief financial officer, the companies said.
BBI will be a vertically integrated company handling generic drugs and other healthcare products from the research lab, through production and distribution, the companies said.
Bergen also announced Tuesday that it has developed an electronic, on-line catalog and historical purchasing database service for generic drugs and healthcare products. ""Catalog users will have instant access to more than 300,000 products offered by any and all of our subsidiaries,"" Roden said.
The on-line service will make purchasing data going back 24 months available via computer, Bergen said.
The electronic catalog is scheduled to be delivered to customers in June, Bergen said.

KevinDrawbaugh,"Biogen Inc expects to begin European marketing of Avonex, a multiple sclerosis drug, within the next 30 days and expects European sales eventually to match U.S. sales, President and Chief Operating Officer James Tobin said Wednesday.
At a Raymond James investors conference here, Tobin said, ""I would expect we'll be on the European market within the next 30 days ... Ultimately, I would expect that our sales in Europe would approach our level of sales in the U.S.""  
Avonex sales in 1996 totalled $76.5 million. Biogen's total 1996 sales were $277 million, up from $151.7 million in 1995. Biogen launched U.S. sales of Avonex -- the biotechnology pioneer's first major proprietary product -- in May 1996. Its sales have greatly boosted the company's revenue stream, previously comprised chiefly of royalties for hepatitis B vaccines and alpha interferon patents licensed to large pharmaceutical companies.  
Avonex reduces the frequency and severity of multiple sclerosis flares and competes with Schering AG's Betaseron, as well as the recently approved Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.
Biogen plans to expand revenues and earnings by selling more Avonex and getting it approved for uses other than multiple sclerosis, in addition to out-licensing other technologies, Tobin said.
Biogen hopes to soon out-license Hirulog, a blood-thinning agent. ""We have found someone who is interested,"" Tobin said.
The company also has new possible products in the pipeline, including a renal disorder treatment called OP-1, which is being developed jointly with Creative BioMolecules Inc , as well as other compounds.
""The point is that Biogen is not a one-drug story,"" Tobin said.

KevinDrawbaugh,"Pier 1 Imports is targeting earnings growth this year near the high end of its annual objective of 15 to 18 percent over the life of a five-year business plan, Chief Executive Clark Johnson said Wednesday.
""The Street has got us up toward the higher end of that range and I think we have an internal goal to do better than that, but that's an internal goal and it's not a forecast,"" Johnson told Reuters in an interview after a presentation to investors at a Raymond James conference here.  
Raymond James projects the retailer will report fiscal 1997 earnings of $1.25 per share, up 19 percent from $1.05 for fiscal 1996 ended February 28.
Johnson said Pier 1 projects sales this year will rise about $100 million. The company, which has 725 stores in North America plus joint ventures in England, Mexico and Japan, posted fiscal 1996 sales of $944.6 million.
He said the company will open 53 stores this year and close about 25. Remodeling and remerchandising of store layouts is also under way throughout much of the chain, reflecting a change in product lines, he said.  
At the end of its fiscal year last month, Pier 1 stopped selling apparel. It is beefing up its home furnishings offerings in response to what it sees as changing consumer attitudes. ""The Martha Stewart syndrome is alive and well in America,"" Johnson said.
""There's been a shift in consumer spending away from apparel, and even in this past holiday season away from consumer electronics and toward home furnishings,"" he said.
Pier 1 is also launching a bridal registry program that Johnson said is expected to take further advantage of the trend toward higher sales of furniture, fixtures and other items for the home.
The company operates a joint venture in England called ""The Pier."" Johnson said it is expected to break even this year after losing money last year.
He said expansion in Japan continues. ""We think it's possible to eventually have about 200 stores in Japan,"" he said.

KevinDrawbaugh,"In reply to a report issued last week by two Wall Street drug industry analysts, Eli Lilly and Co said it is unaware of physicians having problems switching schizophrenia patients from older treatments to Lilly's new antipsychotic drug, Zyprexa.
""We are not hearing anything from our prescribing physicians, sales representatives or clinical investigators that would indicate a problem upgrading patients to Zyprexa,"" said Lilly vice president Gary Tollefson. ""On the contrary, Zyprexa prescriptions, including refills, continue to grow.""  
Shares in the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturing giant closed down 2-1/2 to 86-5/8 Thursday, extending a week of choppy declines from a 52-week high of 95 on February 24.
Fahnestock &amp; Co analysts Louis Webb and Irena Djurovich issued a report February 26 that said physicians are having trouble switching patients to Zyprexa and that expectations for the drug's sales potential may be inflated.
A follow-up report on February 28, issued after the analysts talked with Lilly, said the Zyprexa switching problems persisted. Contacted Thursday, Webb said, ""We stand by our original report.""  
The February 26 report said, ""The Director of Ambulatory Services for Outpatient Psychiatry for Bellevue Hospital in New York City expressed to us that about a third of his patients that were switched to Zyprexa from Risperdal and other antipsychotics had experienced a return of psychotic symptoms."" Risperdal is a competing anti-schizophrenia drug made by New Jersey-based Johnson &amp; Johnson.
The March 3 Lilly rebuttal quoted Dr. David Nardacci, Director of Ambulatory Services for Outpatient Psychiatry at Bellevue, saying, ""As a practicing clinician, it is not customary for me to communicate with the analyst community.""  
He said, ""I was never told the results of my conversations were to be for publication. I take exception to the one-third figure italicized in the report and would like to state that for patients with prominent negative symptoms or severe EPS (extrapyramidal symptom) histories, Zyprexa should be considered alongside Risperdal as a first-line agent.""
Nardacci could not immediately be reached.
Zyprexa was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for U.S. sale in October, setting off a contest for market share between Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Abbott Laboratories Inc, Zeneca Group Plc and Pfizer Inc are expected to join the fray soon with new drugs.
Estimates of the size of the U.S. schizophrenia drug market vary widely, ranging from $1 billion to $4.5 billion, with about 2.5 million Americans suffering from the disorder.
Risperdal and Zyprexa, both fairly new, are already competing against older medications, including generically available haloperidol and Sandoz AG's Clozaril.

KevinDrawbaugh,"MGI Pharma Inc is reorienting its marketing efforts for Salagen, a drug for dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients, but it's still unable to predict when the company will turn a profit.
In an interview with Reuters, chief executive Charles Blitzer said Salagen is growing slowly. ""There's a lot we're learning about Salagen that we didn't understand back when it was being touted as a $100-million product,"" he said.
On the job since April, Blitzer said he is revamping the sales effort for the drug, which stimulates salivation.  
The Minnetonka, Minn.-based company has yet to post a sustainable profit. It lost $0.18 per share in 1995 and $0.82 per share in 1994. Dain Bosworth projects a loss of $0.34 per share this year and $0.15 per share in 1997.
""There's a question about whether we can be profitable in a sustained way in 1997,"" said chief financial officer James Adam.
The new strategy, bolstered by research data, encourages use of the drug during radiation treatments for head and neck cancer, rather than after treatment to relieve dry mouth, or xerostomia. A new sales force has been trained and fielded.  
""We're going to continue to make a steady and slow, but sure, impact in the head and neck cancer arena,"" Blitzer said.
Dain Bosworth last week lowered its estimate of the annual market for Salagen to $10-$12 million from $75 million. The firm cut its consolidated revenue estimate for MGI to $9.1 million for 1996 from $10.5 million, and to $12.4 million for 1997 from $22.4 million. Revenues were $13.3 million in 1995.
The company still expects to file a supplemental new drug application in the fourth quarter with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking clearance to sell Salagen as a treatment for Sjogren's Syndrome, Blitzer said.  
Sjogren's is an autoimmune disease that damages the salivary glands and most commonly affects post-menopausal women. The target population for the disorder numbers about 400,000 patients, compared to about 25,000 for xerostomia.
Data from completed clinical trials for Sjogren's may also indicate Salagen can relieve dry eye, or kerato conjunctivitis seca, with a target population of 10 million, Blitzer said. Salagen sales in the second quarter were $1.46 million, up 75 percent over the year-ago level.
Aside from Salagen, MGI continues to develop some anti-cancer compounds. Renewed attention was drawn to one, MGI 114, in July when the National Cancer Institute voted to fund a series of trials with it, he said.
MGI on Monday completed a secondary, 1.2 million-share stock offering that yielded proceeds of $5.6 million to be devoted to ""late-stage in-licensing opportunities"" of promising anti-cancer compounds, Blitzer said.
MGI shares were up 1/8 at 5-1/4 Tuesday. In mid-1994, they traded as high as 11.

KevinDrawbaugh,"Option Care Inc is comfortable with a Wall Street 1997 earnings estimate of $0.41 per share, compared to $0.33 per share before a one-time charge in 1996, said chief executive Erick Hanson.
In an interview with Reuters, Hanson said the Bannockburn, Ill.-based home healthcare company is targeting annual revenue growth of 25 to 30 percent. ""We have a pretty good pipeline and a plan to be able to achieve that,"" he said.
The company's thinly traded shares were unchanged at 5-5/8 late Wednesday. Management owns 70 percent of the stock.  
Started in California as a home infusion services franchiser, Option Care was bought in 1991 by healthcare entrepreneur and venture capitalist John Kapoor, who took it public the following year. Kapoor remains chairman and owns 60 percent of the company. Hanson came aboard two years ago.
Option Care and its franchisees operate 190 facilities in 39 states, with heavy concentrations in California, Georgia, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
Home healthcare firms sell services and products to people with cancer, AIDS and other medical disorders requiring intravenous drug treatment or other relatively complex care.  
As the managed care revolution has driven more patients out of expensive hospital beds, home healthcare has emerged as a hot industry. Nursing home companies, hospitals, HMOs and others are rushing to get into it, chiefly by acquiring home healthcare specialty firms such as Option Care.
Amidst this rapid consolidation, Option Care stands out as the largest remaining pure play in the market for home infusion therapy, or intravenous medication administration.
The company is diversifying into related home healthcare businesses, however, so that it will eventually resemble more broadly based home healthcare firms, Hanson said.  
Large, diversified competitors include Apria Healthcare Group Inc and Olsten Corp, Hanson said.
Option Care is going about its transition by acquiring its better home infusion franchises and smaller independent firms, as well as home nursing agencies, medical equipment sellers and respiratory therapy service providers. Option Care did 12 acquisitions in 1996 -- five franchises, seven independents.
""Our strategy is to buy strong franchises in targeted regions, then surround them with complementary services through acquisitions,"" Hanson said. ""Our objective is to be fully integrated by the end of 1999 in at least seven states.""  
""What we're saying is that with one phone call, one stop, we can provide any type of home care,"" Hanson said.
Option Care recently received a $30 million credit line from a group of banks. ""We're investigating during the next 12 to 18 months the possibility of putting more equity in play,"" Hanson said, adding that Kapoor is ""very much open to reducing his position, but he also doesn't want to walk away from it because he thinks it's a good place for his money.""

KevinDrawbaugh,"The boards of RightChoice Managed Care Inc and parent Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri are moving to calm relations with regulators, return to profitability and ensure company control is firmly in the hands of chief executive John O'Rourke.
The three-pronged strategy was highlighted Tuesday when the boards said talks about a possible combination of RightChoice and BJC Health Systems had been halted, putting an end to a project conceived and launched last year by two top executives who were fired on Wednesday.  
In an interview with Reuters, O'Rourke said the talks with BJC -- a St. Louis hospital organization -- were called off primarily for business reasons.
""It was clear as we proceeded in the discussion with BJC that the kind of deal that was being considered...would not be acceptable to the national Blue Cross association,"" he said.
But he added that the boards of RightChoice and the Missouri Blues meant to show their support for him as well.
""The other part of the decision was...a vote of confidence in the company and in the management team that had just been hired to direct the company,"" he said.  
RightChoice expects to return to profitability later this year.
""We're really projecting, at least at this point in time, that we will return to profitability by the third or fourth quarter,"" he said.
The St. Louis-based company lost $3.7 million on revenues of $170.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $4.9 million on revenues of $154.6 million a year earlier. Wall Street registered its disapproval of the announcement of the halted BJC talks by driving shares in RightChoice down 3-1/2 to close Tuesday at 13-3/8.  
On the day of the management shake-up, O'Rourke was in the office of Missouri Department of Insurance director Jay Angoff with an offer to make peace, he said.
In May 1996, the Missouri Blues sued Angoff seeking a declaratory judgment that all applicable laws had been followed in the 1994 restructuring creating RightChoice.
The Blues also sought a permanent injunction barring the department from taking certain actions against the company.
In August, the department blocked a proposed share transaction in which RightChoice would have purchased 1.5 to 2.0 million of its own shares from the Blues.  
Then on December 31, a Missouri judge ruled the Blues had ""abused or exceeded their legal authority"" in undertaking the reorganization that created RightChoice three years earlier.
Heimburger vowed to fight the court ruling. Meanwhile, under his watch, RightChoice lost money in its third and fourth fiscal quarters.
In February, O'Rourke was named chairman and chief executive of RightChoice, replacing Heimburger. O'Rourke had previously been president and chief executive of HealthLink Inc, which RightChoice acquired in 1995.
""I have a mandate from the board to...improve the profitability of the company, to improve the public image and to address our regulatory issues,"" O'Rourke said.
The Missouri Blues' appeal of the December 31 court ruling is still pending and the share transaction proposal remains on hold, O'Rourke said.

KevinDrawbaugh,"Troubled auto lender Mercury Finance Co. said Thursday it won an extension of its short-term credit line with Bank of America, but analysts said permanent refinancing remains Mercury's most critical need.
""The trick will be to get some permanent financing in place and then get the thing up and running again,"" said James Inglis, financial services analyst at Philo Smith &amp; Co.
Extension of the $50 million, short-term loan is still a major advance, said Mercury Chief Executive William Brandt.
Mercury's creditors granted waivers allowing extension of its credit line with Bank of America to June 10. The waivers permit Mercury to continue to pledge assets as collateral on the $50 million credit facility. The previous waiver period had been for only 30 days, Chicago-based Mercury said.
""This 90 day extension is a tangible demonstration of confidence in Mercury,"" Brandt said in a statement. ""The expanded waiver period gives the company breathing room to focus on operations and on the exploration of long-term financing alternatives.""
The company said it is talking with holders of $22 million of subordinated debt about their interest payments.
Mercury faces a federal investigation and several shareholder lawsuits after its January announcement that it had to restate financial results to show lower profits due to accounting irregularities.
The company lost more than $2 billion in market capitalisation after its stock price plunged on the news of the restatement. The stock fell in January from $14 to less than $2 per share. It rose 25 cents to $2.875 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Under the terms of the waivers, during the 90-day period, Mercury will resume interest payments on nearly all of its roughly $1 billion in debt and will pay any past-due interest.
Mercury received the $50 million in short-term financing from Bank of America a month ago. It is being used to meet daily operating expenses and interest payments.
The 90-day extension is ""certainly a good sign,"" said Katrina Blecher, financial analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co. ""I don't think it was unexpected,"" she said. ""But they have to get permanent financing. My gut says they'll probably be able to do it. I would certainly would not write the company off.""

KevinDrawbaugh,"Boehringer Mannheim Corp, a unit of privately held Corange Ltd, said data released Monday at an American College of Cardiology conference leveled the playing field between Boehringer and Genentech Inc in the market for clot-busting drugs to treat acute heart attack.
""What this study showed was comparability between the two products.... Essentially, at this point it will be a marketing fight,"" said Gregory Fulton, director of marketing for Boehringer's pharmaceuticals unit.  
Results from the GUSTO III study showed that Boehringer's Retavase did not save more lives than Genentech's Activase, better known as TPA, researchers reported. In the trial, 10,139 patients received Retavase, while 4,921 patients received TPA. Both drugs, as well as another called streptokinase, are commonly administered within six hours after a heart attack.
""Retavase...did not provide statistically significant benefit in 30-day mortality as compared to (TPA),"" Genentech said in a statement released in conjunction with reporting of the data.  
As a result, Genentech said, Retavase failed to score the win which Boehringer had hoped for from the study -- proof that the drug is better than TPA, long the dominant drug in the field.
""We do not dispute that. The results were very clear,"" said Boehringer's Fulton. At the same time, he said, GUSTO III showed the two drugs to be roughly comparable and Boehringer is ""very happy with that.""
The researchers reported that the study's 30-day mortality rate was 7.43 percent for Retavase, versus 7.22 percent for TPA; total intracranial bleeding rate for Retavase was 0.91 percent and 0.88 percent for TPA; and total stroke rate for Retavase was 1.67 percent and 1.83 percent for TPA.
""GUSTO III reinforces the role (TPA) plays in savings lives every day,"" Genentech vice president of clinical research Dr. David Stump said in a statement.

KevinDrawbaugh,"CardioThoracic Systems Inc is exceeding its internal targets for increasing the number of cardiac surgeries done worldwide using equipment for operating on a beating heart without cracking the chest.
At each of 12 centers around the world, surgeons are doing about 11 surgeries per month with the company's new devices, up from none a year ago, said chief executive Richard Ferrari.
""We're above our target"" for procedure rates, he said on Monday in an interview with Reuters prior to a presentation to investors here at a Dain Bosworth conference.  
To date, more than 200 minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass, or MIDCAB, surgeries using the company's equipment have been performed. Three-quarters of the surgeries have been single blood-vessel grafts, with one-quarter involving multiple-vessel bypasses. The complication rate of one percent is lower than traditional procedures, Ferrari said.  
The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is gearing up to train more surgeons to use its equipment. ""If we're doing everything perfectly, we'll graduate 80 surgical teams per quarter,"" Ferrari said, adding he is confident that some Wall Street expectations for CardioThoracic may be met.
The company is comfortable with analysts' estimates of 1997 sales reaching about $11 million, versus no revenue this year. ""That is a fair number,"" Ferrari said.
Piper Jaffray projects sales rising to $50.5 million in 1998 and $108.9 million in 1999.  
CardioThoracic also is comfortable with analysts' projections of a loss of $1.48 per share this year and a loss of $1.38 per share next year, Ferrari said.
Chief financial officer Steve Van Dick said, ""We'll reach breakeven in mid- to early-1998, with just a slight profit. I don't expect we will end 1997 in the black.""  
Capturing even a small part of the 1.9 million heart revascularizations done annually in the United States would make its revenue projections achievable, Ferrari said. Each single-use MIDCAB toolkit is priced at about $2,500. ""For 1997, CTS' projection is 4,000 procedures. In 1998, it's 17,000 and in 1999, it's 50,000,"" he said.
The total cost of a MIDCAB procedure is about $15,000 -- less than an open-heart coronary artery bypass graft and equal to or more expensive than some other alternatives.  
MIDCAB is performed using devices allowing the surgeon to work on a beating heart through small holes in the chest, eliminating the need for the huge incision and cardio-pulmonary bypass circuit that are standard in open-heart surgery.
Larger companies, such as Medtronic Inc and Genzyme Corp, are moving into the young market for MIDCAB equipment. ""It legitimizes a lot of things we've been saying for a while,"" Ferrari said.  
While larger competitors may pose a competitive threat, Ferrari said CardioThoracic feels secure in its lead in research and development, patent protections and regulatory filings. ""We have much more knowledge about this than they do. We have a huge start ... It's a couple of years,"" he said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May gave marketing clearance to two of CardioThoracic's five MIDCAB tools -- the access platform and the stabilizer.
A 510k application for marketing clearance has been filed with the FDA for a distal perfusion device. The company expects to file 510k's for a stitcher and an artery harvester this month, Ferrari said.
The company continues to expect to have the entire tool kit approved for more active marketing by early 1997, he said.
The company wants to do its own marketing and distribution in the United States, but will seek partners for non-U.S. markets. ""There have been some people who have expressed some preliminary interest in what we're doing,"" he said.
The company is seeking European Union marketing approvals. ""We've not focused on the Japanese market yet,"" Ferrari said.

KevinDrawbaugh,"Diametrics Medical Inc plans to be profitable by the 1998 third quarter and generate revenues of $3.5 million this year, $8 million in 1997 and $18 million in 1998, said chief executive David Giddings.
""Our objective is to have our first profitable quarter in the third quarter of '98,"" Giddings said in an interview with Reuters at a Dain Bosworth conference here on Wednesday.
He said Diametrics -- a maker of hospital-bedside blood gas analysis systems -- has failed to deliver on its promises in the past, but he added, ""That wasn't on my watch.""  
Diametrics reported a 1995 year-end loss of $23 million.
The company expects to launch its new IRMA SL blood gas analyzer system this month. ""The way the market should judge us is by what we do over the next three months,"" he said.
He added that the company has several options before it in the way of possible corporate alliances.
The IRMA is a portable, four-pound instrument that measures blood levels of oxygen, acidity, carbon dioxide, electrolytes and red blood cell volume much faster than competing systems requiring analysis to be done in the hospital laboratory.  
The SL version adds features not seen in older models.
Shares in Diametrics were up 3/8 at 5-1/4.
One year ago, Diametric shares traded as high as 12, but delays in delivering new products wrecked Wall Street forecasting models and the stock suffered.
Giddings started with six-year-old Diametrics in April after a management shake-up prompted by the company's failure to move beyond the research and development phase.
Shortly after arriving, Giddings pushed through an 18- percent workforce cut and said Wednesday he would not rule out the possibility of further cuts, depending on results.
The Roseville, Minn.-based company's work force now numbers 174 people, down from 223.
""We have a goal of being profitable in the third quarter of 1998 and we will do what it takes to hit that objective in terms of our cost base,"" Giddings said.

KevinDrawbaugh,"Wheelabrator Technologies Inc indefinitely deferred a $350-million Dutch auction stock buyback because its parent company -- WMX Technologies Inc -- has no chief executive, said Wheelabrator chief financial officer Robert Gagalis on Tuesday.
In an interview with Reuters, Gagalis said, ""We wanted to maintain some flexibility to get a new CEO up to speed on Wheelabrator's business and how it fits into WMX and all those kinds of things.""
Shares in Wheelabrator were off one to 12-7/8.  
Wall Street analysts said the Dutch auction deferral was a surprise that stirred new doubts about WMX and its majority owned Wheelabrator subsidiary.
""Whenever you put off something like this, it's just going to create uncertainty in investors' minds,"" said A.G. Edwards industry analyst Tore Stole.
Wheelabrator, based in Hampton, N.H., had announced in February that it would increase its stock repurchase program to 30 million shares, including a Dutch auction to take place in the second quarter of this year. In a Dutch auction, a price is set, then lowered until a responsive bid comes in.  
Analysts speculated that Wheelabrator may have been displeased with initial indications of prices likely to be paid in such an auction. But that was not the case, Gagalis said. ""The rationale for the change in strategy was tied to WMX's search for a new CEO,"" he said.
The Wheelabrator auction was to have been just one part of a massive restructuring of WMX and affiliates that otherwise is progressing. The Waste Management Inc unit of WMX said last week it agreed to sell most of its Canadian assets to the Canadian unit of USA Waste Services Inc -- the latest step in WMX's plan to divest $1.5 billion in assets.  
Under pressure from unhappy shareholders, WMX -- the largest U.S. garbage hauler -- also is in the process of finding a new chief executive, cutting 3,000 jobs, and doing its own Dutch auction for $1 billion. ""They're making progress,"" said Parker/Hunter industry analyst Richard Sporrer.
Analysts were unsure about the broader meaning of the Wheelabrator deferral, especially when viewed in light of the resignation last month of WMX chief executive Philip Rooney, architect of the WMX restructuring strategy.  
Tuesday's news could signal that Rooney's plans are being back-burnered, said Edward Jones analyst William Fiala. ""It would make sense because they're going to have a new CEO ... and they're going to want him to have more say in the decisions affecting the future of the company,"" Fiala said.
Gagalis said he is unaware of any further impending delays or changes in the WMX shake-up. He said WMX plans to proceed with its own, $1-billion Dutch auction in April.
""In terms of all the other aspects of the WMX plan, I think everything else is being implemented as previously announced,"" Gagalis said.
Sporrer said, ""Not having a CEO will stretch out to some degree the restructuring efforts they've been talking about. But I don't think it will be material ... Waste Management has spent a lot of time thinking through these changes. I don't think they're going to back off.""

KevinDrawbaugh,"Eli Lilly &amp; Co is fighting in Kentucky this week to end the last major legal battle still lingering from Prozac's liability troubles of the early 1990s.
The Indianapolis-based drug giant Wednesday asked the Kentucky Court of Appeals to halt a hearing set for Thursday in Louisville before Jefferson Circuit Judge John Potter.
Potter's hearing would likely reveal publicly how and for how much Lilly and plaintiffs agreed to end a landmark case involving Prozac and a 1989 mass murder in Louisville.  
Lilly wants to keep the details of the agreement under wraps, although it conceded for the first time Monday that the so-called Joseph Wesbecker case was settled, at least in part.
For months, the company had said only that it reached a pre-verdict agreement in the case and that an unspecified amount of money changed hands as a result.
""We acknowledge that after the jury verdict, the high-low agreement provided for settlement of the compensatory and punitive damage phases of the trial,"" said Lilly spokesman Edward West Wednesday in a telephone interview.  
That acknowledgment allowed Potter to amend the Wesbecker verdict to say the case was ""dismissed as settled"" -- a legal intricacy he and Lilly have wrangled over since 1994.
""After nearly two-and-a-half years of this, we and the plaintiffs said to (Potter) Monday ... enter your corrected judgment. If that's what you think you need to do to be at peace with this matter, then do that,"" West said. ""It's time to put this matter to rest ... We have nothing to hide.""  
Wall Street considers the disputed deal that ended the Wesbecker case a non-event. Analysts said major drug companies often pay plaintiffs ""hush money"" in liability cases, but Lilly has fought any revelations by Potter's court about the company's arrangement with the Wesbecker plaintiffs.
""There is a confidentiality agreement in place ... We've honored that,"" West said.
In 1989, while on Prozac and other drugs, 47-year-old Joseph Wesbecker walked into his former workplace in Louisville with an AK-47 assault rifle and went on a shooting rampage.  
He killed eight people, wounded 12, and then committed suicide.
Survivors of the Standard Gravure Printing plant massacre and victims' families sued Lilly for $50 million, alleging that Prozac drove Wesbecker to his horrible end. A flood of more than 160 similar legal actions followed and Prozac came under national legal and scientific scrutiny.
Potter presided over the 47-day Wesbecker lawsuit trial in late 1994 and early 1995.  
The jury found Lilly not liable in the case and Potter dismissed it. But in April 1995, he had second thoughts because he said he suspected the case had been secretly settled out of court. He filed a motion that the verdict be changed to say that the case was ""dismissed as settled.""
Lilly fought the motion, but the Kentucky Supreme Court ordered Potter to look into the matter because, the court said, it suspected ""there may have been deception, bad faith conduct, abuse of the judicial process or perhaps even fraud.""  
An investigation was conducted by a lawyer for the Kentucky attorney general's office. The probe revealed the nature and cost of the pre-verdict agreement that Lilly has since acknowledged making. But many of the facts surrounding the agreement, including its price-tag, remain under wraps.
Potter declined to comment Tuesday on the objectives of the hearing he hopes to convene.
West said, ""Judge Potter ... has stated on the record he intends to release the aggregate amount of the agreement.""
To this day, Lilly defends Prozac as safe and has been backed by panels of medical experts. Until this week, the company also contended it had never lost or settled any of the Prozac court cases. Despite the settlement of the damages phase of the Wesbecker trial, West said, the fact remains that the jury cleared Lilly on the question of liability.
""They heard everything about Prozac and decided that the product had nothing to do with Wesbecker's actions,"" he said.

KevinDrawbaugh,"The tough job of reversing the steady decline of Snapple sales passed Thursday from Quaker Oats Co, which couldn't pull it off, to a firm that rescued the similar Mistic beverage line last year, but which is itself in transition.
In agreeing to acquire Snapple for $300 million in cash, Triarc Cos Inc took on a task at which Quaker labored for 2-1/2 years without success. At the same time, Triarc's deal cast a new light on its pending plans to spin off its beverage and fast-food businesses, analysts said.  
Buying Snapple could affect the proposed spinoff of Mistic, Royal Crown soft drinks and Arby's restaurants into a new company, said Triarc spokesman Martin Shea. ""We're waiting for an IRS ruling"" on the spinoff, he said.
The effect could be a plus, said analysts, who suggested the deal shows Triarc is serious about making sense out of its jumble of assets and becoming a player in consumer brands.
""This new management team at Triarc is damn good,"" said Wheat First Butcher Singer food industry analyst John Maxwell.
Based in New York, Triarc was pieced together during the anything-goes junk-bond era by Victor Posner, analysts said.  
Posner exited when Triarc was taken over by financiers Nelson Peltz and Peter May in 1993. They have since followed a course of asset redistribution aimed at rationalizing Triarc's businesses and attracting more Wall Street attention.
In the past four years, Triarc has gained new respect, sold 16 businesses, paid off $500 million in debt and raised $200 million in cash, Shea said.
The firm bought Mistic for $95 million in 1995. In 1996, the juice line posted sales of $130 million. Triarc's Royal Crown soft drink line had 1996 sales of about $175 million, said Triarc beverage chief executive Michael Weinstein.  
""We know how to make a brand succeed,"" Weinstein said.
That knowledge will be needed to turn around Snapple. The brand virtually invented the premium soft drink category, and it remains the market leader. But Snapple sales have declined every year since 1994. Last year, they were $551 million, down eight percent from 1995, Quaker reported.
Quaker, the Chicago-based food giant, acquired Snapple in December 1994 near the height of its popularity for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs. The sale price agreed to this week with Triarc will force Quaker to post a $1.4 billion one-time loss in its first quarter.  
""The (Snapple) investment's been a disaster"" for Quaker, said Prudential Securities food analyst John McMillin.
Wall Street treated Quaker kindly Thursday, however, following the announcement of the sale, reflecting some relief that the company finally sold off the money-losing unit.
Shares in Quaker -- which retains such crown jewel products as Gatorade and several cereal brands -- closed up 1/4 at 37-3/4. Shares in Triarc closed up 1-5/8 at 17-3/8.

KevinDrawbaugh,"Quaker Oats Co. conceded defeat Thursday in its effort to turn around its struggling Snapple beverage unit and agreed to sell it for $300 million -- $1.4 billion less than it paid for the business -- to Triarc Cos. Inc., the owner of rival Mistic beverages.
The selling price -- far below the $1.7 billion Quaker paid for the premium beverage company in 1994 -- disappointed Wall Street, but analysts said they were pleased that Quaker did the deal.
""It was a fire sale price ... The bad news is the investment has been a disaster, the good news is they're trying to put it behind them,"" said John McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential Securities, a brokerage and investment bank.
Snapple's ready-to-drink teas and juices virtually invented the premium soft drink market and remain a leader, with more than $500 million in 1996 sales. But Snapple has lost money ever since Chicago-based Quaker -- better known for its breakfast cereals and Gatorade sports drinks -- bought it.
Snapple sales fell 8 percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, the company reported last month.
""The decision to sell Snapple was reached after an extensive review of various shareholder value-building options by management,"" said Quaker Chairman William Smithburg in a statement.
""After reviewing all possible options, we decided it was in the shareholders' interest to remove the financial burdens and risks Snapple brought to the portfolio and better focus on our value-driving businesses,"" Smithburg said.
New York-based Triarc, the buyer, owns the Mistic drinks business, a Snapple rival. It also owns Royal Crown soft drinks, Arby's Inc. fast-food restaurants and other businesses.
""With respect to Triarc, this transaction is very positive ... it is complementary to Triarc's existing position in Mistic, which is fruit juices, while Snapple is mostly teas,"" said Michael Branca, a food industry analyst at Lehman Brothers, a brokerage and investment bank.
""In addition, Triarc's beverage management is highly respected in the beverage distribution business ... Snapple could well be reborn under Triarc,"" Branca said.
Triarc Beverage Group Chief Executive Michael Weinstein said his company plans to apply similar marketing principles to Snapple that it used to turn around the Mistic line.
Triarc will consult distributors and review the consumer research on Snapple, and ""Then we're going to move like hell to do some really cool, innovative things in packaging and product and advertising to try to build the brand back up again,"" Weinstein said.
Triarc bought the Mistic juices line from a sole proprietor for $95 million in August 1995. It had sales of about $130 million in 1996.
""We have a track record in this category with Mistic, of taking a brand that was slumping and applying some basic principles ... to it. We know how to make a brand succeed. We're more entrepreneurial,"" Weinstein said.
Quaker's stock rose  25 cents to $37.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Triarc rose $1.625 to $17.375.
Quaker said it would take a non-cash pretax charge of about $1.4 billion, or $8.40 a share, in its first quarter, to record the loss on the sale.
The company also said it would be able to recoup about $250 million in taxes paid on previous capital gains, ""making the cash value of the transaction approximately $550 million.""
A Quaker spokesman said the tax consideration was a key part of the company's decision to sell Snapple to Triarc now.
The spokesman added that Triarc had indicated it intends to transfer virtually all Snapple employees with the business.
Triarc said it expected to close the deal by the end of June, subject to customary conditions, including government antitrust clearance.
Besides Snapple, Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life.
""Quaker still has the crown jewels -- Gatorade and the cereals -- and performance in those businesses has been pretty good,"" said food industry analyst George Staphos of the investment bank and brokerage of PaineWebber.
""The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back,"" said John O'Neil, food industry analyst at BT Securities.
"
KevinDrawbaugh,"Triarc Cos Inc plans to apply the same marketing principles to Snapple that it used to turn around the Mistic beverage line -- minus Dennis Rodman -- said Triarc Beverage Group chief executive Michael Weinstein.
""We used Dennis in our Mistic commercials this year, which was perfect,"" Weinstein said in an interview with Reuters.
But the quirky Chicago Bulls basketball forward is unlikely to be endorsing Snapple, which Triarc said Thursday it will acquire from Quaker Oats Co for $300 million.
""No, no.  Dennis is the Mistic guy,"" Weinstein said.  
Edgy advertising, careful attention to distributor relationships, colorful labelling and a focus on cold-bottle street sales comprised Triarc's successful formula for Mistic and will set the tune for Snapple, too, he said.
After the deal with Quaker closes, Triarc will consult distributors and review the consumer research on Snapple. ""Then we're going to move like hell to do some really cool, innovative things in packaging and product and advertising to try to build the brand back up again,"" Weinstein said.
Snapple sales in 1996 were about $550 million, down eight percent from 1995 under Quaker's unsuccessful management.  
Triarc has not yet set Snapple sales targets and is taking a long-term approach, Weinstein said.  ""Our focus is on 1998. You can't take over a brand and then snap your fingers and have it turn around overnight.  But we believe that there are lots of opportunities for growth,"" he said.
Taking on Snapple will nearly triple Triarc's beverage revenues.  ""I'm going to be busy.  I'm going to have to start coming in in the afternoons now,"" he said.
New York-based Triarc is a diversified company that is 25-percent owned by financiers Nelson Peltz and Peter May. They bought it from Victor Posner in 1993 for $72 million.  
Since then, Triarc has sold off 16 businesses, paid off $500 million in debt and raised $200 million in cash.  The objective, said Triarc spokesman Martin Shea, has been to create a consumer brands business.
Triarc bought the Mistic juices line from a sole proprietor for $95 million in August 1995.  Mistic had sales in 1996 of about $130 million.
""We have a track record in this category with Mistic, of taking a brand that was slumping and applying some basic principles ... to it. We know how to make a brand succeed. We're more entrepreneurial,"" Weinstein said.
Snapple, the brand that virtually created the premium soft drinks category, was bought by Chicago-based Quaker two-and-a-half years ago but has lost money ever since.

KevinDrawbaugh,"By selling its Snapple beverage business for $300 million, Quaker Oats Co on Thursday both disappointed and relieved Wall Street.
The price was far lower than analysts following the company said they had hoped Quaker would be able to get.
""It was a fire-sale price.  I'd been using $600 to $700 million"" as an estimated value for Snapple, said Prudential Securities food industry analyst John McMillin.
At the same time, analysts said they were relieved that Quaker was ending its disastrous Snapple venture.  
""The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back,"" said BT Securities food industry analyst John O'Neil.
Shares in Quaker were up 3/8 to 37-7/8 in late morning on heavy volume, after trading as high as 39-1/2.  Shares in Triarc Cos Inc, which is buying the Snapple line from Quaker, were up one to 16-3/4 after trading as high as 18.
Triarc owns the Mistic and Royal Crown beverage lines, as well as Arby's Inc fast-food restaurants and liquefied petroleum and specialty dyes and chemicals businesses.  
Chicago-based Quaker bought Snapple for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs, two-and-a-half years ago near the height of the alternative beverage brand's popularity.
Since the purchase, widely seen by analysts as overvalued, Quaker has struggled with the line of ready-to-drink teas and juices.  Snapple sales declined eight percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, and the business ran at a cash loss, the company reported last month.
""The bad news is the (Snapple) investment's been a disaster; the good news is they're trying to put it behind them,"" McMillin said.

Quaker said that as a result of the sale, its earnings -- excluding the one-time loss -- were expected to increase by about 10 cents a share in 1997 as debt is reduced and Snapple losses removed.
For all of 1996, Quaker earned $248 million, or $1.80 a share, on revenues of $5.2 billion.

KevinDrawbaugh,"United Wisconsin Services Inc expects its medical-loss ratio to decline to levels not seen in years as long as Washington does not spring another healthcare reform initiative on the HMO industry.
In an interview with Reuters, United Wisconsin chief executive Thomas Hefty said the ratio -- the share of premium revenues spent covering HMO members' healthcare costs -- could fall into the seventies. ""The loss ratio is higher than we would like, but we're seeing, particularly in our small-group PPO unit, an improvement over last year,"" Hefty said.  
United Wisconsin finished its second quarter in June with its medical-loss ratio at 81.9 percent, down from 88.3 percent a year earlier. Hefty said it could fall to the seventies.
Premium revenues that are left over after covering member costs constitute the bulk of profits for a health maintenance organization, or HMO. ""We think the industry overall is poised for a better 1997 and 1998,"" Hefty said. ""Probably the biggest uncertainty in the market is the reaction to the election.""
When the Clinton administration unveiled its healthcare reform proposal in 1994, medical cost inflation plummeted and HMO profits soared.  
When healthcare reform failed, medical cost inflation roared back and profits suffered industry-wide. These trends have moderated recently, Hefty said, but he added that Hillary Clinton's speech at the Democratic Convention caused concern.
""It said that if the Democrats have a big victory, we'll see healthcare reform again with all of the interplay on the psychology of patients and physicians,"" he said.
In the meantime, Hefty said he sees room for premium hikes to boost HMOs' profits. ""In our market in Wisconsin, we compete against Humana and United Healthcare and both of them have been taking strong pricing action,"" he said.
""We're out there with price increases. Underlying healthcare trends have been coming down again,"" Hefty said.
Enrollment at United Wisconsin is growing, as well ""The Milwaukee HMO has a lost a little bit of enrollment with price increases, but we're still overall up a couple percent"" due to enrollment gains in the company's rural HMOs, he said.
""Our strategy is to keep looking for the rural markets ... We think those are good markets. You get better margins and we've shown the ability to not only get those margins, but get operating costs down,"" Hefty said.
"
KevinDrawbaugh,"Stericycle Inc said it is comfortable with Wall Street estimates of an operating-basis break-even third quarter, a fourth-quarter operating profit and a profitable year for the first time in 1997.
""The Dillon Read report has us punching through on an operating profit in the fourth quarter of this year, with break-even at the operating line in the third quarter...We're very comfortable with a profitable year,"" chief executive Mark Miller said in an interview Tuesday with Reuters.  
Stericycle lost $2.4 million, or $0.30 per share, in 1996.
As for the possibility of moving into the black in the first quarter, Miller added: ""We're going to be pretty close.""
In business since 1989, Deerfield, Ill.-based Stericycle has never turned a profit and its stock has languished below its $9 per share initial public offering price of last August.
Shares were unchanged at eight on very light volume Tuesday.
Boosted by a recent acquisition, accelerating internal growth and the withdrawal from the market of some key rivals, Stericycle looks to 1997 as a possible breakout year.  
At its present run rate, Stericycle 1997 revenues would be ""north of $36 million,"" Miller said.
Although 1996 revenues were just $24.5 million, Stericycle is the second-largest player in a $1 billion U.S. market from which larger competitors are fleeing.
Houston's Browning-Ferris Industries Inc remains the largest medical waste handler, but BFI is selling assets as part of a back-to-basics restructuring. If BFI decided to exit, Miller said: ""We would obviously love to buy it.""  
In December, Stericycle acquired the bulk of Waste Management's medical waste business for $11 million in cash and notes. Waste Management parent WMX Technologies Inc is also in the midst of a corporate restructuring.
Canada's Laidlaw Inc is also in the process of separating itself from the medical waste business. The remainder of the market is divided among many smaller firms.
""We see ourselves as the best consolidator opportunity for the vast majority of sellers,"" Miller said.  
More market share may become available to Stericycle beginning this summer as major hospitals with on-site waste incinerators confront new federal emission regulations.
""We think that will create new opportunities,"" he said.
While hospitals remain Stericycle's core business, sales and marketing is focused on physician offices, nursing homes, laboratories, outpatient surgical centers and clinics.
These smaller generators of waste present Stericycle with fatter profit margins and better growth opportunities as managed healthcare drives more medical procedures out of of acute care hospitals and into sub-acute facilities.
""These are the people that really need the outsourcing that we offer,"" Miller said.
Alternate site business was up 59 percent in the fourth quarter year-over-year, while the core hospital business was up 13 percent in the fourth quarter.
Partly as a result, the company's overall 1996 revenues grew 15 percent over 1995, while margins expanded 33 percent.

KevinMorrison,"Building materials group Boral Ltd is expected to report a lower net profit before abnormals for the six months to December 31 on Wednesday, but the results should show signs of an improving housing market, analysts said.
Building material analysts contacted by Reuters forecast Boral to report a pre-abnormal net profit of between A$89 million and A$93 million for the 1996/97 half year, compared with A$120 million a year earlier.
Analysts said although the first half was likely to be down on a year ago it should be up on the 1995/96 second half.  
BZW Australia building material analyst Greg Burns forecasts Boral to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$89 million for the December half.
""Non-residentials are as strong as an ox, and it has been for many quarters, and housing, as far as approvals are concerned, bottomed in September,"" Burns told Reuters.
""I just think the six months to December will not have enough good news in it to get too excited,"" Burns said.
ANZ Securities building materials analyst Sean Cooney estimates Boral to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$93 million for the six month period.  
Cooney said Australian building material companies had been reporting disappointing results for some time and Boral was unlikely to any exception.
Last week Pioneer International Ltd reported a 18.3 percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half.
""Things have looked worst than some people have expected in Australia's housing market and because Boral has got a fairly significant exposure compared to the others, you expect it to be a bit more worse hit then the others,"" Cooney told Reuters.
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett analyst Fabian Babich forecast a net profit before abnormals of A$90 million for the first half.  
Merrill Lynch building materials analyst Michael Brown forecast a first half pre-abnormal net profit of A$90 million.
John North at J.B. Were &amp; Son also estimated Boral to report a pre-abnormal net profit of A$90 million.
Analysts said they expected Boral to pay a first half dividend of 7.5 cents.
In November, Boral said it would maintain a 7.5 cents per share dividend for the December half, the same amount it paid in the 1995/96 second half.
Boral paid a 10.5 cents dividend in the 1995/96 first half.  
Although analysts were in a narrow range for the first half result, forecasts for the 1996/97 full year varied from A$163.8 million to A$190 million for pre-abnormal net profit.
Boral reported a net profit before abnormals of A$170.9 million for the year to June 30, 1996.
Shares in the Sydney-based group have traded in a range between A$2.91 and A$3.70 since June 1996, when they were around A.
At 1.45 p.m. (0245 GMT), Boral shares were two cents lower at A$3.48.

KevinMorrison,"Australian appliance, packaging and wine group Southcorp Holdings Ltd on Tuesday reported a 22.3 percent rise in first half net profit and tipped a record result for the year to June 30.
Southcorp posted a net profit after abnormals of A$64.92 million for the six months ended December 31, 1996, compared with A$52.36 million a year earlier.
""We are now on track to meet our year-end forecast and our year-end forecast is broadly in line with market expectations,"" chief executive officer Graham Kraehe told reporters.  
Kraehe said market expectations were around A$130 million net profit before abnormals. Southcorp reported a net profit of A$124.22 million in 1995/96, which included a record second half profit of A$64.3 million.
""Each business, we expect, in the full year, as they have in the last two periods, to grow earnings over the corresponding period,"" he said.
Kraehe said the forecasts were dependent on there being no significant downturn in the Australian economy.
""On that basis, we are very confident that 1996/97 will be another record year for Southcorp.""  
The December 1996 half results showed a profit improvement for all three divisions, with its appliance division growing the strongest despite lower sales.
Kraehe said in a statement the strong appliance division result reflected cost cuts and better productivity, supported by the launch of a range of new whitegoods products.
But its American Water Heater business, formerly called Mor-Flo, continued to make losses although they were half of the A$2.1 million loss in the June 1996 period.
Group sales fell 0.5 percent to A$1.30 billion in the first half and dividends were steady at 8.25 cents a share.  
Kraehe said Southcorp was still on the prowl for more acquisitions in the wine business, particularly in overseas markets, and also add-on acquisitions in packaging.
""For acquisitions, we are looking at, internationally in wine and in areas in packaging, which add on to our core businesses, either in Australia, North America or Asia.""
""We are also looking at some Asian development, which will essentially be greenfield development,"" Kraehe said.
Southcorp is currently building a manufacturing plant in Dalian, China, to make steel and aluminium cans.  
""Whatever we do (in wine), if it is in Australia or if it is something offshore, the end result is that it is going to be able to better serve the international markets, that says that the probability is that it (acquisition) is going to be offshore,"" Kraehe said.
""In Australia our primary focus is to continue to invest in our our strong vineyard and winery facilities...with a heavy focus on red (wine),"" he said.
Southcorp made two wine acqusitions in Australia in 1996 but had no plans to raise new funds for any more purchases.  
""Our gearing has come down to a pretty comfortable level, if we wanted to do something major, particularly something major in wine, that could cause us to look at means of raising capital,"" Kraehe said.
""But generally speaking we could fund an acquisition and development programmes within our existing cash flow,"" he said.
Southcorp's net debt to equity fell to 63.7 percent in the December half, from 72.1 percent a year earlier.
Southcorp shares closed steady at A$4.56. The shares hit a record high of A$4.66 last Tuesday.

KevinMorrison,"Optus Communications Pty Ltd, Australia's second largest telecommunications carrier, said on Wednesday it expects a strong result for the year to June 30 and aimed for a sharemarket float in 1997 despite litigation delays.
Optus also formally reported a net profit of A$58.9 million (US$46.4 million) in the six months ended December 31, 1996, up from A$7.1 million a year earlier.
Sales rose 31.2 percent to A$1.19 billion, buoyed by a strong lift in revenue from its mobile phone business. Sales are expected to continue the strong trend in the 1996/97 second half, chief operating officer Phil Jacobs told Reuters.
""It will be somewhere (near) a similar amount,"" Jacobs said.
""We are expecting a very strong result for the full year,"" Optus chief executive officer Ziggy Switkowski told reporters at a briefing after the results announcement. Optus reported a profit of A$60.3 million for the 1995/96 year.
Optus still planned a sharemarket float in calendar 1997 but that would have to await the outcome of litigation between its pay television offshoot, Optus Vision, and free-to-air television station Seven Network Ltd, Switkowski said.
Asked if Optus Communications would postpone its float beyond this year, Switkowski said: ""No, not at all. The float is clearly held up by the process of the litigation. Once the litigation is resolved, the board will meet and make decisions about how the float should proceed.
""The timetable for this year is still very much our desire,"" Switkowski said.
However, Switkowski said there was a possibility Optus's planned float would clash with the timing of the sale of one-third of the government-owned Telstra Corp, Australia's biggest carrier, which is seen by analysts as a far bigger capital-raising operation than for Optus.
""It is not impossible that those floats will happen about the same time, we will see later this year,"" he said.
Switkowski would not comment on the litigation battle which, if Optus loses, could see it forced to sell its Vision stake at a discount to Seven.
Optus Communications has pumped about A$605 million into Optus Vision, which is currently rolling out its cable network to 2.5 million homes or 40 percent of Australian households at a cost of about A$3.0 billion.
The full deregulation of the Australian telecommunications industry on July 1, 1997, would pressure margins, Jacobs said.
""There is no doubt that there will be erosion in some areas of our business as competition comes in...but we fully expect that erosion of (market) share would be more than offset by the continued growth of the business,"" Jacobs said.
Australian telecommunications analysts welcomed the result, but described post-deregulation as a ""big unknown"" for Optus.
""The rest of this year looks all right, but the big question mark is next year, with all the new players coming into the market. It's hard to know what effect it is going to have on Optus,"" one Sydney-based analyst said.
Market analysts expect global operators such as British Telecom and the U.S. giant AT&amp;T to enter a deregulated Australian market later this year.
Optus was set up in 1992 as a partial deregulation of the local market, which was previously a government monopoly.
The Sydney-based group is 25 percent owned by Australian transport group Mayne Nickless Ltd and 24.5 percent each owned by Cable and Wireless Plc of Britain and U.S. telephone carrier BellSouth Corp Inc.
The remainder is owned by Australian institutions.

KevinMorrison,"Australian media group Publishing and Broadcasting, controlled by billionaire Kerry Packer, on Wednesday reported a lower 1996/97 first half net profit due to weaker television and magazine advertising sales.
PBL, which is about 45 percent owned by the Packer family, reported a net profit of A$104.30 million (US$82 million) in the six months ended December 31, 1996, down from A$107.66 million a year earlier.
However the Sydney-based media group noted the 1995/96 result had been boosted by an abnormal gain, and said earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) would be slightly higher in the year to June 30, 1997 compared with the previous year.
""The group overall should end this financial year in EBIT terms slightly ahead of last year,"" said PBL managing director James Packer, Kerry's only son.
""Our television and magazines divisions continue to operate in a very soft advertising market, with little prospect of any significant improvement in the second half,"" he said.
PBL is Australia's largest magazine publisher, while the Nine Network is the nation's largest TV network. Overall sales fell 2.2 percent to A$581.56 million for the half.
Earnings from PBL's Nine Network television network were likely to be flat in the second half, compared with a year earlier, due to higher costs associated with additional movies becoming available, Packer said.
Despite the profit drop, PBL raised its dividend payment to shareholders to nine cents a share from seven cents a year ago.
PBL's third arm, its Enterprise division, includes its 15 percent investment in Australia's oldest newspaper group John Fairfax Holdings Ltd, U.S. film production house Regency Enterprises and Australia satellite TV operator Australis Media.
Kerry Packer has long held an ambition to take over the Fairfax newspaper empire, publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and business daily Australian Financial Review.
""Our strategic goals towards Fairfax remain unchanged and we await the outcome of the government's review of the cross-media laws,"" James Packer said.
The Liberal-National government is expected to announce by mid-1997 the results of its cross-media ownership laws.
Under the current cross-media regulations, media owners are not allowed to have large shareholdings in both broadcast and print media in the same market.
Australian media analysts said PBL's first half result was a little stronger than expected. They said the full year result was unlikely to include any contribution from Packer's recent investment in the Sydney casino.
PBL shares ended one cent up at A$6.35 after shedding 14 cents earlier in the day.

KevinMorrison,"Australia's second largest telecom carrier Optus Communications Pty Ltd said on Wednesday it expects a strong result for the June 30 year and still aimed for a sharemarket float in 1997, despite litigation delays.
Optus also formally reported a net profit of A$58.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 1996, up from A$7.1 million a year earlier. The result was first announced last week by its 25 percent shareholder Mayne Nickless Ltd.
""We are expecting a very strong result for the full year,"" Optus chief executive officer Ziggy Switkowski told reporters.  
Optus reported a profit of A$60.3 million for the 1995/96 year, which compared with a loss of A$17.0 million in 1994/95.
Sales rose 31.2 percent to A$1.19 billion, buoyed by a strong lift in revenue from its mobile business.
Chief operating officer Phil Jacobs told Reuters he expected sales to continue the strong trend in the 1996/97 second half.
""It will be somewhere by a similar amount,"" Jacobs said.
Switkowski said Optus still planned a sharemarket float in calendar 1997, but a float would have to await the outcome of the litigation between its 46.5 percent owned associate Optus Vision and television station Seven Network Ltd.  
Asked at a media briefing if Optus Communications would put off its float past this year, Switkowski said: ""No, not at all the float is clearly held up by the process of the litigation, once the litigation is resolved, the board will meet and make decisions about how the float should proceed going forward.""
""The timetable for this year is still very much our desire,"" Switkowski said.
However, Switkowski said there was a possibility that Optus' planned float may clash with the timing of the sale of one third of government owned Telstra Corp, which would be a far bigger capital raising than Optus.  
""It does appear that the Telstra float will be at the latter part of the year, so when our schedule is clarified and indeed when the Telstra schedule is clarified, we will have a look at what that means to us,"" Switkowski said.
""It is not impossible that those floats will happen about the same time, we will see later this year,"" he said.
Switkowski would not comment on the litigation between Optus Vision and Seven or Vision's local telephony services launched mid-1996 to break Telstra A$5 billion market monopoly.
But Optus' Jacobs said Optus Communications had other strategies besides using Optus Vision for the local call market.  
Optus Communications has pumped about A$605 million into Optus Vision, which is currently rolling out its cable network to 2.5 million homes or 40 percent of Australian households.
""It has never been Optus Vision's intention to cable up to 100 percent of Australia's population,"" Jacobs told reporters.
""It has been our intention as Optus Communications to offer our services to a wide a customer base as possible and we have from the very beginning looked at a multiple strategy to get to those customers,"" Jacobs said.
If Optus Vision loses its legal battle with Seven, Optus forced to sell its Vision stake at a discount to Seven.  
Jacobs said the full deregulation of Australia's telecom market on July 1, 1997 would put pressure on margins across all of its businesses, but this would be more than offset by growth in the overall telecommunications market.
""There is no doubt that there will be erosion in some areas of our business as competition comes in...but we fully expect that erosion of share would be more than offset by the continued growth of the business,"" Jacobs said.
Optus is also owned 24.5 percent each by Cable and Wireless Plc of Britain and U.S. telephone carrier BellSouth Corp Inc. The remainder is owned by Australian institutions.

KevinMorrison,"Cinema and theme park operator Village Roadshow Ltd said it expected stronger second half earnings fuelled by the expansion of its cinema operations.
""The second half has already started stronger and we are going to start seeing the full six month contribution from the European acquisition and also the contribution from new cinemas we have opened up,"" group general manager Peter Foo told Reuters in an interview.
Village earlier reported a 27 percent rise in net profit to A$26.1 million for the 1996/97 first half.  
Foo said the group was always looking at new opportunities for its cinema expansion, but he would not add if the company was looking at any new countries for expansion.
Cinemas account for the single largest revenue contribution from Village's operation, with about 40 percent of the A$172.95 million in 1996/97 first half sales coming from cinemas.
The remainder its split between radio and theme parks.
Foo said Village was not interested in acquiring the resort island businesses of Qantas Airways Ltd, which the airline has up for sale. The resorts include Great Keppel, Brampton, Bedarra and Lizard Islands offshore Queensland.  
""We are not interested at this stage, we want to focus on our cinema rollout,"" Foo said. He said the company was happy with its existing holiday resort business, Daydream Island.
Village is about 19 percent owned by MAI Plc, a unit of United News and Media Plc. Foo said Village was looking at working with the British media group in some areas.
""We are looking at more co-production work,"" Foo said. Village also has film and television production operations.
Village's radio interests are held through its 53 percent stake in Austereo Ltd, which announced earlier an 11 percent rise in 1996/97 first half profit to A$17.15 million.  
Village shares closed one cent higher at A$4.26.

KevinMorrison,"Building products group Boral Ltd shares topped the turnover charts on Friday as investors ploughed into the building material sector on the back of a change of sentiment for the recently depressed housing sector.
Boral shares jumped 13.6 cents or 3.71 percent to close at A$3.806 on a turnover of 8.8 million shares. The shares ended off their intra-day high of A$3.91, which was their highest level since March 1994.
Fellow building material groups Pioneer International Ltd and CSR Ltd also recorded strong gains.  
Pioneer shares closed at their highest level since the 1987 sharemarket crash, up 14.4 cents or 3.55 percent at A$4.20, while CSR shares ended 14 cents or three percent higher at A$4.81, its highest level since August 1994.
""I think there is just a lot of sentiment around the stocks, people want to get set for the upturn,"" said Chris Haynes, a building materials analyst at broker BT Securities.
Australian housing finance data due out next Thursday are expected to show further recent evidence that the industry is set for an upturn after a two year depression, with construction activity picking up by mid-1997.  
""There is no doubt in people's mind that the physical cycle has turned and that should have been evident three or four months ago, but it takes a while before people are convinced,"" said John North of J.B Were &amp; Son.
Analysts said institutions may have been behind the heavy share trading in Boral, as not many major insitutions have the stock in their portfolio.
""The thing with Boral is that no major institution is on the register, so there are some people who are a little bit worried by not having any of the stock,"" BT's Haynes said.  
Both Boral and Pioneer recently reported lower profits for the six months to December 31, 1996. CSR reported in December.
On Tuesday, Boral reported a net profit of A$93.16 million for the 1995/96 first half, down from A$169.71 million in the 1995/96 first half, but it said it expected a higher profit for the second half to June 30.
Last week, Pioneer reported a net profit of A$112.7 million for the first half, down from A$138.0 million a year earlier.
But, Pioneer said it expected a lower full year profit due to lower returns from its investment in petroleum refiner Ampol.  
However, the current corporate earnings season is seen as reporting mainly in line results with many better than expected results. Analysts said the solid earnings season is also a reason for the change in sentiment for the cyclical stocks.
""The reporting season has significantly decreased the risk attached to the future profit outlook for the sector,"" said Fabian Babich at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
Babich said there was also evidence that volumes are up.
""So if volumes are going up and you have achieved costs savings and you have sold off underperforming businesses, what is going to happen to your profits?...they are going to go up.""  
The only Australian building material group to miss out on the big price jumps was James Hardie Industries Ltd, which had prior to today being the strongest share price performer in the sector ove rthe past 12 months.
James Hardie shares rose one cent to A$3.84 on Friday.
""Hardie is more of a growth story, the others are more of a cyclical story,"" JB Were's North said.
Australia's building material index jumped 2.57 percent and was one of the few rises on Friday with the broader All Ordinaries index down 8,9 points to 2,438.5 points.

KevinMorrison,"Australian government-owned Telstra Corp reported a 38.4-percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half as the costs of shedding almost a third of its workforce started to ring up for the telephone carrier.
Telstra, which is to be partially privatised by the end of the year, also said it was in talks with global telecom carriers about forming possible alliances.
""We are dancing with everyone, but we haven't taken anyone home from the dance yet,"" chief executive officer Frank Blount told reporters after the results announcement.
The Australian carrier reported a net profit after abnormals of A$742.0 million (US$585.4 million) in the six months to December 31, 1996, compared with A$1.20 billion a year ago.
Redundancy costs were A$1.03 billion in the half-year period with staff levels down by 7,000 during the half to about 69,500. Under Telstra's plan announced last September about 22,000 jobs are to go by the end of fiscal 1998/99.
Revenue grew by 4.6 percent to A$7.77 billion in the December half. Blount said first-half revenue was pressured by a slowing economy and increased competition.
It was unlikely revenue would grow any faster for the rest of the year to June 30, 1997, Blount said.
""I think the economy is picking up, but we are still seeing softness in revenue, but it is still growing about the same level as in the first half,"" Blount told reporters.
Telstra is to face stiffer competition in 1997/98 due to the deregulation of the local telecommunications markets from July 1, 1997, although few foreign telecom groups so far have openly stated they would enter the Australia market.
British Telecom Plc (BT) and U.S. telecom giant AT&amp;T Corp have, however, been tipped to enter the local market.
Blount said Telstra had been in talks with BT and its partner MCI Communications Corp, AT&amp;T Corp and the Global One consortium about possible alliances.
""We have had talks with Global One...we have had talks with AT&amp;T...and we have continuing talks with BT/MCI,"" Blount said. Excluding the abnormal losses, Telstra reported a 16.1-percent rise in net profit to A$1.40 billion.
The result was well received by the Australian government, which said the partial Tesltra float is still on for the end of 1997. The government gets to pocket A$625 million in dividend payments from the carrier.
""I think the company is very well placed for privatisation,"" communications minister Richard Alston told reporters in Canberra. ""We're still hopeful that (the sale) will occur before the end of the calendar year,"" Alston said
The government last year moved to sell one-third of Telstra for a projected A$8.0 billion, but recent estimates put the sale price much higher.
Telstra is spending about A$3.5 billion on the rollout of its cable network around Australia, which carries its pay television service Foxtel that it owns jointly with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.
Telstra's share of losses from Foxtel in the half was A$49 million, finance director Paul Rizzo told reporters.
""I am not concerned about the losses of Foxtel, because they are not that far off track, they are very close to plan,"" Blount said. ""Of course we are having losses in pay TV, that is the business,"" he said.

KevinMorrison,"The success of Australia's film industry, basking in the international spotlight after a spate of worldwide hits, has spurred Hollywood talent scouts to search down under for the next ""Shine"" or ""Babe"".
This has been evident at Sydney's ""Tropfest"" short film festival, which attracted representatives from Hollywood agency William Morris and the Cannes film festival for the first time.
The festival has drawn big-name judges, too. This year's included George Miller, the producer of box-office hit ""Babe"", while actress Nicole Kidman and ""Portrait of a Lady"" director Jane Campion were judges last year.
Oscar-nominated Geoffrey Rush was to attend but went to Los Angeles to collect his Screen Actors' Guild Award for best actor in ""Shine"", said John Polson, Tropfest's founder and director.
Now seen as the nation's premier short-film festival and a talent pool of film-makers, the first Tropfest four years ago saw just 50 film buffs squashed into a Sydney cafe one night to watch their home-made films on a television set.
""Although it started as a bit of a joke, it is seen by many people as a legitimate thing to win,"" Polson said.
""I know many people out there in the commercial (advertising) field, who are just desperate to win Tropfest and get some sort of acclaim from their peers,"" Polson told Reuters.
""Previous winners each year they have gone on to big and better things,"" said Polson, who is also an actor.
Gregor Jordan won the 1995 Tropfest with his film ""Swinger"" and went on to win the Cannes Film Festival jury prize for best short film. Last year's Tropfest winner, Jonathon Ogilvie, was a Cannes finalist with his work ""This Film is a Dog"".
NEARLY 200 ENTRIES
TV stuntman Nat Edgerton won this year's Tropfest with ""Deadline"" over nearly 200 other films, almost double the number entered in 1996. The first Tropfest drew just eight entries.
Because of the increase in films, Polson decided to show them in February and March at cafes on Sydney's cappuccino strip -- Victoria Street -- near the King Cross red light district.
The month-long festival, which ends on March 23, has become big business. This year's festival cost about A$180,000 (US$141,000) -- the first Tropfest cost Polson about A$800.
Tropfest takes its name from the Tropicana Cafe in Victoria Street, seen as a popular hangout for aspiring film-makers. The cafe still has a strong link with the festival, donating a year's supply of coffee to a winner of its own choice.
""I saw it (Tropicana) in those days as the place where people were most guilty of sitting around and talking about movies and not actually out there making them,"" Polson said.
""The festival is about encouraging people to make films, it is not just about screening them. We could be a festival where we just get the best short films from around the world.""
The only criterion for a Tropfest entry is that the film must be seven minutes long and have a pickle in it. Last year it was a teaspoon and the year before that it was a coffee bean.
Tropicana was the sole host of the first two festivals. In its third year the festival crowd took up the whole of Victoria Street, and this year, 13,000 people filled Victoria Street and the local park, where the films were simulcast by satellite.
POPULAR BLEND
Mixing films and coffee has proved a popular blend in Sydney and Polson plans to take this combination to cafes around Australia with the help of satellite technology.
""What I want to do next year is have a link-up with other cafes in capital cities around Australia so that we have a national film festival happening simultaneously,"" Polson said.
The boom in local short-film festivals is attributed both to Australians'love of film viewing and the international success of Australian films.
""I think people are realising that it is just as satisfying, if not more so, to...watch 10 or 12 succinct, strong and well executed ideas as it is to go and watch a feature,"" Polson said.
In recent years, Sydney has hosted the Flickerfest and Metfest festivals, and Melbourne the St Kilda festival.
Ansett Airlines has started begun showing short films on its flights and TV's Seven Network Ltd is about to begin a 30-minute programme of shorts. Both are partly owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who also has 50 percent of Australian pay television network Foxtel, which has the right to show the Tropfest films.

KevinMorrison,"Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd, expected to report a sharp fall in half year profit on Wednesday, is shopping around for a new chief executive just as retailing conditions are expected to turn for the better.
Analysts said Chris Tideman who resigned as CEO on Tuesday was the victim of a weak retail environment at a time when David Jones was spending more on opening new stores and restructuring.
David Jones has disappointed investors since it listed in November 1995 with its failure to match prospectus forecasts.  
""I think the cycle worked against them,"" a Melbourne retailing analyst said.
""They have underperformed the cycle and that is a bit of a shame. That reflects the costs of the new store openings.""
Analysts said Tideman may have been trying to do too much at one time. David Jones was introducing new systems to manage its inventory as well as increasing its range of private label merchandise and restructuring its buying department.
The retailer had also restructured its South Australian operations and announced plans to expand into Western Australia and New Zealand.  
""They have committed themselves to a lot of new stores and so far the new stores they have opened up ... are loss making and they have committed themselves to other new stores so their cost structure is a bit pumped up,"" said Simon Shakesheff a retail analyst at Macquarie Equities.
David Jones' share price has hardly been above its A$2.00 issue price since the float. The group is due to release its results for the 26 weeks to January 25 on Wednesday.
In January, the retailer said it expected its results to be up to 50 percent down on a year ago.  
Tideman cited personal reasons for leaving and the company said he would return to Britain.
Analysts expect David Jones to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$20 million and A$22 million.
The dividend is expected to be about three cents a share for the 1996/97 first half.
David Jones reported a net profit before abnormals of A$44.2 million for the 1995/96 first half and a dividend of six cents a share. Analysts estimate the full 1996/97 year result to be between A$34 million and A$38 million.  
The retailer reported a net profit of A$67.53 million in the 1995/96 year, which was up on the 1995 prospectus forecast of A$64.6 million, but its 1995/96 sales were below forecasts.
Analysts were mixed about the outlook. Some said the new chief had a tough job ahead due to re-invigorated Coles Myer Ltd owned Grace Bros-Myer department stores and the entry into the local market by Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer.
But other analysts said Australia's retail outlook for 1997 had improved and that the restructuring of David Jones was almost complete, meaning the new chief should not have as bumpy a ride as Tideman since he joined the group in 1994.  
""It could be a dream job, coming in at the bottom of the cycle and six months away from full systems implemention,"" said John Burgess, a retail analyst at Pru-Bache Securities.
""We have had two bad Christmases in 1995 and 1996,"" Burgess said. ""You will reach the bottom of the spending cycle in the next two quarters, so you have spending on the rise, albeit slowly, towards the end of 1997,"" he said.
Analysts said David Jones may even announce the new chief executive on Wednesday. Investors reacted positively to Tideman's exit, pushing up the shares by three cents to A$1.74. About 1.21 million shares had traded by 2.15 p.m. (0315 GMT).
"
KevinMorrison,"Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd reported on Wednesday a 50 percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half and said it expected to make the appointment of its new chief executive officer (CEO) soon.
David Jones, which is currently without a chief following the resignation of Chris Tideman on Monday, reported a net profit of A$22.34 million in the 26 weeks ended January 25, compared with a net profit of A$44.64 million a year ago.
The retailer also said the 1996/97 year net profit would be lower than the previous year.  
Chairman Richard Warburton said the retailer would also review five or six of its underperperforming stores, but would not say if that meant store closures, but added that David Jones was also committed to its store expansion programme.
Tideman, who joined the company in 1994, made a surprise resignation on Monday, citing personal reasons.
Responding to reports that there was shareholder pressure on Tideman to resign, Warburton said Tideman left of his own will and that there was no pressure from the board or shareholders.  
Tideman oversaw the refloat of David Jones in November 1995 from the corporate remains of the debt-laden Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd, which cash-starved David Jones for most of the latter part of its 15-year ownership tenure.
""We expect to make an annoucement within days, not weeks,"" Warburton said about the chief executive appointment.
Warburton said the half year results were helped by a good January, but described the result as ""disappointing.""
""February saw a bit of a correction from the January upturn, but we have seen a slight increase in March,"" Warburton said.  
""Over the balance of the year, the company will continue to focus on implementing initiatives in product, consumer service and systems,"" the company said in the results statement.
""However, at this stage it is anticipated that the profit before tax level in the second half will be below the same period last year,"" the company said.
David Jones warned in early January that its first half profit would be up to 50 percent below forecast due to a lacklustre retail trading environment.  
Warburton said today the company did not expect any material improvement in retail trading conditions in the second half, adding that three reductions in official interest rates in 1996 had yet to filter through to the retailing sector.
Finance director Robert Wright said today David Jones' 1996/97 profit would be within analysts forecasts of between A$32 million and A$37 million.
David Jones sales fell one percent to A$782.58 million in the 1996/97 first half.  
Warburton said the retailer would review about five or six of its 30 stores department stores which were underperforming and not returing any shareholder vale.
He said about one-third of David Jones stores were performing very well, another third were making a profit, but could be improved, while the final third were underperforming and not returning any shareholder value.
""You have got a final third that's just not producing shareholder value. They are not necessarily losing money but they are not increasing shareholder value,"" he said.  
""Out of that third a half, I believe, with a bit of hard work and creative juices could take them above the line, the other half we have to look at very, very closely.""
""So you can see we have about five or six stores to look at, that does not necessarily mean closure. It may mean you have to look at different things to do with those stores,"" he said.
At 2.50 p.m. (0350 GMT), David Jones shares were two cents lower at A$1.72 with 487,292 shares traded.

KevinMorrison,"The Australian government appointed stockbrokers on Thursday to manage the proposed sharemarket float of its telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp, which will be the nation's largest privatisation.
The float is estimated to raise a minimum of A$8.0 billion (US$6.32 billion) -- and perhaps much more.
Finance Minister John Fahey said he wanted the Telstra float, through the sale of a third of the government's 100-percent stake, to go through by the end of the year.
""I want it ready to go to the market this year, this calendar year,"" Fahey told reporters.
""But I am not saying it will,"" he said. He added it was unclear whether the float of other international telephone companies would affect the float timing. France Telecom and Italy's state-owned Stet are also planned for sale this year.
Australian brokers J.B Were &amp; Son, U.S.-based CS First Boston and European based ABN AMRO/Rothschild had been appointed global co-ordinators for the float, Fahey said.
He said J.B Were, Ord Minnett of Australia,  CS First Boston, U.S.-Australian consortium Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank, Daiwa of Japan, ABN AMRO/Rothschild and German owned Deutsche Morgan Grenfell were appointed joint lead managers.
The float would not be underwritten in Australia, where 65 percent of the offer is to be sold. But the shares offered in the United States would be underwritten and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the minister said.
Two percent of the offer is set aside for Telstra employees and foreign investors are entitled to 35 percent.
Fahey would not comment on how much the government expects to raise from the partial sale of Telstra. ""I want to get optimum value for taxpayers of Australia,"" Fahey said.
Australia's Liberal-National Party coalition government was elected just over a year ago promsing to sell one-third of Telstra, with A$1.0 billion of the sale proceeds going to set up an environment fund.
The float of Telstra will far exceed other privatisations by the Australian government in recent years. The sale of Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised a total of A$8.0 billion, in two separate tranches, and the 1995 float of Qantas Airways Ltd raised A$1.45 billion.
The announcement was a boon to Australia's stockbroking community whose Christmas bonuses will be swelled by the Telstra float. The bidding for the Telstra deal was contested by 30 broking firms, which were invited to lodge proposals.
However any of the appointed brokers for the managment of the Telstra float would be barred from managing the proposed float of rival telecom group Optus Communications Pty Ltd as it would be a conflict of interest, Fahey said.
""They will not be able to take part in other transactions which the Commonwealth (government) considers to be a conflict of interest and that includes taking part in a public offer of some other telecommunications group,"" Fahey said.
Optus plans a share market float later this year, but the float is held up by court action.

KevinMorrison,"Australian corporate profits, largely in line with expectations in the latest earnings season just finished, are on the mend after 18 months of disappointment, analysts said.
Overall earnings still fell but analysts are optimistic that profits for the year to June 30 should show an overall rise as economic growth gathers pace and commodity prices trend higher. The results also reflected cost cutting, as companies tear into costs to deliver earnings growth in Australia's low inflation environment, analysts said.  
Craig Drummond, head of research at brokers J.B. Were &amp; Son, said earnings per share (EPS) for industrial companies was 1.7 percent up while resource company EPS was down four to five percent.
The drop in resource earnings, due mainly to lower commodity prices and a higher Australian dollar, pulled overall earnings slightly down, Drummond said.
He said this corporate earnings season marked the end of disappointing profits that industrial groups have posted over the past 18 months. He said both industrial and resource profits should rise in the second half of 1996/97 and calendar 1998.  
""The market is not really worried about this half year result and we should start with banks having reasonable results in May,"" Drummond said.
Three of Australia's four largest banks, National Australia Bank Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, are to report their 1996/97 first half results in May.
David Rees, equity strategist at brokers BT Securities: ""I think compared with 12 months ago there have been a lot of signs of improvement. I think compared with what people were expecting, ... it is pretty close to line ball.""  
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, pastoral and energy group Wesfarmers Ltd and retailers Woolworths Ltd and Coles Myer Ltd all reported better-than-expected profits.
""I think what is important for the market is what happens next and our view is that given the evidence of cost cutting and restructuring, given what has happened, we are looking for improvements across a whole range of companies,"" Rees said.
Rees said there should also be earnings improvements coming from the growth in Australia's capital expenditure (capex), which the government expects to be about 17 percent for 1996/97.  
""What we are now looking for is the follow through from capex ... to the bottom line,"" Rees said. Analysts said many companies improved their 1996/97 half profits by cost cutting.
Marcus Tuck, economist at HSBC James Capel, said: ""Generally the cost cutting has been good and you could say that managers are slowly learning to deal with a low inflation environment.""
Australia, which has enjoyed 22 quarters of continuous economic growth, has only seen three quarters with inflation rates above five percent and has had 12 quarters since June 1991 with an inflation rate below two percent.  
With the results season out of the way, investors are currently more concerned about the outlook for U.S. interest rates, said Mark O'Brien, head of equities at Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP).
""The results that have been coming out having been largely in line. Very quickly once they (investors) realised the results weren't going to be disappointing, they turned their attention to U.S. interest rates,"" O'Brien said.

KevinMorrison,"Peace could be about to break out in Australia's pay television war as the industry's biggest investors, telecoms carriers Telstra Corp and Optus Communications Pty Ltd, turn to other battles.
Both face upcoming sharemarket floats and new struggles in a soon-to-be deregulated telephone market.  
Any peace deal could see rationalisation amongst the three main players in Australia's pay-TV industry, Foxtel, Optus Vision and Australis Media Ltd, which between them have racked up losses of nearly A$1.5 billion since 1993, when satellite-TV operator Australis was formed.
The rationalisation may include each pay TV operator sharing cable and satellite facilities and an end to exclusive programming, which are expensive, analysts said.  
""I think if they can rationalise the pay TV industry, it is a positive for everyone. No one is going to lose out,"" one Sydney-based telecommunications analyst said. He added it could swell the market valuations of both Telstra and Optus.
The first signs of peace emerged earlier this month when both Optus and Telstra during the release of their respective profit results for the six months to December 31, 1996 confirmed they were in talks with each other about sharing infrastructure.
""People are in a more conciliatory mood now, than they have been for a long time,"" the telecommunications analyst said.  
Telstra is currently committed to spending about A$4 billion on rolling out its fibre-optic cable network to four million Australian homes, which carries its Foxtel pay TV service, which it jointly owns with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.
Optus Communications' 46.5 percent owned Optus Vision is spending A$3.0 billion on a rival cable network.
The duplication of networks is a concern to Telstra chief executive Frank Blount, who said this month he was talking to Optus about these issues. ""Yes, we are talking about all of our initiativies in the industry,"" Blount told a news conference. The cost of the two networks is making losses until almost next century, both Telstra and Optus have said.
It is these loss-making areas that potential investors are nervous about. They want them fixed before they take a punt on the Telstra and Optus floats, which are both earmarked for 1997.
""Both are to face the rigours of the stockmarket and both of them have to turn around what are big black holes,"" said Bob Peters, media strategist at brokers ANZ Securities.
However, any rationalisation of Australia's pay-TV industry will depend on the outcome of the courtroom drama between Optus Vision shareholders and television broadcaster Seven Network Ltd, which has a two percent holding in Optus Vision.  
Seven, which is 15 percent owned by Murdoch's News Corp, has accused fellow Optus Vision shareholders, Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, telecom group U.S. West Inc and Optus Communications, of breaching an agreement.
If Seven wins the court case it could be entitled to buy Optus Vision at a discount.
The outcome of court action, may be settled outside the courtroom as one of the parties has confirmed to Reuters it is in talks with the other about reaching an agreement.  
This agreement could be the catalyst for the pay-TV industry shake-up and see Optus Communications taking over the Optus Vision network and it would then be able to strike a new deal with Telstra about sharing his other's networks, analysts said.
But any agreement between Telstra and Optus over pay-TV needs the approval of anti-monopolies watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which prevented a merger attempt between Foxtel and Australis last year.
The Seven-Optus Vision courtroom brawl has already stalled the planned float of Optus Communications.  
Telstra's float could be held up if it does not clear up its liability to Foxtel, which is paying A$4.5 billion to Australis for a supply of movies over 25 years, analysts said. The Australian government wants Telstra to float by the end of 1997. The settlement in January between arch rivals Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer over the broadcasting of the Murdoch-backed Super League football competition following a meeting of the two on Murdoch's yacht off New Zealand's Bay of Islands at the end of last year, paves the way for more deals, analysts said.
""The changing relations between Packer and Murdoch may have a lot to do with it as well,"" ANZ's Peters said.  
""It is complicated and it will take a while to resolve, but it is heading in the right direction,"" Peters said.

KevinMorrison,"Qantas Airways Ltd is expected to fly slightly above its prospectus net profit forecast of A$237 million for the year to June 30, 1996 but analysts said 1996/97 results could hit some turbulence over current wage talks.
Australian aviation analysts expect Qantas to report an annual net profit before abnormals of between A$237 million and A$249 million. The airline is expected to pay a second half dividend of 13 cents, making a total of 16.5 for the year.  
Analysts said the Qantas result would be helped by lower costs, on which the airline has focussed since it became a publicly-owned company in July 1995.
""We have got an official figure of A$237 (million), but I really expect it to be around the A$240 to A$245 million mark and that would be largely driven by the cash flow being steered towards paying off debt,"" a Melbourne analyst said.
ANZ McCaughan aviation analyst Yasmin Allen expects Qantas to report a profit of A$237 million for 1995/96. ""I would not be surprised to see it come in above that,"" Allen told Reuters.  
Another Melbourne-based aviation analyst forecast Qantas to report a net profit right on the prospectus forecast of A$237 million while one Sydney-based analyst forecast a net profit before abnormals of A$239.1 million for the year.
""They have done well on the cost reduction side and they have seen the market grow, but they have lost market share, so add all that up and I think they will come out about square,"" the second Melbourne-based analyst said.
Last week the Department of Transport released data showing that Qantas, including wholly-owned Australia Asia Airlines, had a 37.9 percent international market share in April.  
Qantas, which is 25 percent owned by British Airways Plc, forecast in its 1995 prospectus that its international market share would be 41.1 percent for the June 30, 1996 year.
Qantas, known as the 'flying Kangaroo' estimated a one percentage point variation from this forecast would affect the bottom line profit by A$48 million.
However, analysts said they were more interested in comments about Qantas' outlook for the 1996/97 year, as costs may increase, arising from current wage talks, renewed domestic competition, and continued pressure on international routes.  
Qantas has offered an eight percent pay rise over two years over two years on condition that productivity reforms are implemented, but unions want productivity gains to be rewarded by a wage rise over and above the eight percent offer.
Qantas shares took a dive to a record low of A$1.87 on July 24 as the market got the jitters that management had conceded to union pressure and award a wage rise above eight percent.
The unions initially made a claim for two consecutive annual wage rises of 10 percent but last month, Qantas chief executive James Strong said this claim would wipe out the airline's profit if successful.  
Qantas shares have now moved back to familiar territory and on Tuesday were trading at A$2.17.
Analysts expect Qantas to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$260 million to A$273 million for 1996/97, but some analysts said they would be ready to mark down these numbers if there were some very negative comments from Qantas.
They said the planned purchase by Air New Zealand Ltd of a 50 percent stake in local airline Ansett Airlines Ltd may pressure the 1996/97 results  
""People have known what 96 will look like but 97 is going to be a different story for a whole mix of things and there should also be some impact from a combined Ansett/Air New Zealand when that starts to happen later this year,"" the Sydney analyst said.

KevinMorrison,"Muhammad Yunus may have the travel itinerary and packed schedule of an international banker, but that is where the comparisons stop.
He does not wear a banker's pinstripes, but the traditional, billowing Bangladeshi panjami. He eschews five-star hotels and stays instead with friends and supporters around the world.
Yet Yunus is Bangladesh's most successful banker, a man who has gained international renown for doing the unthinkable.
Yunus is head of Grameen Bank, which makes money out of lending money to some of the world's poorest people. Ninety-four percent of Grameen's borrowers are women, and the bank makes loans to people with no collateral or credit rating.
To the traditional banker this may sound like financial suicide, but Grameen has attracted more than two million customers since it started in 1976 and its lending philosophy has spread to over 50 countries.
Yunus, founder and managing director of Grameen Bank, says his strategy works -- 98 percent of loans get repaid, a banker's dream, and most borrowers escape from their poverty trap.
""Our goal is to take the poor people out of poverty as many ways as possible,"" Yunus said during a visit to Australia to meet Grameen supporter groups and politicans.
Some of the world's biggest bankers are now listening to Yunus's cry against poverty. The World Bank has appointed him chairman of its policy advisory group in its lending programmes to the poor.
The world's first Micro-Credit Summit, held last month in Washington, set out to ensure that 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially women, receive credit by the year 2005. A large part of the credit programmes will be based on policies used by the Grameen Bank, which is 92 percent owned by its borrowers. The rest is owned by the Bangladesh government.
The formation two years ago of CGAP (the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest), with the financial backing of the World Bank and European Commission, is an endorsement by the World Bank of Yunus's vision.
The CGAP has a budget of $291 million to set up micro-lending banks around the world. Yunus wants to make sure all of this money reaches the people that need it and that it is not chewed up by bureaucracy.
""We are saying exactly $291 million should reach the hands of the poor people and you make the minimum out of service charges and we are suggesting a mechanism to do that,"" he said.
""Most of the aid money gets dried up in the servicing of the aid. I am not blaming the bureaucracy itself. I am simply saying the design is wrong,"" said the former economics professor.
The world aid system also has its faults, Yunus said in an interview before a public lecture to a packed unversity audience.
If he is not giving lectures in foreign countries he is receiving prizes or honorary degress and meeting supporters.
Each year about $60 billion is given in aid by the World Bank and other government agencies, but these funds fail to meet their market -- the poor, Yunus said.
This aid has been given to large infrastructure projects on the trickle-down economic theory rationale, but these do not create sustainable employment, said the U.S.-educated banker.
Yunus' idea for Grameen Bank came when he returned to newly-independent Bangladesh in 1972 to become head of the economics department at Chittagong University. He found that the theories he was teaching were not working -- just outside the university walls people lived in squalor.
Almost half of Bangladesh's 112 million people live below the poverty line and about 68 percent of the population are illiterate.
The 57-year-old banker knew that poverty was not due to laziness or lack of intelligence but a lack of capital needed for agriculture or industry.
Grameen Bank now has a staff of 12,600 who visit 36,000 of Bangladesh's 68,000 villages each week to meet their 2.1 million customers. In 1996 the bank loaned about $400 million with the average loan at $150. The bank has two loans -- a one-year self employment loan and a 10-year housing loan.
""It (capital) is a very important part of alleviating poverty, but it is not the only one,"" said Yunus, who has been mentioned as a possible future Nobel Peace Prize winner.
""But other pieces become easier to fit in when you have created this centrepiece, then you can add the health piece, you can add education,"" said Yunus, who also plans to provide health care insurance, solar heating and cellular telephone services to Grameen customers.
""Our goal is to get these 2.1 million families out of poverty in the next five years in Bangladesh,"" Yunus said.
""Worldwide we shall look for a day when all the poor people are out of poverty... If it can be done in Bangladesh with 2.1 million families, it can be done worldwide. It is just a question of will.""

KevinMorrison,"The consortium building the Sydney 2000 Olympic stadium on Thursday closed the books on an innovative funding scheme that turned into one of Australia's biggest market flops.
Stadium Australia had hoped to offset some of its A$660 million (US$515 million) construction costs through the sale of 34,400 ""Gold Passes"" giving investors a mixture of Olympic tickets, equity and stadium membership.
But investors and sports fans alike shunned the A$364.4 million (US$286.05 million) offer, leaving underwriters facing a massive funding shortfall.
Analysts and local media put the gap at up to A$240 million, which would make it one of Australia's biggest share flops and mean big losses for the four firms that underwrote the issue.
A spokeswoman for Stadium Australia said it expected to release the results of the float late next week, even though the issue officially closed on Thursday afternoon.
Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) president Michael Knight, who is also Olympics minister in the New South Wales government, agreed on Thursday that the Stadium Australia float likely fell short.
""It is not a direct concern to either the government or to SOCOG, although obviously we would prefer that the stadium float was better subscribed than is apparently the case,"" Knight told reporters.
The disappointment comes hard on the heels of the unexpected departure of SOCOG chief executive Mal Hemmerling, although the issue was unrelated. Hemmerling was replaced by Sandy Hollway, who worked for former prime minister Bob Hawke.
It also follows financial difficulties experienced by the Australian Olympic Committee, which has lost millions of dollars investing in a Queensland casino.
The Stadium Australia offer has been open for almost six months, more than twice as long as most share offers.
Its offer of 34,400 gold packages at A$10,000 each and 600 platinum passes at A$33,000 each opened on October 7, and its closing date has been extended twice due to lack of demand.
The gold packages include a seat at every stadium session of the 2000 Olympic Games, stadium membership for 30 years and 1,000 shares in the stadium company itself. The platinum package includes two priority seats and membership privileges.
Australian stockbrokers said the offer was too expensive given that average income in Australia was only A$36,000.
""Nobody is going to buy just one ticket, with a family you are more likely to buy four, so it's going to cost A$40,000,"" said one Sydney-based broker.
""Not many people can spend that sort of money, particularly if there is no guarantee on what events are going to be held there after the Olympics,"" the broker said.
The four underwriters of the stadium offer are ANZ Securities, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Macquarie Bank Ltd and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
""If there is a shortfall, (and) that appears to be the case, after today they will still have a considerable period of time to trade their way out of trouble,"" Knight said of the four.
The underwriters must fund the project regardless of whether all the packages are sold, thus guaranteeing the completion of the 110,000-seat stadium, which is due to open in 1999 in time for a season of pre-Olympic competitions.
""The money is absolutely guaranteed, the stadium construction is rocketing ahead and will not be affected in any way by the difficulties the underwriters are facing in recouping the money,"" Knight said.
The stadium is being built by a consortium led by private Australian construction group Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd, British investment bank Hambros Plc and Japanese building contractor Obayashi Corp.

KirstinRidley,"Privatisation, the flagship economic policy of Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives, was good to British Telecommunications.
From its menial beginnings as a Post Office appendage, the company has grown meteorically into a formidable, telecoms giant whose network of alliances span most of the globe.
The sale of BT in 1984 began what was dubbed ""the long march of privatisation"" under 18 years of Conservative rule which has been emulated by governments around the world.
The Conservative legacy has transformed British industry and even helped inspire the former communists of eastern Europe.
But this march could come to a shuddering halt following the Labour Party's landslide victory in Britain's May 1 election.
It is not that New Labour, created from the roots of a party that traditionally favoured state ownership, necessarily wants to protect nationalised firms from being pressed by shareholders into delivering efficiencies. It doesn't.
It's just that there is little left to privatise. As one commentator pointed out: ""Most of the family silver is long gone, what remains is little more than the teaspoons.""
Led by former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the government triggered a controversial and comprehensive privatisation programme which raised more than 68 billion pounds ($110.4 billion) for the Treasury's coffers.
Industries from aerospace, airlines, buses, railways, coal, electricity, gas, steel, telecommunications and water went under the hammer.
The former Conservative chancellor (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke says privatised companies now contribute 2.6 billion pounds a year in taxes compared with 37 million when they were in state hands.
""Whether you support privatisation is a litmus test of whether you seriously support free enterprise,"" Clarke said.
BT, MODEL PRIVATISED TELECOMS COMPANY
BT, whose 14.2 billion pound sale 13 years ago was one of the biggest the world had seen, has created a model privatised telecoms company.
In 1984, BT was a true monopoly. It operated its network, supplied the services and telephone equipment and employed 245,000 staff. Quality of service was mixed, waiting times for new lines long and mobile telephony barely existed.
From such an unprepossessing start, a much leaner BT last year launched the biggest transatlantic merger in history, proposing to buy America's second long distance carrier MCI Communications Corp for $20 billion.
Together, BT and MCI will form Concert Plc, a powerful alliance whose empire connects 41 countries.
BT, currently valued at around 28 billion pounds, still dominates the British telecoms market. But it faces increasing competition from 150 rivals in the domestic market and 46 international carriers.
However, some observers say its success owes more to the strategic cunning of its executives and break-neck speed of new technology rather than Conservative party policy.
Others blame an over-hasty privatisation to raise cash for tax cuts for driving the company to seek its global fortune with an American carrier rather than with its British rival, Cable and Wireless Plc.
BT's planned 33 billion pound merger with C&amp;W, which would have brought with it vital access to the lucrative Asian telecoms markets, was abandoned last May -- partly because of concerns that regulators might block the deal.
George Pitcher, chief executive of management consultancy Luther Pendragon, believes corporate liberation in Britain has been simultaneously stifled by heavy-handed and ill-considered regulation.
""BT and Cable and Wireless would have been a huge force and a great opportunity for Britain,"" Pitcher says.
British Gas, which was privatised as a monopoly, has been regulated into break-up and may well be taken over. Eleven of 12 electricity suppliers have snapped up -- seven by U.S. groups keen on their cash-spinning powers.
TV AMBITION'S THWARTED
An unrelenting regulatory rein has also prevented BT from realising another of its ambitions -- turning into a television broadcaster.
The Conservative government banned BT from taking on the mainly American cable TV firms at their own game because it feared they might not survive such a market onslaught.
Consequently, consumers have had to wait years for cable groups to offer TV services which BT, with its established network, could have provided much sooner.
Ironically Labour, which has accused the government of short-changing consumers in its rush to sell state assets, promised to promptly lift the ban if it came to power.
Nevertheless, the early liberalisation of the telecoms industry has created one of the most competitive markets in the world -- and BT is exploiting its lead.
While British regulators might have frowned at a merger between BT and C&amp;W, it was the apparent openness of the British market that paved the way for BT's proposed merger with MCI.
U.S. regulatory clearance for the deal hinges on whether Britain is deemed to be as open to U.S. carriers as America is to British ones. Approval is widely expected by autumn.
With other European telecoms markets only due to be liberalised from next year, no other European carrier was in a position to launch such a deal. ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)

KirstinRidley,"Cable and Wireless Plc, Britain's second biggest telecommunications company, reported record annual results on Wednesday but said it was biding its time before choosing any global partners.
C&amp;W, which confirmed it was still in talks with telecoms alliances such as Global One, said pre-tax profits after exceptional items jumped 12 percent to 1.42 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in the year ended March 31.
But stripping out one-off items, profits were only two to four percent higher than last year, analysts said.
The company, which raised its total dividend 11 percent to 11.1 pence for the year to March 31, said greater demand in its businesses around the world and a management focus on improving productivity had boosted performance.
Group turnover, including C&amp;W's share of associated undertakings, rose 13 percent to just over 7.0 billion pounds. Although underlying profits were in line with expectations, the shares fell 20p to 492.5p.
Analysts were split on why the shares were being marked down. Some cited profit taking and others blamed concerns over C&amp;W's cable venture, uncertainty over its key Hong Kong business and restlessness that the company appeared to be ignoring key European and U.S. markets in its drive for expansion -- at least in the short term.
Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers, remains unperturbed. ""The results were pretty good across the board. There are a lot of one-offs which have to be taken out but at an underlying level, they were at the top half of the range of expectations,"" he said.
C&amp;W's chief executive Richard Brown promised that the company was just beginning to build long-term growth.
""We are seizing opportunities to expand our revenues in fresh, innovative ways,"" said chief executive Richard Brown in the results statement.
The company last month merged its British telephone subsidiary Mercury with three cable television companies to create the country's biggest cable group called Cable and Wireless Communications, which some analysts say will boost the bottom line within a couple of years.
Finance director Robert Lerwill told Reuters that the group continued to talk with suitors such as the Global One alliance of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp.
But he noted: ""There's nothing specific on any conversations with Global One worth commenting on.
""People have been approaching us and are interested in us, which demonstrates our global reach and the appeal we have for many of these global alliances.""
Global One needs access to the British market as well as C&amp;W's key Asian business interests, which boast a nearly 60 percent stake in lucrative Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd .
Hongkong Telecom contributed just over one billion pounds to annual operating profits and 2.67 billion pounds to group turnover.
A partnership with Global One would also allow C&amp;W to tap the key European telecoms markets, such as France and Germany, which are heading for liberalisation next year.
""If we did in some way get associated with another alliance, then (continental) Europe is the place where there is more to go for,"" Lerwill said.
C&amp;W, which says it will use Cable and Wireless Communications as its springboard for European expansion, has limited access to that continent since pulling out of its German alliance with VEBA AG in February.
One question mark which hangs over C&amp;W is its holding in Hongkong Telecom. With only weeks to go before the British colony reverts to Chinese control, speculation has been sparked that China may pressure C&amp;W into reducing its majority stake.
But C&amp;W insists there is no requirement for it do so. Instead, it welcomed more direct Chinese involvement in Hongkong Telecom last week, seeing it as a sign that the Chinese are likely to use the company as their principal telecoms partner in Hong Kong.
China Everbright, which reports to China's State Council (cabinet), bought a 7.7 percent stake in the Hong Kong company from CITIC Pacific, which is seen by analysts to be more independent.
Some analysts expect further Chinese investment in Hongkong Telecom, combined with new growth opportunities for the Hong Kong firm on the Chinese mainland.
But Adrian Goodall, telecoms analyst at SBC Warburg, said: ""The potential for growth in China is indisputable, although the ability to make attractive returns from investment in that growth may be a tough proposition.""

KirstinRidley,"British Telecommunications Plc flexed its muscles on Thursday, saying it would not hesitate to launch a legal challenge to any government windfall tax on its profits.
Reporting a rise in annual pretax profits to 3.2 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) from 3.02 billion, chairman Sir Iain Vallance said the group owed it to its investors to attempt to fight any Labour plans to tax its earnings.
""If we are stung in a big way for this tax and if it can be challenged legally, we owe it to our shareholders to challenge it,"" Vallance told BBC radio.
But he added the company would be ""very sad"" to start a partnership with Labour, which swept to power on May 1 for the first time in 18 years, on such a footing.
""I would not have voted Labour had (a windfall tax on BT) been in the manifesto,"" Vallance told reporters.
The government says it will levy a one-off tax on what it calls the ""excess profits"" of privatised utilities, whose large executive salaries and surging dividend payments to shareholders have enraged consumer groups.
Labour, which wants to raise money to help get the young and long-term unemployed back to work, declines to identify the firms it plans to target and BT's comments found favour with another potential target -- BAA.
The British airports operator is taking legal advice and accused Labour of ""verging on irresponsibility"" by not detailing who would be hit.
Unlike water and electricity companies, which are resigned to the tax, BT's Vallance charged that it would be ""perverse"" to line up BT with utilities for punishment.
""We're not a monopoly, not a utility, heavily regulated, have very low call charges, an excellent customer service record, we're very important for the UK in getting jobs in the information society that we're in at the moment and therefore why tax us?"" he asked.
But he said BT would not pull out of its ""superhighway"" agreement with Labour, whereby it will wire up for free schools and hospitals. It is hoping for an early release from a ban on using its main network for broadcasting.
While BT was in a fighting mood, it also threw a challenge to its industry regulator Oftel. BT accuses Oftel of suggesting ""unduly harsh"" curbs on the prices BT charges rivals for carrying calls on its network.
Oftel has published a consultation paper suggesting that a basket of so-called ""interconnect"" prices should fall between 6-12 percent below the rate of inflation.
But finance director Robert Brace told reporters that even the lower end of this range was too harsh -- on top of a one-off price cut of 10-20 percent -- and would harm infrastructure investment in Britain.
""In extremis, we would be prepared to challenge it (the price regime) at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,"" he said, adding that interconnect charges in Britain were about one third of those in other countries.
Thursday's results from BT, which left its shares barely changed at 450.5p, are likely to be its last in its current form.
Once its ambitious $20 billion merger with its American partner MCI Communications Corp is cleared by U.S. regulators, a new company called Concert Plc, will be floated in London and New York.
BT on Wednesday won approval from European regulators for what is the biggest transatlantic merger in history.
With final approval expected in autumn, Concert will be the second biggest company in terms market value on the London stock exchange.
Andrew Harrington, analyst at Salomon Brothers, says Concert appears to be the best positioned global carrier in a rapidly consolidating telecoms industry.
But he warns that 50 percent of BT's revenues and 66 percent of its profits depend on an increasingly competitive domestic business.
BT, which raised total dividends 6.l percent to 19.85p, said despite fierce price wars it was increasing its domestic market share amid a strong growth in demand for its products and services.
But price cuts in the year came to 840 million pounds -- nearly six percent of its 14.9 billion pound turnover.
BT maintained its inland call volume growth at seven percent although annual international call volume growth slipped a touch -- also to seven percent.
A strengthening pound also hit BT's international call sales. Together with a 14 percent price cut in the year, international turnover fell 8.6 percent, BT said. ($ = 0.608 British Pounds)
"
KirstinRidley,"British Telecommunications Plc said on Thursday it might launch a legal challenge if a windfall tax on its profits was imposed by Britain's new Labour government.
Reporting a rise in annual pretax profits to 3.2 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) from 3.02 billion, chairman Sir Iain Vallance said the group owed it to its shareholders to try and prevent the government taxing its earnings. BT shares were up two pence at 1120 GMT to 451-1/2p.
""If we are stung in a big way for this tax and if it can be challenged legally, we owe it to our shareholders to challenge it,"" Vallance told BBC radio.
But he added the company would be ""very sad"" to start a partnership with Labour, elected on May 1, on such a footing.
The government said it would impose a one-off windfall tax on what it calls the ""excess profits"" of privatised utilities, whose large executive salaries and surging dividend payments to shareholders have enraged consumer groups into alleging consumers have been short-changed.
Labour has declined to identify the companies it plans to target. But some analysts said BT could be hit with a one-off tax of 1.0-1.5 billion pounds.
Vallance said it would be ""perverse"" to line up BT with privatised utilities, which include many electricity and water companies, for punishment. But he said BT would not pull out of its ""superhighway"" agreement, whereby it would provide free computer services to schools and hospitals in return for an early release from a ban on using its main network for broadcasting.
""We're not a monopoly, not a utility, heavily regulated, have very low call charges, an excellent customer service record, we're very important for the UK in getting jobs in the information society that we're in at the moment and therefore why tax us?"" he asked.
From its menial beginnings as a Post Office appendage, BT has grown meteorically into a formidable telecoms giant whose network of alliances span most of the globe.
BT on Wednesday won approval from European regulators for its proposed merger with its American partner MCI Communications Corp -- the biggest transatlantic merger in history.
The $20 billion deal will create a new company called Concert Plc and only faces one more hurdle -- U.S. regulators. Approval is expected by the autumn.
Finance director Robert Brace told Reuters that BT and MCI's Concert Communications, which provides innovative global services to high-margin, multinational clients, was set to break even this financial year.
He said the business was ""clearly"" ahead of its two loss-making rivals, the Global One partnership between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp and the Unisource/World Partners alliances headed by America's AT&amp;T Corp.
""We've got a backlog of orders of $1.5 billion, the customers love it, it's growing fast,"" he said. ""It's the start of big improved services for multinationals around the world...""
Concert, whose last gap in its geographical coverage remains Asia, boasts business from around 3,500 customers in 41 countries with annual revenues of around $500 million.
Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers, said Concert appeared to be the best positioned global carrier in a rapidly consolidating global telecoms industry.
But he warned that 50 percent of BT's revenues and 66 percent of its profits depended on its domestic business.
BT, which raised total dividends 6.l percent to 19.85p, said despite fierce price competition, it was increasing its market share in Britain amid a strong growth in demand for its products and services, while keeping a tight control on prices.
But inland telephone call turnover was virtually unchanged at 4.874 billion pounds.
BT said price cuts in the year amounted to more than 800 million pounds -- nearly six percent of its 14.9 billion pound turnover.
A strengthening pound also hit BT's international call sales. Together with a 14 percent price cut in the year, international turnover fell 8.6 percent, BT said. ($ = 0.608 British Pounds)

KirstinRidley,"British broadcaster Carlton Communications Plc on Wednesday reported an 11 percent rise in half-year earnings helped by a strong growth in advertising revenue.
Carlton, which operates ITV commercial television licences for London weekday TV, the English Midlands and the west of England, raised pre-tax profits to 158.6 million pounds ($262.5 million) from 143.3 million after a one-off loss of around 4.0 million pounds.
Lifting half-year dividend by 12 percent to 4.9 pence and sending the company's shares jumping, chairman Michael Green pledged that the group would continue to invest in businesses -- and boost prospects.
""We have maintained our clear focus, built up our market leading positions and enhanced both our profitability and our prospects for future growth,"" he said in the results statement.
""We will continue to build on this approach and make sure Carlton makes the best of its excellent prospects.""
The results helped restore some enthusiasm in Carlton's shares, which have been underperforming the market by around 15 percent in the last three months. By mid-morning, the stock leapt 18.5 pence to 517.5p.
Carlton, whose library boasts over 7,500 hours of TV programmes including almost 1,000 films, said its core broadcast business was one of the main drivers behind profits, seeing a 19 percent rise on the operating level to 72.6 million pounds.
An 11 percent rise in advertising revenues, higher programme sales and a 5.2 million pound trading contribution from newly acquired businesses such as Westcountry TV helped boost earnings.
Robert Jolliffe, media analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, is forecasting unchanged full-year pretax profits of 343 million pounds and said the performance of some of Carlton's divisions -- such as its products arm -- had been ""extraordinarily strong"" at the half-way stage.
""Carlton airtime sales continue to dominate ITV. They've seen good market share gains and a strong London market -- so they've done very well in the first half,"" he added.
Carlton's share of ITV's advertising revenue edged up to 32.58 percent from 31.75 percent while telecoms, financial services and airline groups raised advertising spend in a battle to win new clients and keep old ones.
But some brokers, such as BZW, are warning that the advertising revenue outlook over the next four to five years in Britain should be questioned against a background of increasing competition, analysts say.
Another highlight in Carlton's results was its fast-growing Quantel division, which designs and manufactures tapeless editing and broadcasting systems for the film and television industry worldwide.
Operating profits leapt 28 percent to 26.2 million pounds, fulfilling expectations of rapid growth. Some analysts expect new product launches to feed through into the bottom line in the next 12-18 months.
But Carlton's video division cast a pall over results, with operating profits slipping to 36.2 million pounds on 12 percent lower turnover of 242.4 million.
Chairman Green blamed the slow start to the year on the timing of releases and variations in the mix of the business, but added that he was optimistic about making progress in the second half.
Analysts are awaiting news on whether Carlton and its partners in British Digital Broadcasting (BDB) have been awarded key digital terrestrial TV licences in Britain.
Carlton in January joined rival TV giant Granada Group Plc and Rupert Murdoch's dominant pay-per-view broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc to form the formidable BDB.
BDB wants to offer some 15 subscription channels. The group faces competition from Digital Television Network (DTN), owned by Nasdaq-listed NTL Inc -- but in what has been dubbed a classic case of David versus Goliath, most analysts tip BDB as the winner.
Carlton, which has a cash pile of 166 million pounds, said it expected the Independent Television Commission watchdog to award the licence by the end of June.
""Digital terrestrial television brings enormous opportunities to Carlton,"" Green stated.

KirstinRidley,"One 2 One, the British mobile telephone company jointly-owned by Cable and Wireless Plc and U S West Inc, said on Thursday that it was not in talks about joining Cable and Wireless Communications.
Analysts have speculated that the digital cellular company may join CWC, Britain's biggest telephone and television cable company formed by the merger of C&amp;W's Mercury 'phone unit with the three British cable divisions of NYNEX Corp, Bell Cablemedia Plc.
Such a deal would involve U S West selling its 50 percent stake in One 2 One, because the U.S. company is also a major shareholder in CWC's main cable rival -- Telewest Communications Plc.
But One 2 One's managing director Jan Peters told reporters at a business briefing: ""There are no plans to do that and no negotiations to do that.""
Peters said both investors were ""very committed"" to One 2 One, adding that the cellular company could reap synergies from striking distribution, marketing and packaging deals with both CWC and Telewest, which would not involve any structural changes to the companies.
Other future joint deals might also involve CWC or Telewest buying airtime from One 2 One and using it for their own packages and brands.
""We're working with both of them, looking at the options,"" Peters said.
One 2 One -- which has shown marked recovery from a lack of network coverage and what critics described as poor marketing -- was unveiling four, new customer packages designed to expand its business by broadening its appeal.
Available from June 3, the new ""time plan"" deals -- called One 2 Weekend, One 2 30, One 2 100 and One 2 200 -- offer either up to 200 minutes of free voice, fax or data calls nationally or unlimited free weekend local calls.
Monthly service charges from 17.50 stg for One 2 Weekend to 40 stg for One 2 200 compare favourably with similar packages offered by rivals Cellnet Orange Plc and Vodafone Group Plc.
But Peters said the new launches were not part of a new price war in an increasingly competitive market, but rather a move to improve packaging to reduce customer confusion amid a myriad of different package offerings.
One 2 One, one of Britain's newest cellular operators that was launched in September 1993, has won 620,000 customers and captured around 8.8 percent of the national mobile market.
The company, which has doubled year-on-year growth and revenues, said key annualised revenues per subscriber were tracking rivals at around 420 stg compared to Orange's 442 stg, Cellnet's 474 stg and Vodafone's 542.
Total capital expenditure of 970 million stg is planned to March 1998 and national coverage should be boosted from a current 85 percent to 95 percent of the population by the end of this year.
One 2 One's losses widenden to 276 million stg last year as it rolled out its network. But the company said it was on track to break-even on the operating cash level in 1998.

KirstinRidley,"Vodafone Group, Britain's biggest mobile telephone group, raised headline annual profits by 13.5 percent on Tuesday and said it was plotting to overhaul its distribution strategy to kick-start sluggish market growth.
Vodafone, which boasts more than four million customers worldwide, lifted pre-tax profits to 539 million pounds ($880.8 million) -- the top-end of analyst expectations -- including gains from disposals.
Turnover grew 25 percent to 1.749 billion pounds and dividends rose 20 percent to 4.81p.
A maiden operating profit from its international operations of 10.5 million pounds helped boost profits and analysts expect overseas investments to take up the reins of future group earnings amid increasing competition and price cuts at home.
Vodafone's chief executive Chris Gent told Reuters in an interview that subscriber growth in Britian was likely to continue to slow this year -- and Vodafone might cut tariffs next year to help attract new customers.
Vodafone last reduced tariffs around two years ago. But since then, its biggest purely digital rival -- Orange Plc -- has rolled out its network and the smallest operator in Britain, One 2 One, will also soon have a national network.
""I can see it (price cuts) happening again in the summer or autumn of 1998,"" Gent said.
Vodafone also plans to unveil new distribution plans next month, including rationalising its 12 brands under one or two names and introducing a unified billing system to help win fresh subscribers, Gent told Reuters.
One 2 One, jointly owned by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc and U S West Inc, highlighted cut-throat competition in the market by repackaging tariffs last month -- and prompted concerns that Britain is ripe for a rash of price cuts.
Mobile telephone penetration is currently stuck around 13 percent in Britain, compared to around five percent in France, 7.5 percent in Germany and the Netherlands -- and a hefty 29 percent in Sweden.
Gent, who is hoping that British penetration will rise to 15 percent next year, expects the group to win only 350,000 to 400,000 net new subscribers this year, a touch lower than last year's 415,000 level.
""I suspect this year will be similar to last year -- perhaps a little bit down but not much,"" he said, adding: ""I believe we'll see accelerated growth in the UK once we get beyond 15 percent penetration.""
Last year already saw subscriber growth levels fall  34 percent from 1995/96 levels. Analysts note that Finland, which has almost three times the British penetration levels, is growing faster in a quarter than Britain did in the whole of last year.
But broker SBC Warburg adds: ""In our view, renewed growth is a question of 'when' rather than 'if'.""
Gent puts down unenthusiastic growth to fewer incentives to win customers and a high level of churn -- when subscribers end contracts -- while customers migrate from its older analogue network to its digital services.
Vodafone has around 1.3 million customers on its analogue network and some 1.6 million digital subscribers.
The company saw its market share slip 1.5 percent to 40 percent and the key average revenue per subscriber figure -- the amount of profit the company makes on each of its customers -- fell to 427 pounds from 481 pounds.
Vodafone is now growing faster internationally than in Britain and Gent expects 650,000 new customers to take up its international affiliates' services this year.
Brokers Lehman Brothers expects overseas interests to contribute 279 million pounds by 1999/2000 -- and analysts expect Vodafone's shares, trading unchanged at 271.5p on Tuesday -- to start reflecting this value over the next nine months.
Although Vodafone said it was not actively seeking new licences, it will consider acquisition opportunities.
The company said it was ""very likely"" to exercise its option to raise its holding in SFR, France's second network operator, to 20 percent this year. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)

KirstinRidley,"Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc surged on Friday on market hopes that Britain's second biggest telecoms company was poised to seal a deal with China, ending some uncertainty over the future of its biggest asset -- Hong Kong Telecom.
The stock jumped 26.5p to 524p by 1130 GMT after Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd announced that C&amp;W was in discussions with China on future cooperation.
""We understand that these discussions are continuing but there is no certainty as to how and when these will be concluded or as to their effect in relation to Hong Kong Telecom,"" the company said in a statement.
C&amp;W, which declined to comment further, has said it has been in talks with China for some time. But the statement fuelled market hopes that a deal was imminent.
With Hong Kong reverting to Chinese rule at midnight in just 24 days, analysts expect C&amp;W to be encouraged to reduce its near 59 percent stake in the main telephone service provider on the island -- in return for growth opportunities on the booming Chinese mainland.
A sharp rise in Hong Kong Telecom's (HKT) shares to a new year high of HK$19.25 also assumes significant mainland Chinese access, analysts say.
However, some experts say that although the potential for growth in China is indisputable, the ability to make attractive returns from investments in that growth remains unproven.
But with a deal widely expected, analysts are now focusing on how big a stake C&amp;W would sell, at what discount, whether the Chinese would offer an asset swap -- or if C&amp;W gets cash, how it would match the hefty returns HKT used to generate when reinvesting disposal proceeds.
""There could be a scenario whereby Hong Kong Telecom just swaps some assets with the Chinese...in return for a certain percentage in HKT which would solve the Chinese cash burden,"" said one analyst, who declined to be named. ""They have to lay a lot of lines over the next couple of years. Then it's a question of what the Chinese are going to give up? You're not going to be running the Beijing telephone company,"" he added.
China has already secured a 7.74 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecom at a 15 percent discount via a company called China Everbright Group, which is directly under the supervision of China's State Council.
""Holdings in other British-controlled Hong Kong companies have in the past been sold to the Chinese at substantial share price discounts,"" notes C&amp;W's brokers, ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
But it adds: ""A deal in Hong Kong would reinforce the bull case for C&amp;W by removing uncertainty over prospects, while underpinning sum of the parts valuations of the company, which suggests that the shares are worth around 650p.""
Few analysts believe C&amp;W will want to lose majority control of HKT, which contributes 65-70 percent of its profits and offers a robust return on equity of 49 percent, according to Reuters Security 3000 data.
But some say the British company may have to reach a compromise with China, albeit ""kicking and screaming"".
Nevertheless, a sale could leave C&amp;W with 1.0 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) or more to invest.
Deals tipped by experts include a share buy-back or special dividend at both C&amp;W and HKT, buying the remaining 50 percent in C&amp;W's mobile venture One2One from its joint-owner, U S West Inc, or telecoms investments in the Chinese mainland. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

KirstinRidley,"Psion Plc, the British hand-held computer company, saw its shares plummet by almost one fifth on Monday as a slowdown in sales overshadowed the launch of a key new product it said was ""light years"" ahead of its rivals.
The shares dived to close at to 407.5p, a loss of 97.5p or 19.2 percent, having hit an earlier low of 400p. Some analysts said the stock, which was also hit by concerns over the continued strength of sterling, could fall to as little as 350p over the next six months.
Psion, which launched the first handheld Organiser 13 years ago, said its new chequebook-sized Series 5 product was the first fully-functional, pen-orientated, portable computer that fits into a hand -- driving palmtop computing into the 21st Century.
But chairman David Potter conceded that the group's performance would be affected until the new 32-bit computers had become established.
The statement was interpreted by some analysts as a potential profit warning.
""It's not inconceivable that Psion could earn less profit this year than last year,"" warned Keith Woolcock, analyst at brokers Merrill Lynch.
The strength of sterling had knocked about three percentage points off gross margins and with the promise of a new product, sales of older computers had turned sluggish as customers held out for the new machines, analysts noted.
""The new machines will not be in a position to be sold in volumes before the autumn -- so Psion is going to have a big problem,"" Woolcock noted.
The problem Psion faces is a familiar one.
The company saw its profits fall in 1984, before it was floated, when it launched its Organiser and struggled to switch from one big selling product to another.
But Woolcock said that while over-optimism ahead of the launch may have driven shares up too high, in terms of sophistication, the new computer was not in the same ""corner of the universe"" as those of its competitors.
While rivals such as Microsoft Corp were introducing chaos into Psion's market, such a computer giant would only become a serious threat in one or two years, he added.
""The upside is that Psion can come through this,"" Woolcock said. ""We know that they now have some new partners...they have a great product, a good brand name and if Psion can position itself as an antidote to the blandness which Microsoft's products seem to represent -- it's got a great future,"" he said.
Psion, which said it was initially selling 10,000 of the new computers each month, hopes to boost sales to nearly 40,000 by September or October.
Potter told reporters in a telephone conference call that the new computer, which is compatible with Microsoft office products, Lotus Smartsuite and Corel/Wordperfect, was expected to account for nearly 40-50 percent of annual turnover by next year.
Two models in the Series 5 range -- the 8MB and the 4MB, which are being retailed at 499.95 pounds ($817) and 439.95 pounds respectively -- will be available in 50 countries and eight languages. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)

KirstinRidley,"A tough price review of British Gas Plc by industry regulator Clare Spottiswoode has heralded a new era for Britain's utility watchdogs as they at last show their teeth, analysts said on Wednesday.
Sector watchdogs have borne the brunt of derision and mockery over several years while lucrative utility companies' shares surged, apparently unruffled by regulatory price curbs.
Last March, electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild was even forced to reopen a price review on the 12 cash-rich electricity companies, having been embarrassed by the firms' largesse to their investors as they fended off hostile bids.
""It does look like regulators aren't going to have the wool pulled over their eyes any longer,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
""They're quite astute these days and they are getting pretty wise to these companies.""
Consumers, regulators say, will now feel more of the benefits of the controversial privatisation of Britain's gas, water and electricity industries.
Spottiswoode went some way on Wednesday towards meeting British Gas's objections to her earlier proposal of a maximum 28 percent cut in the prices charged by TransCo, the British Gas pipeline subsidiary, when she suggested a 20 percent one-off reduction in its charges.
But analysts said Spottiswoode had already set a new agenda with her initial proposals in May that sent gas shares plunging.
Two subsequent reviews by the power watchdog on Northern Ireland Electricity and National Grid, the power transmission network, have mirrored her unrelenting stance.
""I see May 13 as being a landmark date in terms of regulation,"" said Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Yamaichi.
""That day we saw the first regulator being fairly savage on a company and, above all, actually saying that if you're heavily cash-negative from year to year -- so be it.""
Despite British Gas's continued insistence that the planned Transco price curbs could cost the group 10,000 jobs, Spottiswoode's final proposals do show that there is scope during the consultation period to moderate positions.
Consumers will nevertheless see gas bills fall by 30 pounds ($46.44) next year, rising to 50 pounds in 2001.
There has also already been a 50 pound reduction in bills this year when electricity companies passed on to consumers the money they received from the sale of their National Grid shares.
To the outrage of British Gas, Spottiswoode initially proposed a one-off cut of 20-28 percent followed by annual price reductions at a rate of five percent below inflation per year.
She now wants Transco to cut prices by only 2.5 percent annually after the first big chop. Some analysts see the group's revenues being reined in by about 400 million pounds per year.
""She's been more lenient than some had expected, but I still think it's a very tough review,"" noted one analyst.
Littlechild is proposing cutting the Grid's prices by between 20 and 26 percent next year, followed by a cut in annual prices of four percentage points below inflation.
His final proposals will be published in September and until then, the company will be locked in last-minute battles with its regulator.
The Grid may see its revenues slashed by about 1.2 billion pounds over four years. But with transmission costs only accounting for seven percent of bills, electricity consumers may get between four and five pounds off annual bills.
Northern Ireland Electricity will see 60 million pounds wiped from its revenues. Average household power bills will fall by about 40 pounds in Northern Ireland.
Despite the concessions, British Gas still strongly opposes the way its regulator has written down the value of TransCo.
So the prospect of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation may still loom. ($1=.6460 Pound)

KirstinRidley,"Urgent calls for a global regulatory framework to help combat the risk of crime in the borderless world of the Internet computer network were stepped up on Wednesday by a high-level think tank.
The Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation (CSFI) said that without effective regulation, the Internet could generate a wave of financial scandals, undermine national regulation of financial markets and leave consumers without effective protection.
But in what it called the most comprehensive study make on the potential impact of the Internet on the financial services industry, the Finance Ministry and Bank of England-backed CSFI said the Internet also offered vast opportunities to financial services.
The computer network offered an ""intensely low-cost distribution medium"" -- up to 10 times lower than others -- CSFI director Andrew Hilton told Reuters television.
The CSFI also warned against paranoia, noting that objective information about crime in cyberspace was still scarce.
The extensive use of cryptography -- encoding data, establishing its authenticity and preventing its undetected modification and unauthorised use -- also meant business in cyberspace was more secure than giving a credit card number to a store over the telephone.
The CSFI also suggested a ""kitemark"" to identify regulated firms on the Internet, a greater use of ""firewalls"" or ""sheep dips"" -- anti virus programmes for automatically blocking intruders and for seeking out those who have gained access to unauthorised data -- and tighter security procedures imposed on staff.
""The biggest vulnerability of all is negligence,"" the report said.  But without the proper infrastructure, financial services over the Internet could fizzle out.
Hilton conceded that banks, brokers and even exchanges could go out of business as new players emerged with no ""legacy"" costs sunk in bricks and mortar.
But he added: ""It could happen. But I think it would be wrong to say it will happen because many of these institutions will also be the beneficiaries of the Internet.
""They are quick, they can adapt and effectively dominate this new medium. But they do have legacy systems and these are costs they are carrying that a new entrant might not have,"" he said.
But with the prospect of a global market, the concepts of local regulation might also quickly become outmoded -- as might the notion of a service being provided from one place.
""The movement towards a global marketplace would logically point to a movement to global regulation,"" said Andrew Large, the chairman of Britain's top financial watchdog the Securities and Investment Board, in a foreword to the report.
""Whether, or how quickly, this might happen is not clear,"" he added.
Regulators could attempt the difficult task of  maintaining local jurisdictional control by imposing requirements focing firms to limit access to Web sites.
They could also recognise standards of regulation which allow authorised financial services firms to offer services in any other jurisdiction, Large suggested.
The report, the product of eight working groups of over 120 people from 70 institutions, said that traditional financial service providers, particularly banks, could play a major role in promoting consumer confidence in the Internet.
Insitutions are the service providers and are in a position to supply the payments infrastructure for electronic commerce and underpin its credibility.
""For financial service companies, the Internet poses a threat, but also a major new business opportunity,"" the CSFI said.
"
KirstinRidley,"A plan by disgruntled French luxury goods group LVMH to spin off the brewing, food and burger businesses in a planned merger between Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc is winning some analysts' sympathy.
But Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, smarting from having been sidelined in a proposed 23.8 billion pound ($39.2 billion) merger despite his 14.2 percent Guinness stake, has taken the market by surprise.
In two share raids he has snapped up a 6.29 percent stake in GrandMet and spent around 800 million pounds in an effort to leverage a better negotiating position, analysts said on Friday.
He is now the largest shareholder in both of the hopeful merger partners.
A merger between the two British giants to form a new group called GMG Brands brings together an empire stretching from Johnnie Walker and Bell's whisky, Gordon's Gin, Smirnoff Vodka, and Guinness' traditional stount to the Burger King fast food chain, Haagen Dazs ice-cream and Green giant canned vegetables.
Despite some concerns that a hurried sale of unrelated businesses might not get the best or prices, most analysts expect GMG Brands to eventually spin off at least Burger King -- which one said stuck out like a ""sore thumb"".
""The fact is GrandMet has a spirits and food business together and there isn't any clear logical fit,"" noted one analyst, who declined to be named. ""So perhaps on that basis it would seem sensible to spin it off.""
Analysts said the added value in the planned merger, which is awaiting European and U.S. regulatory clearance, was clearly in the spirits division.
But the food businesses are also more than mere chicken feed. Excluding Burger King, they could be worth 5.0-6.0 billion pounds -- on conservative estimates, some said. And that cash could be spent in emerging markets in an earnings enhancing way.
""I think there is added value putting the sprits divisions together,"" noted another analyst. ""By spinning off the other pieces, LVMH...wants to capture as much of that extra value for its own shareholders as it possibly can.""
Separately, credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's  on Friday placed its 'A-1'-plus commercial paper rating of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) on CreditWatch with negative implications following announcement of LVMH's increased stake in GrandMet and its intention to exercise its option to purchase the 34 percent stake in Moet Hennessy owned by Guinness PLC.
S&amp;P said the acquisitions would place further pressure on the French company's existing financial profile, which had already been stretched in 1996 by the purchase of a 61 percent stake in Duty Free Shopping.
It said the move also reflected uncertainties regarding the possibility that LVMH may further increase its stake in GrandMet to obtain a blocking position regarding the proposed Guinness merger.
While Arnault piles up his bargaining chips amid mounting speculation that he may raise his GrandMet stake to 10 percent, U.S. competition authorities requested more information on the planned merger.
The European Commission, which has until 2200 GMT to decide whether to conduct a second-stage probe, is expected to follow suit.
In the meantime, Arnault can convene an extraordinary general meeting if he raises his stake to 10 percent, and put his views to shareholders and the board.
But in order to block the bid, he needs more than 24 percent of GrandMet shares.
While analysts and the companies are braced for LVMH's next move, few believe it realistic to expect the French company to buy such a large stake despite its threats. Such a move would push the price up too high, only to fall back significantly once the bid was blocked, they said.
""I don't think that's a viable strategy,"" noted one.
While GrandMet was holed up in a meeting and unavailable to comment, Guinness said only that as far as it was concerned, it was pressing ahead with the merger.
""We are confident it will go through at the end of the year and we're watching the developments with interest,"" a company spokesman said.
By 1210 GMT, GrandMet shares were trading at 598p, a loss of 5-1/2p, while Guinness stock slipped 6-1/2p to 598-1/2p.

KirstinRidley,"Mounting concerns about the loss of both two top executives and an equity stake in terrestrial digital TV sent shares in pay-television giant BSkyB diving further on Monday and analysts forecasts more weakness to come.
Around 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) has been wiped off the value of British Sky Broadcasting since last week and some analysts said the shares, which fell 14.5p to 483p in afternoon trade, could tumble to 350p. News Corp Ltd is the largest shareholder in BSkyB.
""There has quite clearly been a re-rating in the last week and I think it's going to continue,"" said Jason Crisp, media analyst at brokers SocGen.
Another broker said only in ""wildly optimistic"" cases could the shares be valued even at 450p.
Negative weekend newspaper reports helped compound last week's share falls sparked by a report in the Financial Times that BSkyB could be shut out of the bidding for new digital TV licences, experts said.
The Financial Times reported last week the television watchdog, the Independent Television Commission, had told BSkyB it should drop its one-third stake in a consortium with commercial TV groups Carlton Communications and Granada Group.
BSkyB was enjoying an effective monopoly on pay- television and the watchdog was concerned about market domination, the FT said.
The report, which remains unconfirmed, followed last week's announcement that BSkyB's respected chief executive Sam Chisolm was stepping down and deputy managing director David Chance was becoming a consultant.
SocGen's Crisp said the stock, which had hit an intraday 1997 high of 669p on February 14, had been vastly over-rated and should be trading nearer 400p.
He noted apart from the possible loss of its equity stake in its digital terrestrial TV consortium, called British Digital Broadcasting, and the loss of two very talented and experienced staff, flat satellite dish sales and rising operating costs were hitting the shares.
""All these things make you think it should be on a more typical PE (price earnings ratio) multiple of other big media companies,"" he added.
At 400p, the stock would have a more reasonable PE of 22 times next year, compared to one nearer 30 times before the share correction, Tysoe said.
Credit Suisse First Boston was even more negative. ""We'd just re-iterate from our call last week that fundamental value on BSkyB is about 450p even in wildly optimistic cases, about 350-400p in more reasoned scenarios,"" it stated in a note.
But Mike Woodcock, media analyst at Nikko, said the share price fall had been overdone and he would recommend buying the shares under five pounds.
He said that in the short-term, the news on BDB, a business he valued at around 400 million pounds, was positive from a financial point of view.
Compensation is tipped by the Financial Times at 75 million pounds. BSkyB can also keep some 100 million pounds which it was going to invest in the joint venture.
""Is the news of BDB and Sam Chisolm stepping down enough to warrant 1.7 billion pounds being wiped from the value of BSkyB? I would say no,"" Woodcock said. ""The real benefits for BSkyB are in the provision of programming rather than in the equity stake.""
But he said as traditionally high operating margins were squeezed -- partly because payments to show English Premier League soccer are set to rise to 160 million pounds per year from August -- he was expecting flat pre-tax profits of 309 million pounds in 1998 and 1997.
Other longer-term concerns, he said, were about how independent BSkyB was from media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, its leading shareholder -- and how much News Corp would benefit from the success of the pay-television giant.
The ITC hopes to decide by the end of this month on whether to award digital terrestrial television licences to BDB or a rival consortium run by cable and broadcast group NTL Inc.

KirstinRidley,"B.A.T Industries Plc said on Monday that its U.S. subsidiary would pay $1.7 billion as its share of a downpayment on a landmark deal between the tobacco industry, legislators and public health authorities.
Amid concern that thorough scrutiny awaits a  controversial U.S. proposal under which tobacco groups could pay $358 billion over 25 years, B.A.T said it might withdraw its support for the deal if it were significantly changed during the legislative process.
B.A.T, whose Brown &amp; Williamson (B&amp;W) unit is the third largest cigarette-maker in the U.S. with brands such as Kent and Lucky Strike, saw its shares slump to close 22.5p weaker at 566.5p.
But most analysts said the deal was broadly positive, and some said the shares could eventually climb to 670p.
Under the agreement, the tobacco industry has accepted tougher regulation on both their products and advertising in return for immunity from big legal claims.
However individual claims can still be brought, albeit under significant restrictions including no claim for punitive damages.
Tobacco companies have also been forced to concede that tobacco is addictive and the money raised by the levy will be used to pay for treating smoking-related illnesses.
Although few analysts said they were surprised at the broad details of the deal, Mark Duffy, tobacco analyst at SBC Warburg, said the settlement was tougher than the market had been originally expecting.
""The share price is valuing (B.A.T's) U.S. tobacco business at nil -- and given that most future cash flows of that business will be going to the U.S. government, then that's how it should be valued,"" he said.
The deal has so far only been struck with U.S. state attorneys, plaintiff's lawyers and public health representatives and still needs to win the approval of the U.S. Congress.
B.A.T welcomed an end to financial uncertainty which has been dogging the industry amid the threat of escalating legal claims by victims of smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer.
""Although B&amp;W remains confident that it would ultimately win these cases, B.A.T's shareholders and B&amp;W's employees should benefit from the removal of financial uncertainty and its replacement with a greater degree of financial predictability,"" the group stated.
The irony of the settlement, according to Duffy, is that the tobacco industry had agreed to a settlement at a time when its recent track record in court was good.
But other analysts welcomed the settlement, saying that although cigarette prices would have to be raised significantly to pass the costs onto consumers, chunky payments by the industry to ward off its foes had been expected.
""Obviously volumes will go down, but that's what we're used to seeing in the UK...but the industry's profits still go up -- although by not very much,"" noted Nick Bunker, analyst at HSBC James Capel.
""I think fair value (for B.A.Ts shares) is somewhere around 650-670p.
But he warned: ""It'll take time. There will be a lot of uncertainty as we go through the whole Congressional process and lots of days when people will panic a bit when it looks like things are going badly.""
Some analysts said they expected B.A.T to turn its attention now to a demerger of its tobacco and insurance businesses in an effort to boost shareholder value.
Simon Willis, analyst at Charterhouse Tilney, said he thought a demerger more likely when B.A.T was trading nearer five pounds rather than six.
Shares in Britain's biggest cigarette manufacturers Imperial Tobacco Group Plc and Gallaher Group, which are facing a string of law suits by lung cancer victims, were also sharply lower on Monday.
Imperial closed at 393.5p, a loss of 13.5p, and shares in Gallaher Group Plc, Britain's biggest cigarette maker, ended 19.5p weaker at 280.5p.

KirstinRidley,"Shares in Carlton Communications and Granada surged on Tuesday after Britain's two biggest commercial television groups were awarded three key licences to operate multi- channel digital terrestrial TV in the country.
Pay television giant BSkyB, which had been the third member of the consortium called British Digital Broadcasting, was told by the industry regulator to sell its 33 percent stake because of competition concerns.
Carlton and Granada, whose shares rose 10p to 526.5p and 13p to 848.5p respectively, will buy out BSkyB's one-third stake and become joint owners of the new company.
BSkyB, whose largest shareholder is media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, wields effective control over pay TV. It will still provide programmes such as its top movie and sports channels for the group for 75 million pounds ($125.1 million).
However, telecoms watchdog Oftel said it had warned  the Independent Television Commission (ITC) regulator, which awarded the new licences, against allowing BSkyB to provide programmes.
""According to (our) analysis, the participation of BSkyB either as a consortium member or as a long term supplier of certain pay TV services, in particular sports programming, raised substantial competition concerns in the pay TV network and conditional access market,"" it said.
British Digital Broadcasting, which beat a rival bid  to operate the licences from Digital Television Network, owned by America's cable and broadcast group NTL Inc, said it was a great day for British television.
""For British television, going digital ranks alongside the change from black-and-white to colour,"" said Michael Green, the chairman of British Digital Broadcasting (BDB).
""Digital means more choice for viewers. You will be able to receive extra free and subscription television channels through your existing aerial and television. No dish. No cable.""
As both bidders for digital terrestrial licences had made it ""abundantly clear"" that they had wanted all three, the ITC said it had awarded them all to BDB because it had given more assurances than its rival that proposed services could be established and maintained.
BDB, which hopes to be profitable in around five years, plans to pump 300 million pounds into the venture to build the infrastructure, get its technology in place and its programmes organised.
Some analysts say BSkyB stands to gain more from providing the programmes for BDB than being an equity partner. The move into digital broadcasting is the next step in the development of BSkyB, which has grown into one of Britain's most successful companies.
But the group has seen its shares dive over the last week on reports that it would be forced to sell its BDB stake and by the loss of top executives.
On Tuesday, the shares hit a new year low of 452p after a report that soccer clubs were mulling their own TV service when their deal with the pay-tv giant ends in 2001.
The Financial Times said a consultants' report had advised the soccer Premier League that its 670 million pound, four-year deal with BSkyB, which has been crucial in attracting customers to BSkyB's satellite services, represents only half the value of the TV rights.
BSkyB plans to launch 200-channel digital satellite TV in Britain next year.
In comparison, digital terrestrial television, which Britain is pioneering and which involves transmitting digital signals from land-based transmitters to standard roof-top aerials, offers only up to 30 channels.
BDB says that although only 25 percent of homes in Britain pay for extra TV channels, it has research which shows that a ""very large number"" of homes would like extra choice, would be prepared to pay for it and would like to receive a service without having to install a dish or lay a cable.
With a pocket calculator-sized decoder which plugs into TV sets, viewers will receive current terrestrial channels -- BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 -- as well as additional channels such as a free 24-hour news service from the BBC.
A joint venture between the BBC and cable group Flextech Plc will also initially provide four new subscription channels. ($ = 0.599 British Pounds)

KirstinRidley,"Diversified British leisure company First Leisure Corp Plc said on Tuesday first half profits slipped five percent and warned that early second half trading was not as good as expected.
The group, which operates nightclubs, fitness centres and bingo clubs, said pre-tax profits in the six months to end-April fell to 17.2 million pounds ($28.7 million) on turnover of 88.8 million pounds.
Although profits were at the top-end of expectations, a negative trading statement which noted that its ailing bingo hall division was still not improving, sent the group's shares falling 17.5 pence to 318.5p as some analysts scaled back full year profit forecasts.
An interim dividend of 2.64p per share was also below expectations of 2.7-2.75p.
""The results were a bit disappointing,"" said one leisure analyst at a leading brokerage. ""We will have to look at our estimates again.""
First Leisure, which blamed some good weather in May for keeping customers out of its indoor leisure businesses, said its bingo hall division remained its top priority and it pledged innovations to win back consumers in the next year.
Chairman Michael Grade admitted that the group had made operational mistakes in the past. But he told reporters that, with a new management team at the division, the group should be able to turn it around.
Grade joined the company in January after quitting as chief executive at Channel 4.
""I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that the British public has given up playing Bingo,"" he said. ""Bingo is the second biggest leisure activity after angling in the country. We're not getting our share of it...we got it wrong operationally.""
First Leisure, which has a 100 million pound development programme in place, says there is plenty of growth in its dancing and sports divisions -- both in the family entertainment centres and health and fitness operation.
But the group said it had underestimated its competitors' response when it came into the bingo market. Amid little evidence of a consumer boom, Grade noted lottery scratch cards had also taken their toll on market share.
Although Grade declined to be specific, he said the group had to give the restructuring time to effect a turn-around.
""I don't want to put a time frame on it,"" he told a telephone conference call. ""All I would say is that I am not known for having unlimited patience and I'm watching the situation very carefully indeed.""
The group's bingo halls saw comparable sales in the first half fall 25 percent as fewer people were attracted, and traded at a loss of 1.3 million pounds after pre-opening costs and administration charges.
At current trading levels, the business is expected to report a flat result for the second half. First Leisure plans to complete an initial development programme of 20 new generation bingo halls in 1997/98.
Grade declined to comment on market talk that First Leisure might be taken over by a company such as leisure company Rank Group Plc.
""This is a very independent business. It thrives on being independent and I intend to keep it that way,"" he said. ""I'm here for the long term.""
"
KirstinRidley,"Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) watchdog said on Wednesday it had every confidence in its decision to award three key licences to run digital terrestrial television despite a possible legal challenge.
Digital Television Network (DTN), which is owned by American cable and broadcasting group NTL Inc, says it might seek legal redress and challenge the ITC's decision on Tuesday to award the licences to its rival British Digital Broadcasting (BDB) consortium.
But an ITC spokeswoman said: ""We are always ready to defend our decisions in a judicial review. But this is really a matter for DTN to decide.""
BDB is jointly owned by Britain's biggest commercial television groups, Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc. Pay-TV giant British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc will be the main programme supplier.
The ITC conceded that DTN's programme plans for the digital era were more innovative than those of BDB. But they tended to appeal more to a niche audience than BDB's suggested diet of mainly popular Sky movies and sport.
The ITC emphasised that there were other criteria in choosing a winner, such as ensuring the success and promotion of digital terrestrial TV.
""Taking all the criteria as a whole, BDB had the stronger package,"" a spokeswoman said.
Digital terrestrial television, which is likely to be launched in Britain next year, will allow customers to receive up to 30 channels broadcast from conventional transmitters to domestic aerials.
BSkyB, which has enjoyed a near-monopoly position in the British subscription television market, supplies popular sports and movies to both cable and satellite services. It also plans to launch 200-channel digital satellite services next year.
Analysts and lawyers contacted on Wednesday thought  any attempt to seek legal redress would have at best a slim chance of success.
""I think on balance I wouldn't expect this to succeed,"" said one corporate lawyer. ""But any litigation is pretty unpredictable. The weakness in any case is that the ITC has clearly appreciated the difficulty and taken steps as they have seen it to meet that.""
The ITC has asked BSkyB to drop its plans to take a 33 percent BDB stake -- which Carlton and Granada are now buying for 75 million pounds ($125.1 million) -- on competition grounds.
DTN, meanwhile, is still seeking legal advice.
""We're still considering our options ranging from doing nothing at all to...either a judicial review or discussions with other bodies. We haven't come down in any way on any decision,"" a spokesman said.
But he welcomed the advice given to the ITC by the telecommunications watchdog, Oftel, that awarding the licences to BDB might be anti-competitive.
Oftel director general Don Cruickshank had warned the ITC that allowing BSkyB to be either an equity partner or a long-term supplier of pay-TV programmes raised ""substantial competition concerns"".
In the meantime, Oftel is inviting views from all interest parties on its general competition analysis so it can use the comments in other cases.
""The way we are analysing the effects of one adjacent market on another is of extreme relevance to the markets we regulate,"" a spokeswoman said.
She added that the decision to award the licences to BDB despite Oftel's advice was a matter for the ITC.
""We're bound to look at competition issues but they look at much wider issues,"" she said. ""We can give our advice -- but that's as far as we go."" ($ = 0.599 British Pounds)

KirstinRidley,"British commercial TV giant Granada Group on Wednesday tabled a formal 711 million pound ($1.2 billion) agreed bid for its neighbour Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television although some shareholders remained opposed the price.
(corrects dollar conversion).
Yorkshire Tyne-Tees Chairman Ward Thomas called on institutional investor Mercury Asset Management to rethink its opposition to the 11.75 pound per share bid, which he said was a good price.
""I hope on reflection they will come into line,"" he told Reuters in an interview, adding that any speculation that a counter bidder may offer a higher price might well be ""just poppycock"".
MAM, who Thomas said had been the most vocal opponent of the takeover price, declined to comment amid speculation that it had bought some of its five percent Yorkshire stake at 13 pounds a share.
Thomas said he had received no indication from United News &amp; Media Plc about how the company would vote its 14 percent Yorkshire stake amid talk that managing director Clive Hollick may launch a counter bid.
""I've no idea whether Clive Hollick will or not,"" said Ward. ""But I would have thought his target is much more likely to be HTV Group Plc.
""But if he does, well the shareholders will be happy and MAM will be right and I will be wrong.""
Granada, which already owns 27 percent of Yorkshire, is offering two new Granada shares and 1,825.32 pence in cash for every three Yorkshire shares -- an offer Thomas said he had agreed to by telephone while on a holiday in the South of France just over two weeks ago.
The companies said that Yorkshire would pay an interim dividend of 7.5 pence.
Thomas said in the offer statement that although Yorkshire had fully recovered from problems that beset it in 1993 -- when it plunged into the red and its share price collapsed to around 1.20 pounds -- it was operating in an increasingly competitive market.
""As a result, your board now believes that a combination with the Granada broadcasting business is in the best interest of shareholders and will safeguard the future of Yorkshire and Tyne Tees Television and their ability to provide for the areas they serve,"" he said.
Shares in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees traded were slightly firmer after a sobering trading statement limited gains, rising 2.5p to 1,157.5p having earlier scaled to a high of 11.70 pounds.
""What's hurting the (Yorkshire) shares is its trading statement...It's a pretty damning indictment of what's happening,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Yorkshire said it expected a disappointing second quarter, citing lower-than-expected growth in ITV advertising revenue and a failure to increase market share.
The statement also said the company believed total advertising revenue growing for commercial television ITV would show only minimal growth during the first half of 1997. It blamed the slowdown on the launch of a new channel and industry-wide weakness.
Granada chairman Gerry Robinson remained unperturbed, and said the two companies' existing airtime and international programme sales arrangements provided a solid foundation for a merger.
""We believe that the strategic arguments in favour of the combination are both powerful and widely accepted,"" he said.
Granada, whose interests span broadcasting, leisure, hotels and catering, owns the independent television (ITV) franchise for north-west England, which is adjacent to Yorkshire's area.
The deal will need regulatory approval, and Robinson said earlier this month he believed it would take some two months to complete even if everything went smoothly. ($ = 0.599 British Pounds)

KouroshKarimkhany,"Apple Computer Inc. stock rose Thursday on renewed speculation that the troubled computer maker was trying to sell itself to a bigger company.
The stock of the Cupertino, Calif., company gained 87.5 cents to $18.875 on trading of 4.9 million shares, making it one of the most active issues on the Nasdaq. Earlier, the stock traded as high as $19.125.
On Wednesday, Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal revealed he bought a 5 percent stake in Apple for $115 million because he expects the company to turn itself around.
Last week, software billionaire Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp., said he intended to form an investor group to try to buy a majority stake in Apple, take control of the company and revamp it with a new management team.
The New York Times, citing unnamed Apple sources, also reported Thursday that Apple was actively seeking to sell itself and has approached high-performance computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. again. Sun tried to buy Apple in late 1995, but negotiations fell apart over price.
An Apple spokeswomen declined to comment about the speculation. Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy also declined to comment about the rumours, ""no matter how accurate or silly they may be.""
Mulling takeover bids is nothing new at Apple. In addition to Sun, Apple negotiated with International Business Machines Corp. about a merger two years ago. IBM also demurred over price.
Former high-level Apple executives who keep close contact with the company said Thursday they have not heard of any recent moves by Apple to approach suitors.
One former executive said, however, that increasing pressure from investors -- who hold stock near a 10-year low -- may make Chairman Gilbert Amelio more receptive to any takeover proposal that might come along.
Trouble is, none might come along, analysts said.
""It's always possible, but we're not putting a lot of weight into it,"" said Peter Andrews, analyst at brokerage AG Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
Even though Apple still has a huge following of Macintosh users, the company will not be able to stop its sales from falling for at least another year, making it an unattractive buyout, analysts said.
In the past five quarters, Apple has reported financial losses of close to $1 billion and has had two rounds of job cuts totalling 5,400. Despite the massive expense reductions, the company does not expect to report a profit until the September quarter.
Company executives have told investors they expect revenue for the year to fall about 20 percent to $8 billion.
The most likely suitor for now is Ellison, the flamboyant head of Oracle who has publicly criticised Amelio for failing to turn the company around.
Ellison set up a World Wide Web site last week to solicit e-mail from investors to gauge support (http://www.us.oracle.com/corporate/press/html/apple.html). Depending on the response, he would launch a bid.
A spokesman for Ellison said it was too early for him to comment on the results. Ellison could not be reached immediately for comment.
Some investors said they were not impressed by Ellison's offer.
Richard Ash, a private investor who owns 3,000 Apple shares, said he would not sell his stock to Ellison because he was not offering a premium over the current stock price.

KouroshKarimkhany,"Rational Software Corp., expanding its expertise in offering software programming products, said Monday it agreed to buy rival Pure Atria Corp. in a stock deal initially valued at about $839 million.
Both companies' stocks plunged, however, after Pure Atria said its first-quarter earnings would be far less than Wall Street expected because of the difficulty the company has had managing its own recent acquisitions. Rational could have the same difficulties, analysts said.
""We're looking at a lot of questions about why the hell Rational would do this when they appeared to be winning the war with Pure Atria anyway,"" said Kris Tuttle, analyst at Soundview Financial Group.
Rational Software's stock fell $9.75, or 42 percent, to close at $13.625, while Pure Atria's stock fell $7.75, or 44 percent, to $10 on the Nasdaq. Both were among the most active on Nasdaq and both were the biggest percentage losers in U.S. trading.
Under terms of the acquisition, Rational would pay 0.9 of its shares for each of Pure Atria's 39.92 million shares outstanding. Based on Rational's Friday closing stock price of $23.375, the transaction would be worth $839 million. Monday's stock slide slashed the deal's value by 42 percent to about $489 million.
Both companies write development tools, a type of software that helps programmers write other software.
Rational, based in Santa Clara, Calif., specialises in methodology tools, which help programmers design the skeleton of complex software projects. Pure Atria specialises in development and testing tools, which let programmers write and test chunks of software code.
The acquisition would give Rational all the components a big developer would need to write commercial-quality software, said Stan Dolberg, director of software strategies of market researcher Forrester Research Inc.
But Rational is placing its bets on rigid, industrial-strength development tools at an awkward time. Rational and other development tool vendors face a fundamental threat from Java, a programming language that is all the rage among Internet and computer networking software developers, who do not need such rigid tools.
""My suspicion is that there are a lot of developers waiting to see what happens with Java,"" said Catlin Wolfard, analyst at brokerage Arcadia Investment Corp. in Portland, Ore. ""Every stock chart in the development market is down, down, down this year"" because of lower earnings prospects as big development tool purchases are put off.
Rational also is buying a company that has had a hard time managing its own acquisitions, analysts said. Pure Atria's trouble could now be Rational's, Andrew Roskill, analyst at Smith Barney, told the brokerage's clients Monday.
Pure Atria, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was formed last August when Atria Software Inc. bought Pure Software Inc. The companies still are struggling to meld their operations.
Partly because of the difficult merger, Pure Atria said it expected first-quarter earnings to be between 2 cents to 4 cents a share, compared with 9 cents in the same quarter a year ago. Wall Street expected earnings of 12 cents, according to First Call, which tracks such estimates.
Rational executives said they viewed this as the right time to buy Pure Atria. The acquisition will accelerate Rational's expansion into the testing market, said Jerry Rudisin, Rational's vice president of corporate marketing.

KouroshKarimkhany,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported an unexpected first-quarter profit Monday, reflecting surprisingly strong computer chip sales.
The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company earned $12.95 million or 9 cents a share for the quarter ended March 30, compared with a profit of $25.3 million, or 18 cents, in the same quarter a year ago.
Wall Street analysts had expected AMD, a maker of specialized memory chips and microprocessors, to report a loss of 3 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates.
AMD said first-quarter revenue rose 1.4 percent to $552 million from $544.2 million a year ago. Revenue for the most recent quarter was about $10 million higher than Wall Street expected.
""The important message of the first quarter is that the company is profitable and that they are starting an incredible product cycle,"" said analyst Mark Edelstone, at brokerage Prudential Securities Inc.
The results were announced after the market closed Monday. AMD shares had risen $1.875 to $41.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares rose an additional $1.75 to $43 in after-hours trading.
AMD Chairman Jerry Sanders said all of the company's businesses improved over the fourth quarter, when AMD posted a loss of $21.2 million, or 15 cents a share.
""Recovering strength in all sectors of our business produced the sales growth necessary for AMD to return to modest profitability even before volume shipments of AMD-K6 MMX processors,"" Sanders said, referring to AMD's newest chip.
""Revenue growth was led by flash memories, Microsoft Windows compatible microprocessors, and programmable logic devices from our Vantis division.""
Last week, AMD introduced the K6 chip, a microprocessor for standard personal computers that can handle basic calculations slightly faster than Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro chip.
Based on expected demand for an alternative to Intel's pricey offerings and improving operations, AMD stock has doubled since the beginning of the year.
Sanders said the company shipped only 10,000 K6 chips during the quarter. He said, however, that AMD plans to increase production substantially in the new few months.
""We are ramping production in order to ship hundreds of thousands of AMD-K6 MMX processors during the current quarter, and millions of units in the second half of 1997,"" Sanders said in a statement.
In order to boost acceptance for its new chip, AMD is embarking on an aggressive marketing campaign, starting with TV commercials this week on the popular NBC sitcom ""Seinfeld"".
Intel, the world's biggest maker of computer chips, has spent millions in the past three years on the ""Intel Inside"" campaign, even though Intel's chips are the brains of about 90 percent of the world's PCs.
Before the K6, AMD's microprocessors had been at least three years behind Intel in computing horsepower. It did not have to counter Intel's marketing juggernaut because its customers mainly were second-tier PC makers that bought its chips for low-priced machines.
Two years ago, the company gambled its financial future to make sure that the K6 was just as fast, or faster, than comparable Intel chips.
The gamble paid off, at least technically. The K6 beats the Pentium Pro in most everyday applications, according to trade magazines. Not only that, AMD plans to sell it for at least 25 percent less than the Pentium.
Armed with the K6, AMD now plans to chase Intel's best customers -- makers of high-end professional and consumer PCs.
"
KouroshKarimkhany,"Apple Computer Inc. Thursday launched the second wave of a massive advertising campaign started earlier this year to raise the profile of its computers and rebuild its tarnished image.
In 16 U.S. daily newspapers, Apple's eight page inserts, headlined ""Only Apple,"" touted the benefits of its new products, including a speedy Power Macintosh for home and small-business use, and a Mac that can run programmes written for Microsoft Corp.'s Windows, the dominant operating system software for personal computers.
The advertising campaign is part of Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio's promise to shareholders in January to put the troubled company's marketing department ""back on the attack.""
Apple, which virtually created the personal computer 20 years ago with an easy-to-use machine, has been struggling amid fierce competition from cheaper PCs based on technology from Microsoft and semiconductor giant Intel Corp.
In recent months, Apple's products have been overshadowed by dismal financial results, management turmoil and takeover speculation.
Just last week, Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal disclosed he had purchased more than 5 percent of Apple, fuelling speculation he might team up with Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry Ellison to acquire the company.
Industry analysts said the advertisements were an effort by the Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker to draw attention away from its dismal financial performance and back to its new products.
""A week from now they're going to release what can be considered really bad news,"" said Tim Bajarin, president of market research firm Creative Strategies Research International. ""This is a preemptive move to get people off the bad news and onto the good news, which is some really exciting new products.""
Next week, Apple is expected to report a loss of more than $500 million for the second quarter of fiscal 1997, bringing its total red ink over the last six quarters to more than $1.5 billion.
In addition to a couple of one-time items -- a charge for laying off 4,100 workers and another charge for acquiring Next Software Inc., Apple's second quarter is also expected to feature a hefty operating loss, reflecting slower than expected sales of its flagship Macintosh line.
Experts say Apple's new line of computers should help slow down its eroding market share but it remains to be seen if Apple can regain its former glory.
""The new products are the best they've had in a long, long time, and will help them stay afloat,"" said Scott Miller, computer industry analyst at market researcher Dataquest. ""The advertising for the products is icing on the cake.""
Apple declined to comment on how much the campaign costs, but it is certainly more than the $1.6 million Apple spent in 1984 to tout the Macintosh in a brash TV spot aired during the Super Bowl. The 60-second spot, featuring an athlete hurling a hammer at a huge video screen helped establish Apple as an innovative company out to change the world.
Since 1993, Apple's share of the worldwide computer market has been cut almost in half, tumbling to 5.2 percent in 1996 from 9.4 percent in 1993.
Apple customers and shareholders had criticised Amelio for not having done enough to tout the Macintosh's ease-of-use and technical superiority over Windows-based personal computers.
Apple started the current campaign in February, with two-page advertisments in newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. The previous advertisements and the ones unveiled Thursday focus on the Mac's technical superiority.
Apple plans to run more ads in coming days. The company also is planning more multi-page spreads in coming months as new products come out.
"
KouroshKarimkhany,"Intel Corp. said Monday its first-quarter net income more than doubled, but its better-than-expected performance was overshadowed by a warning that it expected little revenue growth in the second quarter.
Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, also said the number of chips it shipped in the first quarter was flat compared with the fourth quarter. That suggested its new line of Pentium microprocessors with souped-up multimedia capabilities is not helping to boost personal computer sales, analysts said.
""It was a solid quarter, showing Intel's dominance,"" said Peter Andrew, analyst at investment bank AG Edwards in St. Louis. ""But the flat revenue projection could upset some people.""
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said net income rose to $1.98 billion, or $2.20 a share, from $849 million, or $1.02 a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
Wall Street expected Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., to earn $2.07 a share, according to a recent First Call analyst survey.
First-quarter revenue rose 39 percent to $6.45 billion from $4.64 billion in the same quarter a year ago.
Intel, however, said it expects revenue in the second quarter -- when PC sales tradionally pick up from the after-Christmas lull -- to be flat or only slightly higher compared with the first quarter.
Intel is a bellwether for the entire computer industry. Flat sales could mean PC sales have ""plateaued"" for now, said Drew Peck, analyst at Cowen &amp; Co. in Boston.
On top of the flat revenue, Intel plans to boost marketing expenses by 7 percent to 9 percent in the second quarter.
""When you factor in these guidelines, you would have to expect earnings to be down"" in the second quarter compared with the first, Peck said.
Intel released its earnings after the market closed. Its shares had closed up $3.25 at $133.75. The stock initially rose in after-hours trading but then fell as low as $129.25 due to concerns over the revenue forecast.
Intel executives told analysts in a conference call that it had strong demand for its new high-end chips, the Pentium Pro and Pentium with MMX media enhancement technology.
The company also said it expects strong demand for its Pentium II microprocessor. Scheduled to be launched in May, Pentium II crunches numbers much faster than its predecessors.
Intel said its revenue in the first quarter rose in all geographic regions except the Americas. Asia-Pacific revenue, which accounts for about 20 percent of Intel's total, almost doubled.
At the end of the month, the company also will cut some of its chip prices -- some analysts have estimated by as much as 20 percent.
Intel cuts its chip prices regularly about once a quarter. While the cuts are expected to drive PC prices down and increase demand, some investors have seen it as a defensive move against rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp.
Two weeks ago, Advanced Micro revealed the K6 microprocessor, a chip that works faster than high-end Pentium chips but costs 25 percent less.
Cyrix, another competitor, has been selling a high-powered Pentium knock-off since the beginning of the year that sells for much less than comparable offerings from Intel.
Even with the conservative revenue forecast and the first real threat of competition in years, Intel is one of the strongest stocks, analysts said.
International markets are booming, which could offset slowing PC sales growth in the U.S., said Martin Pyykkonen, analyst at investment bank Furman Selz in New York.
And business software based on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT is driving demand for Intel's speedy chips, he said.
"
KouroshKarimkhany,"Apple Computer Inc. reported a $708 million second-quarter loss Wednesday, reflecting a charge for the layoff of a third of its employees and weaker sales of its personal computers,
Apple said, however, that strong sales of new, speedy PCs and laptops and lower expenses would help the company meet its goal of reporting a profit by its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in September.
The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer company's net loss, equivalent to $5.64 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended March 28 compared with a net loss of $740 million, or $5.99 a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Apple's loss from operations of $186 million, or $1.48 a share, was worse than the consensus industry analyst forecast of $1.22 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst forecasts.
The $708 million net loss included a $155 million charge to cover the cost of layoffs and a $375 million charge for the acquisition of software developer Next Software Inc.
Apple said, however, that it expects to see higher revenue and a reduced operating loss in the third quarter as its restructuring program takes hold. In March, the company said it would lay off 4,100 employees and reorganize operations to cut costs.
""Don't open champagne bottles yet, but the process seems to be working,"" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.
During the quarter, Apple introduced a jazzy laptop and a speedy desktop machine for small businesses, schools and homes. Sales of the new machines have been strong, the company said.
""We feel the worst is behind us and our strategy is on track,"" Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio said in a telephone conference call with analysts. He said sales will probably increase in the third quarter over the second and that the company probably will meet its goal of being profitable again by the fourth quarter.
Still, even with better financial health, Apple faces serious problems, analysts said.
The number of Apple computers shipped worldwide in the second quarter plunged 33 percent to 602,000 units, compared with 892,000 units in the same quarter a year ago. The drop was bigger than most analysts expected.
Sales in Japan and Europe also were weak, Apple executives said in the conference call.
""I want to see a couple of positive quarters before I say they're beginning to turn the corner,"" said Michael Kwatinetz, analyst at the DMG Technology Group investment bank in New York.
To keep costs in line with declining sales, Apple in the past year has laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company also has seen its entire management suite change in 15 months.
The uncertainty about the company's future still is keeping customers away from the Mac aisle at stores, analysts said.
Dataquest, which tracks PC sales worldwide, says Apple's share of the worldwide market fell to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent. The slide left Apple's market share at the lowest point in three years.

KouroshKarimkhany,"AirTouch Communications Inc. agreed on Friday to buy U S West Media Group's cellular phone operations for about $4.5 billion in stock and debt, replacing a complex 1994 agreement between the companies.
If the transaction goes through, AirTouch would become the second-largest cellular service provider in the United States -- behind AT&amp;T Corp. -- with 5.3 million customers in 20 states from the West Coast to the Mississippi River.
The companies warned, however, that they would call off the acquisition if Congress passes legislation that closes a popular corporate tax loophole.
Under the agreement, AirTouch, based in San Francisco, would pay about $2.2 billion in stock and assume $2.2 billion of U S West's debt.
AirTouch would acquire New Vector, U S West's domestic cellular operation, and U S West's interest in PrimeCo Personal Communications, an advanced wireless joint venture among three Baby Bell regional phone companies.
""It's a good move to put the companies together,"" said Charles DiSanza, telecommunications analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.
""They've been operating together for a while and already the economies of scale have helped the U S West operations get substantially more profitable.""
AirTouch shares rose $1 to $24.50 in midafternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., rose 50 cents to $17.75
Analysts said AirTouch would be paying a relatively cheap price for a healthy enterprise.
""The markets U S West has -- Seattle, Denver, Salt Lake City -- are some of the fastest growing cellular markets in the country,"" said Mark Lowenstein, analyst at Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston.
The U S West acquisition also would give AirTouch a strong regional ""footprint"" against AT&amp;T's cellular business, Lowenstein said.
AirTouch and U S West agreed to merge their cellular operations back in 1994 in a complex, three-step transaction. But that deal never won much favor from investors because the final value was to be determined by an outside appraisal of U S West's operations.
Friday's transaction ""eliminates much of the uncertainty investors had about the previous agreement,"" said Kevin Roe, analyst at investment bank ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. ""This one clearly spells out the terms and the timeline.""
The companies could scrap the acquisition, however, if Congress passes legislation introduced Thursday. The bill seeks to bar so-called Morris Trust transactions, which let companies sell chunks of their operations without paying taxes.
If the bill passes and regulators apply it to U S West, the companies could consider going back to their original agreement, the companies said.
Customers of U S West Media Group's cellular service will not notice any service changes, the companies said. Most of U S West's domestic cellular employees also will become AirTouch employees. UMG.N  T.N

KouroshKarimkhany,"The number of personal computers shipped worldwide rose by 15.4 percent in the first quarter, led by strong sales at Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., market researcher Dataquest said Sunday.
The first quarter traditionally has been a slow time for PC makers. So a robust 15 percent growth means the industry is well on track to grow by 19 percent for 1997, as previously forecast, said Bill Schaub, director of computer research at Dataquest.
""Everybody had a really good quarter,"" Schaub said.
In the first three months of the year, the industry shipped 18.7 million machines, compared with 16.3 million in the same period a year ago.
Compaq, the world's biggest PC maker, widened its market-share lead in the quarter by shipping 1.87 million units, 18 percent better than the 1.59 million units last year. Compaq had 10 percent of the world's PC market.
Dell Computer Corp., the world's fourth-biggest PC maker, had the biggest shipment increase. The company's shipments rose 62 percent to 945,000 units in the first quarter, compared with the 584,000 units in the same quarter a year ago.
IBM, in the No. 2 spot, had a solid quarter, shipping 1.6 million units, 37 percent more than last year's 1.17 million units.
Packard Bell NEC Inc., the third-biggest PC maker, had a flat quarter, shipping 1.11 million PCs. Packard Bell is a closely held company.
Apple Computer Inc. was notable for not ranking in the top five spots this quarter. The company traditionally has been a fixture on Dataquest's top-five lists.
Still struggling to return to profits, Apple shipped only 602,000 units in the first quarter -- well below Toshiba Corp., the No. 5 vendor, which shipped 879,000 PCs.
Schaub said he was particularly impressed by Dell, which sells its PCs only through mail-order.
""Dell is really leveraging their direct approach,"" Schaub said. ""Because they can move their inventory really fast, they have a 15 percent cost advantage over Compaq and IBM.""
Dell's approach has been so successful, in fact, that Compaq wants to copy it. In recent weeks Wall Street analysts have speculated that Compaq will try to expand its direct-sales business by buying another company.
Compaq may be eyeing Gateway 2000 Inc. or Micron Electronics Inc., analysts have said in recent days.
Following is a chart of top-five vendors in the first quarter:
 Company	     1997	     1996	   Market share
 Compaq	  1.870 million   1.589 million   10.0 percent
 IBM	     1.600 million   1.166 million    8.5
 Packard Bell  1.108 million   1.070 million    5.9
 Dell		945,000	   584,000	  5.0
 Toshiba	   879,000	   560,000	  4.7
 Others	 12.338 million  11.281 million   65.8
    Total     18.740 million  16.250 million

KouroshKarimkhany,"Intel Corp. on Wednesday will unveil its Pentium II microprocessor, a speedy computer chip that will help the world's biggest chip maker break into new markets and stave off rivals.
The new chip is based on the Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro, but includes software and circuitry -- dubbed MMX technology -- that makes it more adept at handling graphics. In most cases, it works 30 percent to 40 percent faster than today's mainstream Intel products, analysts said.
About a dozen personal computer makers will announce Wednesday they plan to use the chip in high-end machines, said Richard Dracott, Intel marketing manager.
Most of the new Pentium II machines will be desktop PCs aimed at engineers and professionals who use a lot of computing horsepower for graphics, analysts said.
Although the Pentium II is a souped-up version of the Pentium Pro, it is the biggest product introduction for Intel in years, said Mark Kirstein, research director at semiconductor market researcher In-Stat in Scottsdale, Ariz.
""The Pentium Pro was really a niche product"" for high-end desktops and servers, the computers that control networks, Kirstein said. ""The Pentium II is aimed at the mainstream.""
A streamlined design and cheaper production will make it easier for Intel to churn out the new chip, Kirstein said.
Within a year, most new PCs -- even the ones geared for home use -- will be based on the Pentium II, analysts said.
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., also is trying to pitch the chip to new kinds of customers. The company has told video game makers, for example, that the chip can handle the intense graphics requirements of coin-operated arcade games.
""We will be delivering significant performance improvement over the fastest Pentium Pro,"" Dracott said.
Intel said part of the performance improvement comes from a new so-called cartridge design. The Pentium II will be sold to PC manufacturers in a plastic housing that includes specialised memory chips. Because the microprocessor and memory chips are packed closely together on a seperate circuit board, they can pump data to the rest of the PC much faster, Intel said.
There is one more benefit: It frustrates Intel rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp., which for the first time are a credible threat to Intel.
AMD and Cyrix make chips that work like the Pentium and sell them to PC makers for much less. But their chips are designed to fit into the old slots for microprocessors.
AMD spent the past two years working on the K6 chip, which works as fast as the Pentium Pro and is 25 percent cheaper, but does not fit into the new cartridge slot.
Since most of the PC makers are expected to use Intel's cartridge design, AMD now has to spend time and money to make the K6 compatible.

KouroshKarimkhany,"Intel Corp. will release its speedy new Pentium II microprocessor this week, but a glitch in the computer chip that turned up Monday could mar the launch.
The world's biggest chip maker plans to roll out the new microprocessor -- the heart of the personal computer -- Wednesday, and about a dozen personal computer makers will announce they plan to use it, said Richard Dracott, Intel marketing manager.
Intel officials said they were looking into reports the chips may contain a so-called floating point glitch that could cause computational errors. A similar problem bedeviled the original Pentium chip in 1994.
A spokesman for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip supplier said the problem appears to crop up when a computer performs an obscure calculation. The company said engineers were running tests on the chips to determine the extent of the problem but at this time Intel has no plans to recall them.
The problem appeared to affect only the Pentium II and Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro chips. It was not immediately clear how many chips may be affected by the problem.
News of the problem, which was posted on a Web site called ""Intel Secrets"" (http://www.x86.org) and reported by CMP Media's EE Times Online (http://techweb.cmp.com/eet/823), cropped up just as Intel was preparing to launch the Pentium II on Wednesday.
Analysts said it was not clear if the flaw is as as serious as one which cost the semiconductor giant $475 million in 1994.
""It does not strike me right now as as big a problem as a couple years ago,"" Dataquest analyst Nathan Brookwood said, adding the problem would crop up in poorly written computer programs that store decimal numbers in a certain way.

KouroshKarimkhany,"Intel Corp. said Friday its Pentium Pro and new Pentium II chips have a flaw that can cause computers to sometimes make mistakes but said the problems could be fixed easily with rewritten software.
The company will not need to recall the chips, Intel officials said. The flaw was officially dubbed the ""Flag Erratum"" by Intel, the world's biggest chip maker.
""Basically, an erratum is a design defect that may cause the product to deviate from published specifications,"" Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop said. ""All microprocessors have flaws in them.""
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has been investigating the flaw since it was uncovered by an independent analyst last week.
The discovery caused concern among investors and customers because it came just four days before Intel launched the Pentium II, its biggest new product in years.
Some investors feared the flaw could force Intel to replace tens of thousands of chips, as it did in 1994 due to a defect in the original Pentium chip.
International Business Machines Corp. said the flaw should not have any major impact on its PC customers.
""We currently have no information to believe that this reported anomaly will have a major impact on our customers,"" said a spokesman for the IBM PC Co.
""We are continuing to ship product,"" a spokesman for Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. said. ""Every processor has some kind of errata. This is obviously one that Intel is working on. It's not a show stopper.""
The Flag Erratum occurs when some programs try to convert so-called floating point numbers, or decimal numbers, into integers. In some cases, the chip makes rounding errors, and it does not raise a warning flag that it made the error.
Waldrop said Intel would not judge how serious the flaw was, leaving that to computer makers and software developers. But Intel will help developers rewrite programs to compensate for the error when it does come up.
The Pentium Pro, a chip Intel began selling in November 1995, also has the defect.
At first glance, the flaw does not appear to be too serious because it had gone undetected in the Pentium Pro for 18 months, said Rick Doherty, a director at Envisioneering Group Inc., a market researcher company.
""We've got a year-and-half of work on this puppy and no one has reported a single problem with their applications yet,"" Doherty said.
""But it's not over yet,"" he said. ""This means that an IBM and a Microsoft will have to go through their software packages to see if things are affected by it.""
Waldrop said Intel will fix the defect in the new chips it makes. Investors apparently were not concerned about the flaw, as Intel rose 75 cents to $159.50 on Nasdaq.

KouroshKarimkhany,"Citrix Systems Inc. stock surged 69 percent Monday after Microsoft Corp. agreed to license its software technology and include it in upcoming versions of Microsoft Windows NT.
As part of the agreement, Citrix, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., will get an initial $75 million fee from Microsoft and as much as $100 million in royalties tied to sales of Microsoft products using Citrix technology, the companies said.
Citrix shares jumped $13.375 to $32.625 on trading of 12.9 million shares on Nasdaq, where it was the most active stock.
Citrix writes software that lets an old PC or an outdated terminal -- a type of computer that gets its computing horsepower from a corporate network -- run programmes written for Microsoft's Windows.
Monday's agreement erased much of the concern in recent months about Citrix. In February, Citrix's stock plunged after Microsoft told Citrix executives that if the companies could not agree to develop the technology together, Microsoft would go it alone.
Microsoft agreed to add Citrix's so-called multi-user technology to Windows NT, which would let several terminal users share one server for running common business software, such as data-entry and word processing.
The agreement makes it easier for Citrix to sell additional products to Windows NT customers, analysts said.
""Basically, Citrix now has Windows NT pre-enabled for their products,"" said John Powers, analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. in San Francisco. ""For Citrix, it's good that Microsoft has multi-user capabilites. It's even better that it's from Citrix.""
The agreement also is a shift in strategy for Microsoft. In recent months, Microsoft, after initially ridiculing the idea, has taken the idea of stripped-down network computers seriously. Big corporate customers have been clamouring for cheaper and easier-to-use machines that do not require the latest in software and hardware gadgets.
Microsoft also said Monday it agreed to license technology from France's Prologue Software SA, another company that writes terminal software.
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., owns a 6 percent stake in Citrix. Microsoft's treasurer, Greg Maffei, also sits on Citrix's board.
Some analysts, however, were cautious about Citrix's outlook in coming years. As Microsoft adds more multi-user functions to Windows NT, customers might not need separate Citrix products.
""That's what I have warned our investors about,"" said Dawn Simon, analyst at investment bank Furman Selz in New York. ""It's a truce between the companies, but the burden will be on Citrix to innovate.""
Under the agreement, Citrix will get up to $100 million in royalties from Microsoft. Mark Templeton, Citrix vice president of worldwide marketing, said it is not clear whether Citrix will get a new royalty contract once Citrix gets all of the original $100 million.

KouroshKarimkhany,"Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday it plans to release an operating system that will work on personal computers based on chips from Intel Corp. as well as on Apple computers.
At its annual developer conference, the company also said it will release programming tools in the next few months that will allow companies to write software for Apple computers once and automatically convert their products to run on PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
The radical strategy is part of Apple's plan to keep software companies from abandoning Apple products, Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio told a crowd of 1,900 programmers here.
""For those of you who seek substantial business on both the Mac and Windows platforms, this new development environment holds tremendous promise,"" Amelio said. ""You can (write your applications once) and with a simple recompilation release them for both platforms.""
Until now, Apple has released operating system software that runs only on Apple-designed hardware.
Amelio said Apple's next-generation operating system, code-named Rhapsody, will run on Apple-designed computers, and on PCs based on Intel chips.
""It's a really good idea if they can deliver,"" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, analyst at market researcher International Data Corp. By entering the PC market, Apple will have a great opportunity to show the world that its technology is special, Zwetchkenbaum said.
For the past two years, Apple has been scrambling to come up with improvements to the Macintosh that would set it apart from PCs. Until 1995, Apple had relied on its computers' famed ease-of-use as a selling point, but Microsoft's release of Windows 95 took away much of the impact of Apple's pitch.
Last year, Apple gave up on a mired effort to revamp the Macintosh Operating System, the fundamental program that gives the Mac its look. In December, the company bought Next Software Inc. to get its software overhaul going again, and to use Next software as the foundation of a next-generation operating system.
The move concerned lots of programmers, though, because of fears that the new operating system would not run the products they designed for the older Mac operating system. Programmers also were not thrilled to develop products for yet another operating system.
Apple plans to spend the rest of this week convincing programmers that it is a worthwhile investment to write software for Rhapsody from now on.
Programs written specifically for Rhapsody can easily be converted to run on old Macs, as well as a new class of Apple machines using the Rhapsody operating system, and PCs running the Windows operating system, Amelio promised.
Until now, Mac programmers who wanted to write a version of their product for Intel machines had to make huge changes to their programs.
The first versions of Rhapsody will be delivered later this year, Amelio said.
Still, Apple faces a big challenge moving Mac developers to Rhapsody, Zwetchenbaum said. Switching to a new operating system involves learning lots of technical details.
Apple's stock closed unchanged at $17.56 on Nasdaq.

KouroshKarimkhany,"Informix Corp. ,facing plunging sales of its database software products, needs to raise cash and to refinance its leases to keep its operations going, the company said in filings with federal regulators.
The struggling database software company plans to raise capital to offset upcoming losses from operations, and to shore up its shrinking cash supply, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Informix also is considering arranging for the refinancing of leases on parcels of land in Santa Clara, Calif., where it intended to build new corporate headquarters.
""While the company believes it will acquire the necessary financing, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available,"" Informix said in the filing. ""The company's failure to raise working capital would have adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.""
Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., is the second-largest publisher of database software, the computer programmes that let companies store huge libraries of vital information on computer networks.
Earlier this year, the company made a huge bet on a jazzy new database product, dubbed Universal Server, aimed at customers in the just-emerging multimedia business.
The bet, Informix executives have said, turned out to be misplaced. By focusing its marketing on the new product, Informix neglected its older, better-selling products.
It reported a first-quarter loss of $140.1 million, or 93 cents, on revenue of $133.7 million. Sales declined 34 percent in the first quarter.
The huge loss slashed Informix's cash supply in half to $120.6 million from $261 million, the company said. Part of the decline also was due to a $61.5 million cash deposit with Banque Nationale de Paris, which provided the financing for the Santa Clara land.
Informix's financial trouble also has raised speculation that the company is a candidate for an acquisition by a larger software vendor, possibly Computer Associates International Inc. or Netscape Communications Corp., analysts said.
In late afternoon, Informix shares were up $2.19 at $11.50 on trading of 17 million shares on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue.

LydiaZajc,"Toronto's key stock index soared to close more than one percent higher on Monday but the broader market ended mixed as gold issues slipped on weaker bullion prices.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index jumped 69.47 points, or 1.1 percent, to 6144.25.
Trading was moderately heavy  at 89.8 million shares worth C$1.72 billion ($1.25 billion).
Despite broad gains, declining issues still outnumbered advances 488 to 465 while 286 stocks were unchanged.
""Quite a blue chip rally,"" remarked portfolio manager Josef Schachter, head of Schachter Asset Management.
Schachter said investors concluded Canada's largest equities market had fallen enough in recent weeks to account for a 25-basis-point hike in U.S. short-term interest rates.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise rates at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday.
Investors are saying ""okay, we can get a quarter point, we can live on that,"" Schachter said.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 12 posted gains led by financial services, pipelines, consumer products and media.
The only two weak sectors were gold and real estate.
Bullion prices ended weaker on Monday with Comex April gold down US$2.60 at US$350.40 an ounce.
Hot stocks included Bre-X Minerals Ltd. which led heavy traders and closed up 0.50 at 15.70 on volume of six million shares.
The Calgary-based gold prospector on Monday defended the accuracy of assay results and resource calculations for the Busang gold find in Indonesia.
Doubts about the size of the discovery pushed Bre-X shares to a 52-week low of 14.25 on Friday.
In other Bre-X news, U.S. brokerage Lehman Brothers cut its rating on the stock to neutral from outperform.
Another active issue was forestry firm Avenor Inc., adding 1.45 to close at 24 on 567,000 shares.
Avenor said on Monday that it will refuse a merger proposal from Domtar Inc. and will instead focus on a merger with Repap Enterprises Inc.
But the Avenor/Repap deal was put in doubt on Monday after Canada's largest pension fund, Caisse de depot et placement, gave the deal a thumbs down. The Caisse holds a 10 percent stake in Avenor.
Repap fell 0.23 to close at 2.19 on 945,000 shares, while Domtar lost 0.15 to close at 11.45 on 136,000 shares.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index slipped 20.92 points to 6122.84. Trading was moderate at 93.6 million shares worth C$1.3 billion ($949 million).
""We react usually what happens to the U.S. maybe one day after,"" said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels. U.S. markets dipped yesterday after a widely expected quarter-point rise in the U.S. Fed Funds rate.
""People are worried that there will be a similar raising of rates in Canada,"" Meisels said.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes, 10 tumbled, led by the interest-sensitive banks and pipelines along with transportation and consumer products.
The strong groups were real estate, golds, utilities and industrial products.
Declining issues beat out advances almost two to one -- 639 to 348 -- while 269 traded flat.

Trading in Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X was halted all day on Wednesday.
Bre-X's partner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., based in New Orleans, said tests so far showed ""insignificant"" gold in what has been called the biggest gold find this century.
Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh said in a statement that ""there appears to be a strong possibility that the potential gold resources...have been overstated because of invalid samples and assaying of those samples.""

LydiaZajc,"Canada's largest stock market in Toronto posted its biggest intra-day drop in almost a decade on Thursday as shares in former market darling Bre-X Minerals Ltd. were hammered by investors.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index plummeted 191.21 points to 5931.63, the biggest loss since October 20, 1987, the day after so-called Black Monday when it lost 220.90 points.
Gold prospector Bre-X resumed trading late on Thursday, plunging C$13 to C$2.50 on eight million shares after the company said on Wednesday's its Busang gold find, once touted as the world's largest, may not be as rich as projected.
""It's pretty obvious that Bre-X blew a hole in the market,"" said John Ing president of Maison Placements Canada of Toronto. ""It's...the shock and the ripple effect of the Bre-X disaster.""
Investors unloaded their Bre-X shares after trading resumed Thursday afternoon, wiping C$3.12 billion ($2.26 million) from the company's market value. The stock was halted on Wednesday.
On Nasdaq, Bre-X shares plummeted $9-13/32 to $1-31/32 on trading of nearly 6.9 million shares.
Investors seemed unconvinced after Bre-X chief executive David Walsh declared he was confident of the company's reserve estimates for its discovery deep in Indonesia's jungle.
Bre-X's partner Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. said on Wednesday its preliminary studies showed the site turned up ""insignificant amounts of gold."" Bre-X has estimated the Busang deposit contains 71 million ounces of gold.
During the selloff, the Toronto Stock Exchange's computer systems were halted twice, forcing the market to close half an hour early due to ""technical difficulties,"" an official said.
Worries about other junior mining firms swept the market, sparking a massive retreat in the heavyweight gold sector.

The carnage also extended to New York's stock market, which lost 140.11 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close two percent lower at 6740.59.
Wall Street, already unsettled by fears that rising interest rates would end its bull run, was further hurt by news that Toronto was suffering its own difficulties with Bre-X, analysts said.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes finished lower, led by golds, banks and base metals.

LydiaZajc,"Toronto stocks sank to their lowest level in four months on Friday after unexpectedly high U.S. producer price data heightened fears of further U.S. interest rate hikes.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index plunged 106.47 points, or 1.84 percent, to end at 5683.64.

""People are finally doing a bit of panicking here,"" said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels.
The key index closed at its lowest point since December 6 when it dipped to 5672.21 points.
U.S. producer prices slipped 0.1 percent in March, but the core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, jumped 0.4 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an average increase of 0.1 percent in the core rate.
The data sparked fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates at a meeting in May, analysts said. Bank of Canada officials suggested on Thursday that the central bank was in no hurry to match the Fed's last rate hike in March.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices lost ground, led by golds, banks, media, consumer products and oils.
The key financial services group sank nearly 2.8 percent amid worries that higher interest rates would hurt profits.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index eased 4.31 points to close at 5679.33, down more than 10 percent since its life-time high of 6348.02 on March 11.
Turnover was thin with 63.6 million shares changing hands worth C$965.6 million ($689.7 million).
The TSE was restrained on Monday by a weak Canadian dollar which prompted concerns that the Bank of Canada may have to raise Canadian rates to prop up the currency, said Dunnery Best, Midland Walwyn's director of private client investing.
Canada's dollar closed at C$1.3994 (US$0.7145) on Monday after the central bank intervened to support the sagging unit.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recouped some of Friday's 148-point loss, rising 60.21 points to close at 6451.90 on Monday.
Fears of rising U.S. interest rates, which dragged North American markets lower last week, appear to have subsided, Best said.
""Has it run its course? I would say largely,"" he said.
Other stock analysts suggested the threat of higher U.S. rates is not over and they predicted the correction would resume.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, nine weak groups were led by gold, consumer products and real estate. Gainers included media, oils and base metals.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index soared 64.22 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 5743.55. On Monday, the index was down more than 10 percent since setting its lifetime high of 6348 points on March 11.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 135.26 points to close at 6587.16.
Toronto's gains were restrained by its heavyweight gold group, which dropped two percent on weak gold prices.
""We're just following the U.S. side. The U.S. side is very strong on consumer price index numbers,"" said Montreal-based analyst Bill Ram.
The U.S. Labor Department said on Tuesday the consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in March. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a gain of 0.2 percent.
The weaker numbers inspired investors to put aside fears of another U.S. rate move -- at least for a while, Ram said.

LydiaZajc,"The Vancouver Stock Exchange will become the first Canadian exchange to conduct trading at night, in order to tap budding interest from Asian investors.
The new after hours trading will begin on this Sunday, spokeswoman Joyce Courtney said on Friday.
The trading programme, called Vista, is intended to attract Asian market players just starting to trade when Vancouverites are winding down their work day, Courtney said.
The two-hour session will run from 6:30 to 8:30 Pacific time (1:30 a.m. to 3:30 a.m., GMT). It is officialy considered the beginning of the next day's regular trading session, despite the time gap, Courtney said.
Vancouver will start by offering 40 stocks ranging from Australian resource firms to Asian industrials, she said.
""Our purpose here is to attract additional business from Asia so we're looking, quite frankly, to get ... investment from Asia into these companies,"" Courtney said. ""It's an extension of a number of Asian-Pacific initiatives we've had under way,"" which included marketing trips.
Some Canadian brokerages will get involved. ""We don't have every single VSE member committed to the programme but we do have a kind of a critical mass to start the trading,"" Courtney said. Trading partners include Toronto-Dominion's discount service Green Line and Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion.
Overseas brokerages will also be able to participate. International brokerages can gain associate status through VSE members and trade using special Reuters and Bloomberg terminals, Courtney said.
As of yet none are confirmed but several have applied, she added.
Canadian brokerages seem to be approaching this development cautiously. Diane Ratte, Midland Walwyn Capital Inc's senior vice-president and director of equity trading, said the brokerage would not staff the new session. ""At the present time, no. We're going to sit back and see what happens.""
""I didn't get the impression that too many of the firms were going to be actively involved. I got the impression that most of the firms are going to take that attitude -- sit back and wait,"" Ratte said.
Courtney said the VSE is hoping for a low-key start but expects trading to build up. ""We're looking for a gradual evolution of this trading session.""

Toronto added to Wednesday's 55-point rally while investors took profits in New York after the Dow's 92-point gains, said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.
""That shows that the markets are very fragile,"" Beattie said. ""They (investors) want to take advantage of any strength to sell,"" she said.
Toronto was also buoyed by its heavyweight gold group which jumped nearly 2.2 percent, aided by firmer COMEX gold prices. The key June contract rose $1.00 to $344.30.
Ten of Toronto's 14 sub-indices posted gains, led by golds, transportation, forestry products and consumer products.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index climbed 55.27 points to close at 5789.82.
Trading was moderate with turnover of 78.9 million shares worth C$1.27 billion ($909 million).
""I think this surprised a few people,"" said ScotiaMcLeod senior vice-president Fred Ketchen. ""The overriding influence in the market is moving away from inflationary problems to satisfaction with earnings,"" he said.
Toronto and New York have corrected about 10 percent since mid-March amid fears of further U.S. interest rate hikes.
But investors have put those concerns aside as companies report stronger-than-expected earnings, Ketchen said.
Canadian steel maker Stelco Inc on Wednesday posted first quarter earnings of C$0.27 ($0.19) a share compared to C$0.13 ($0.09) a share in the same period a year ago.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 11 gained ground led by consumer products, banks and conglomerates. The three weak sectors were media, real estate and golds.

""They got a little nervous in New York and the investors ran for the sidelines,"" said ScotiaMcLeod's senior vice-president Fred Ketchen. ""That certainly spilled over into the Canadian market as well.""
Wall Street fell as investors reconsidered previous worries of U.S. interest rate hikes.
Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained about five percent last week and Toronto rose nearly 2.5 percent, investors decided to take Wall Street farther down, Ketchen said.
Eleven of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes dropped, led by consumer products, pipelines, conglomerates and retail. The firmer sectors were gold, transportation and forestry products.

LydiaZajc,"Sears Canada Inc, Canada's third largest department store chain, said on Monday that retail revenues could grow by 8.6 percent or more in 1997, after an unexpectedly small first-quarter loss.
""We're hoping to do as well or better than that,"" Chief Executive Paul Walters told reporters after the annual meeting. Sears, which is 55 percent-owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co, earlier reported a first-quarter loss of C$0.03 a share versus a loss of C$0.23 in the same period of 1996.
Wood Gundy retail analyst David Brodie, who had forecast a deeper loss of C$0.10 a share for Sears Canada in the traditionally weak sales quarter, called the results ""fantastic.""
Sears Canada said first-quarter retail revenues rose by 8.6 percent from a year ago, but it did not break out actual retail revenues. Consolidated revenues jumped to C$875.1 million from C$821.7 million.
Walters credited stronger consumer spending and increased advertising. ""Now is the time to step on the gas pedal and grow,"" he said.
Sears Canada also plans to spend C$300 million over three years to upgrade its 110 outlets, starting in Toronto.
Brodie said he would up his original 1997 profit estimate of C$0.70 by 10 cents or so. ""They're in a very good position to step on the accelerator,"" he said.
""I don't attribute it (the growth) to the demise of Eaton's,"" Brodie added.
Venerable Canadian retailer T Eaton Co Ltd declared it might close up to 31 of its 85 outlets after entering bankrupcty protection on February 27.
Walters also said Sears Canada had been eying the purchase of a handful of Eaton's outlets. ""We've identified stores that are of interest to us,"" he said, adding that Sears Canada had only considered only a few locations since it already had competing stores in the same areas.
Despite rumors that Canadian retailers may band together and snap up Eaton's outlets, Brodie said it was more likely that a U.S. company would acquire parts of the 127-year-old, family-owned Eaton's chain.
But no matter how many Eaton's stores will be shuttered, Sears Canada will pick up about 20 percent of their sales, or its portion of Canadian market share, Walters noted.
Sears Canada shares rose 0.25 to 14 in Toronto on Monday.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index edged up 0.30 points to close at 5835.61. Turnover was moderate at 76.14 million shares worth C$1.05 billion (US$750 million).
""New York doesn't have quite the resources weight to pull them south like Toronto does,"" said Dunnery Best, Midland Walwyn's director of private client investing.
""New York is still being driven ahead by technologies and the wave of good earnings,"" he said.
Canada's largest stock market was also hurt by concern over a weakening currency, Best said.
The dollar ended softer on Monday at C$1.4000 (US$0.7140) from Friday's close of C$1.3970 (US$0.7158) on fears that the Bank of Canada may have to raise short-term interest rates to defend the currency during the Canadian election campaign.
Foreign investors were worried that political rhetoric over Quebec's separatist movement may heat up over the next few weeks, Best said.
Bank stocks, which have attracted foreign investors in recent months, lost ground on Monday.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, six fell led by financial services, transportation, oils, and pipelines. Gaining groups included conglomerates, real estate and media.

"
LydiaZajc,"Investors cheered Hudson's Bay Co's naming on Monday of a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc official as chief executive, saying he would bring Wal-Mart's retailing savvy to Canada's biggest department store chain.
William Fields replaces retiring Chief Executive George Kosich on June 1. Hudson's Bay shares closed up 0.90 to 27.40 today on the Toronto Stock Exchange after the news.
Fields was most recently chief executive of Blockbuster Entertainment Group, a unit of Viacom Inc. He resigned by mutual agreement on April 22 after Viacom said that its movie rental unit's first quarter would fall short of year earlier performance by 15 to 20 percent.
He was chief executive from 1995 to 1996 of the stores unit of Wal-Mart, the largest U.S. retailer, capping a 25-year career at Wal-Mart in which he began as a store manager.
Hudson's Bay hired another former Wal-Mart executive, Millard Barron, last autumn to head its discount department chain Zellers. The 327-year-old retailer also runs a more upscale chain, the Bay.
""Having two of them, who understand the Wal-Mart way of doing things...will certainly give Hudson's Bay an advantage in adopting the new merchandising and marketing techniques,"" said analyst Leonard Kubas, president of Leonard Kubas Consultants.
""You've brought in two senior execs from, I guess, the most successful non-food retailer in the U.S,"" said an analyst, who requested anonymity, adding that ""clearly it is a positive development for the company.""
Wal-Mart, which came to Canada in 1994, has ousted Zellers as Canada's top discount store chain and brought everyday low pricing to Canadian consumers.
Fields told Reuters in a telephone interview that he was considering ways of battling his former employer.
""I do have some ideas, but I think the first thing I need to do is understand more about the Canadian consumer and the Canadian market place and maybe at least have a week before I come up with a strategy.""
Fields added that he would likely bring some of Wal-Mart's culture to Hudson's Bay.
""The principles that Sam Walton established are pretty ingrained in me, so I think it would be hard to separate the two,"" he said.

Earnings euphoria swept aside earlier inflation fears after the U.S. government released unexpectedly strong gross domestic product figures. GDP rose 5.6 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter, compared to economists' forecasts of 4.1 percent.
Ketchen said that investors are awaiting Friday's U.S. employment numbers for more direction on inflation and whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to hike short-term interest rates.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by conlomerates, consumer products, transportation and base metals.
Gaining issues beat decliners 593 to 366, while 301 traded flat.
In individual issues, Shell Canada Ltd. soared 3.90 to 57.40. The energy company said first quarter earnings rose to C$1.35 from a year-earlier C$0.87 and that it plans to buy back 14 percent of its Class A common shares.    Conglomerate Brascan
Ltd. jumped 3.15 to 33.90 in heavy trading after news that it was set to merge with financial management firm Edper Group Ltd.
Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd. topped Toronto's most active stocks, dropping 0.32 to 3.48. The gold prospector said on Wednesday that its partner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., extended its due diligence review of the controversial Busang gold project in Indonesia to June 30.

LydiaZajc,"Toronto stocks extended their winning streak to end higher on Thursday, powered by surging banks as fears of a Canadian interest rate hike eased.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 33.27 points to 6009.90. Trading was heavy at 95.3 million shares worth C$1.7 billion ($1.2 billion).
In the past three sessions, Canada's largest market jumped by more than 2.5 percent.
Banks led 12 of Toronto's 14 sub-indices to higher ground, rising almost 1.8 percent as investors put aside worries that Canada would raise interest rates to match U.S. hikes.
Investment advisor Ira Katzin with RBC Dominion Securities said: ""Financial services benefited from the expectations that interest rates would stay stable or ease off a bit.""
But market watchers were eying Friday's U.S. employment data, Katzin said.
The numbers could provide more indication of whether U.S. inflation was on the rise, which could prompt rate hikes by U.S. and Canadian central banks.
The U.S. government will report April's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate.
Toronto's stronger sub-sectors included media, pipelines and real estate, while conglomerates and forestry products fell.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 500 to 447 and 301 were flat.
In active issues, gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. lost 0.44 to 3.04 in heavy dealings. Investors continued to consider the worth of its controversial Busang project in Indonesia.
Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's largest bank, rose 1.35 to 57.20 and third-ranked Bank of Montreal also rose 1.35 to 52.05.

LydiaZajc,"Toronto's key stock index rocketed almost 100 points higher on Friday as earnings euphoria soared and fears of a U.S. interest rate hike waned.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index climbed 97.01 points to 6106.91 and extended its winning streak to a fourth day.
Trading in Canada's largest equities market totaled 109 million shares worth C$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion).
""All of a sudden people are coming back to rational expectations,"" said Calgary, Alberta-based portfolio manager Josef Schachter. ""Earnings have been fantastic.""
Stock market gains in Toronto and New York were also powered by news of a long-awaited agreement between the White House and congressional Republican leaders to balance the U.S. budget, Schachter said.
A balanced U.S. budget means the government will offer fewer bonds, boosting demand and prices for fixed income instruments and reducing yields.
There were also growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not hike interest rates at its May 20 meeting since this week's U.S. economic data pointed to minimal inflation growth.
This week, Toronto's key index jumped by almost five percent as strong corporate earnings rolled in.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 12 rose on Friday, including media, utilities, consumer products and banks. Real estate and gold groups slipped.
Advancing issues led decliners 616 to 358, while 254 were unchanged.
In individual issues, telecommunications conglomerate BCE Inc. jumped 4.20 to 69.95. Cable and telephone companies were active after the federal Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on Thursday threw the country's local telephone market open to competition.
The government telecommunications watchdog also came out in favor of convergence between the phone and cable television broadcast industries.
Bank of Montreal, Canada's third largest, jumped 1.70 to 53.75, leading interest-sensitive banks.

LydiaZajc,"Canadian grocery chain Loblaw Cos Ltd is set to see earnings per share soar by 50 percent by 2000 as sales grow, President Richard Currie said on Friday.
""Earnings per share will jump about 50 percent over the next three years,"" Currie told the annual meeting. First- quarter profit rose to C$0.15 a share for the period ended March 22 from year earlier C$0.12.
Currie also told shareholders that 1997 earnings per share would rise to C$0.85 to C$0.89, the range of predictions by analysts. ""My expectations are (that) the analysts are about correct,"" he said.
Last year, Loblaw, which is 70 percent-owned by bakery group George Weston Ltd, earned C$0.72 a share or C$173.7 million on sales of C$9.85 billion.
Currie forecast 1997 sales would expand by 10 percent. ""Sales have been very solid, up seven percent last year, and with this year being a 53-week year, it might hit to 10 percent,"" Currie added. ""That would represent a stellar year.""
Loblaw ended its previous fiscal year in December 28 but because it reports in 12-week increments, it must add a few days this year.
""The earnings have a potential to increase more if we can get our costs down to where they could be,"" Currie said. In 1996, Loblaw streamlined warehousing and distribution systems.
Loblaw, which owns retail and wholesale stores including Loblaws, Valu-Mart, Extra Foods and Lucky Dollar Foods, has seen sales grow steadily over the past few years as it expanded in Atlantic Canada and other regions.
The grocer plans to unveil its first Quebec stores, outside of its outlets in the Ottawa/Hull region, in late 1997 or early 1998.
Loblaw has also benefited from the strike of unionized workers at 73 Safeway Inc stores in Alberta, which began on March 26, Currie added. Loblaw sales have jumped 30 percent in the province.
Safeway is based in Pleasanton, California.
Currie said Loblaw would have C$450 million in capital expenditures in 1997, up from about C$350 million in 1996. He said Loblaw planned to open or renovate 64 outlets.
Loblaw shares edged up 0.05 to 17.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange today, below its 52-week high of 17.60 and well above its year low of 10.40.
George Weston shares rose 0.50 to 78 in Toronto.

LynneO'Donnell,"China's aluminium can makers are facing a tough year in 1997 as surging world metal prices force costs up while domestic Chinese demand has yet to catch up with capacity, industry experts said on Wednesday.
Profit margins for manufacturers in China of aluminium beverage cans have fallen over the past couple of years, Western and Chinese industry sources said.
Now that aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) are at their highest point in more than a year, China's can makers are facing a further squeeze on profits, sources said.
""The wholesale price of an aluminium can is about one yuan (12 U.S. cents), which leaves around 0.1 yuan profit,"" an official with the China Packaging Technology Association, an industry body with interests in domestic can makers, said.
""Competition in the industry is so severe that any factory with capacity of 600,000 cans or less faces bankruptcy,"" the official said by telephone from Beijing.
He suggested the central government was considering lowering the import duty on aluminium, currently 15 percent, in order to help the industry.
This could not be immediately confirmed, though industry sources said they had been lobbying for the cuts.
One senior industry executive described current aluminium can prices as ""below sustainable levels"".
But with demand for canned beverages growing by anything up to 30 percent a year, the long-term outlook is the key, industry sources said.
""Prices are generally below what we would like to see -- it is a case of waiting for demand to catch up with capacity,"" said Terry Cartwright, managing director of Crown Can Hong Kong Ltd.
Crown Can has four plants in China and one in Hong Kong with total capacity of two billion cans a year, which will hit 2.5 billion in 1998 on current expansion, Cartwright said.
""In the long-term, China is an important market and strategically, can makers need to be in China,"" he said.
""But it is going to be tough in the short term, particularly as aluminium prices on the LME are so high,"" Cartwright said.
The rises on the LME have been fuelled by speculative fund buying, pushing prices up on Tuesday to $1,701 a tonne.
This was the highest price in 14 months, up $11 from Monday and some $150 above the levels prevailing at the start of 1997.
But it is a cost can makers in China cannot avoid, sources said, as local aluminium does not meet quality standards.
According to the China Packaging Technology Association, China's current installed can-making capacity is 10 billion cans a year. This figure is seen rising shortly to 13 billion cans a year, the spokesman said.
Demand in China is rising by about one billion cans a year, and in 1996 was five billion cans, the official said.
Current output consumes about 85,000 tonnes of refined aluminium a year, industry sources have said.
Capacity has soared in recent years because of tax rules that allowed manufacturers to import capital equipment duty free until late last year, and in some cases to the middle of 1997.
""It is true that people were perhaps pulling forward their expansion plans ahead of the imposition of duty, and that is what accounts for the increase in investment in the can making industry in China,"" another Western industry source said.
""But there has been tremendous investment in the soft drinks industry in China. It has gone up dramatically and that will certainly be matched by investment in the can-making industry in the long term,"" he said.

LynneO'Donnell,"Tin production at one of China's biggest mines has been cut by summer flooding, but a lacklustre market means business has not been affected, an executive with Deng's Yunnan Tin Corp said on Monday.
Gejiu Tin Mine in southern Yunnan province was damaged by floods in June and July, deputy general manager Sheng Weichung told Reuters.
Deng's Yunnan Tin Corp is the Hong Kong representative and trading arm of Yunnan Tin Corp, China's biggest tin producer.  
In 1995, Sheng said, Yunnan Tin Corp produced 20,000 tonnes of tin. The Gejiu mine was the company's biggest, he said.
""But business has been slow in China because the world market is soft and because of domestic restructuring of the industry, changes in government policy and tight credit,"" Sheng said. ""So a cut in production at the Gejiu mine would not have any adverse affect on China's overall tin industry picture.""
It was unclear how extensive the damage to the mine was, he said, or by how much production had been cut.  
China expected to produce 45,000 tonnes of tin in 1996, an official of the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp said in July.
He forecast 1996 exports of 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes.
Total 1995 tin exports were 43,307 tonnes, down 2.4 percent on the year before, China's State Statistical Bureau reported.
Total Chinese tin production for the first half of 1996 was down 6.14 percent on the same 1995 period, to 25,944 tonnes, the figures show.  
Exports for the first half of 1996 of unwrought tin and tin alloys were 12,867 tonnes, down 27 percent on the first half of 1995, customs figures show.
Tin exports in June were 3,339 tonnes.
Despite its size and the high quality of its product, Yunnan Tin Corp was still a ""loss-making state enterprise"" and as such was facing tough times, Sheng said.
A labour force of 100,000 had been cut within the past two years to 40,000 with the introduction of a redundancy programme that offered lump sum payments, he said.  
Senior management had also been trying to raise capital abroad to help get expansion projects off the ground, he said.
Other metals markets in China continued slow, traders said.
A return to pre-summer volatility that saw London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices fluctuate sharply throughout last week would keep China business slow, traders said.
Three month copper values on the LME traded between $1,905 and $1,970 a tonne in the July 30-August 29 period, giving traders some hope that calm had returned to the market after Sumitomo Corp revealed in June it had lost US$1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised trading.  
But the calm was shortlived. On September 2, copper prices spiked to a 2-1/2 month high of $2,195, before slumping back on Friday to $1,915.
""I think the market will go down again,"" a trader in Singapore said.
A lack of buyers for Chinese aluminium products had led to domestic stockbuilding, trading sources said.
""They are in the market to export, but there is no real market for them...we are not touching it,"" another source said.
Singapore premiums for zinc were firm at around $65-70 over the LME cash price, traders said.  
Another source added the only zinc available for trading in Singapore was Chinese, ""and the Chinese are working on a fixed price basis"" of around $1,080 to $1,120 a tonne.
Three month LME zinc closed six dollars down on Friday at $1,034 a tonne.

LynneO'Donnell,"Indium, one of the few minor metals to survive the end of the Cold War with demand intact, is now in short supply as Chinese producers have either oversold or are hoarding stocks as prices soar, traders said on Friday.
Traders in China and Japan, the world's biggest consumer of indium, said Chinese producers seemed unwilling to sell at current prices, instead waiting for further rises.
Indium, a by-product of zinc, is used in the manufacture of semi-conductors and liquid crystal displays (LCD).
China is Asia's biggest producer, according to one trading source.
Japan uses about two-thirds of annual world supply, with 80 percent of that used to make LCDs, a Tokyo market source said.
Japanese consumption slumped 38 percent in 1996 to 43.5 tonnes, pressuring on prices, he said.
But with an improved economic outlook and a revival in the high-end electronics industry, indium demand is picking up and world supply is tightening.
Figures for China's annual output are not available. One trader said it is not a major world supplier of indium but in a tight market its output counted.
""Chinese producers have sold out, in effect they have oversold, so I don't think we will see anything available before late April/early May,"" a Chinese trader in Beijing said.
""Chinese producers are now looking for $290 a kg,"" on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, he said.
The price for 99.99 percent indium ingot was quoted in Rotterdam last week at $220/250 a kg.
Chinese indium is arriving in Japan at $280-300 a kg, inclusive of cost, insurance and freight (CIF), the Tokyo trader said.
Far East traders said they have been waiting for spot prices for indium to hit $300 a kg, as there was no perceptible pickup in Chinese production after the Lunar New Year holiday in February.
A European source in Hong Kong said he recently bought a few hundred kg of indium in the belief that prices are on their way back up to the levels of two years ago, close to $500 a kg.
""The market has seen those levels before and is not afraid of them,"" he said.
The Chinese trading source said that Chinese factories were now shipping against old contracts but were asking for a premium over the contracted price.
Other traders said long-term contracts were being delayed, with some reporting that Chinese suppliers were attempting to re-negotiate prices.
Some suppliers were also reneging, they said.
""We have had that experience,"" a source at a Western company said.
""So in this atmosphere people are very wary and we are still pushing for our own deliveries,"" he said.
Another Chinese trader said there were sources of indium in China and Hong Kong but these were unlikely to seep into the market until prices firmed more dramatically.
""When the price rose to $400-500 a kg in 1995, a lot of Chinese companies were thinking it would go as high as $700 and they bought a lot of material at $400,"" the source said.
""Some of them are still holding, waiting for the price to go up again so they can clear their books,"" he said.
""So there is material and we will see some come out but there won't be a flood because producers have oversold, they will want to clear their old contracts first.
""In the meantime, there are a lot of people knocking on our door looking for indium,"" he said.

LynneO'Donnell,"Chinese copper producers could soon start selling their red metal to take advantage of current high prices -- and before a long-awaited correction hits the international market, Chinese traders said on Friday.
London Metal Exchange (LME) copper, currently hovering close to its highest price in almost a year, is ready for a correction and Chinese producers want to get what they can before the price fall begins, a Shanghai copper trader said.
""Chinese producers have begun to sell domestically at these prices because they don't believe they will last,"" he said.
Prices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME), which often move in tandem with the LME, rose on Friday morning, in what one trading source in the city said was a reflection of local fundamentals.
""Once the local selling becomes a factor here, the price in Shanghai will correct,"" he said.
Shanghai copper futures opened mostly up on Friday. The most active June 1996 contract opened at 23,650 yuan ($2,851) per tonne, up 300 yuan from Thursday's close. It moved around that level early in the session.
Traders on the SME said copper was likely to consolidate in a range of 23,000 to 24,000 yuan ($2,771-2,891) in the short term with buyers and sellers having mixed views over its direction.
LME copper see-sawed in trade on Thursday, breaching the $2,400 resistance level at the afternoon kerb. It closed at $2,403 per tonne, up $28 on the day, after fund buying at the midday dips spurred the price up.
Shanghai traders said they expected the funds to begin selling, bringing the correction with them in the process.
Traders and analysts here have said the LME copper price is not supported by fundamentals and that the market is waiting for Chinese buying to begin.
China's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, according to State Statistical Bureau figures. Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.
Chinese media reported in January that China's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes. Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes.
Copper imports are expected to remain high, media reports have said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent to 714,248 tonnes.
Western traders and those elsewhere in the region agreed China needed to buy copper, but those polled by Reuters were unanimous that China appeared to be holding off on its buying programme while prices remained high.
But Chinese buyers are not known for entering the market at the bottom of a correction, instead, they are likely to wait for prices to rise again before coming in, Shanghai traders said.
""I think $2,100 to $2,200 (per tonne on the LME) would be a good price because China will need to buy, they are short of copper every year,"" said an executive in Shanghai with a European metal producer.
She said the crackdown on scrap imports, part of China's campaign last year against the import of foreign garbage, would lead to a rise in Chinese need for cathode.
""Domestic prices are still moving up, I guess because stocks are getting low,"" she said. ""They will have to buy eventually.""
Figures released last Friday by the SME show exchange warehouse copper stocks at 23,407 tonnes.
But local traders have said this figure has barely changed in recent months and the big question is the tonnage off-warrant, that is, the amount of copper not registered on the exchange but still available to the market.

LynneO'Donnell,"Sky-high world copper prices do not seem to be supported by fundamentals and could soon be in for a liquidation-related correction, Chinese copper trading sources said on Monday.
""I don't really see any support for $2,400,"" a Chinese source on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) said.
""If the price can go above $2,400 a tonne and stay up there for a decent period, that would indicate some support,"" he said. ""But I think the funds are under pressure to sell.""
London Metal Exchange (LME) copper came under heavy pressure from liquidation and end-week sales on Friday after surging to a nine-month high of $2,445 a tonne.
The market fell back to close Friday's kerb at $2,390, a $13 fall on Thursday's close.
Shanghai copper futures ended down across the board on Monday on heavy profit-taking, with the most active June 1997 contract ending at 23,370 yuan ($2,817), losing 50 yuan.
Traders said the correction came on the back of the LME's Friday falls.
The SME trading source said he would sell at 23,300 yuan per tonne. Monday's intra-day low was 23,200 yuan and he saw it going down further this week to 22,800.
LME copper appeared set to test the downside on Monday, with the first support level at $2,350, London analysts said.
This had the support of Chinese traders, one of whom said from the southern Zhuhai Special Economic Zone that LME copper prices should consolidate around $2,320-2,380.
He and others ruled out Chinese activity in the immediate term, saying prices were still too high to justify buying.
The official China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday that China's demand for copper would reach 1.2 million tonnes in 1997.
China's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, according to State Statistical Bureau figures.
Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.
Copper imports are expected to remain high, media reports have said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-8544

LynneO'Donnell,"The jump in London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc prices to a 4-1/2 year high, as yet, threatens no flood of Chinese metal onto the market, but producers are sitting on a windfall, traders said on Monday.
The main flow of Chinese zinc exports is currently headed for Japan attracted by its preferential duty free policy for metal imports from developing countries up until April 1, a trader with a European firm in Hong Kong said.
""Chinese zinc is very tight otherwise and you won't see any indications for a while,"" she said.  
LME three-month zinc touched a 4-1/2 year high of $1,266 a tonne on Friday, before a slight fall back to close at $1,254, up $12.
Far East metal traders and producer representatives in the region agreed the metal has yet to hit its peak, with some expecting a consolidation around $1,240 and others predicting a push towards $1,350 before a consolidation.
Official China customs figures show China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in January, 1997 reached 30,914 tonnes, up 100.3 percent compared to the year-ago period.  
Exports were boosted by high LME prices and a reduction in a Chinese export tax on the metal from five percent in 1996 to nil this year, boosting the value of domestic zinc by $50 a tonne.
""This year should be an historic year for Chinese zinc metal exports -- if the price stays high,"" a Beijing dealer said.
He said he believed total Chinese zinc exports would hit 80,000 tonnes for January and February 1997, and possibly half a million tonnes for the whole year.
China exported a total of 226,777 tonnes of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in 1996, up 18.4 percent on 1995, the customs figures show.  
But an executive with a Western producer that supplies to the region said he had so far seen no evidence of increased Chinese zinc sales to the Asian market.
""The supply and demand fundamentals on physical metal are improving as far as expectations of price hikes and continued support go,"" he said. This would see prices firm further.
""I am telling my customers that it is best for them to place their orders as soon as possible, as the trend is rising and we don't know where it will go,"" the representative for a major North American producer said.  
LME zinc could probably move up at least another $100 a tonne and this would see premiums start to soften as producers and sellers tried to compete, he said.
Traders pegged current CIF special high grade zinc premiums in Hong Kong at $130 a tonne over the LME cash price and high grade at $120 a tonne.
The Beijing trader said Chinese smetlers were selling at a $40 premium FOB Chinese ports. High grade was selling at a discount of $25 a tonne, he said.  
""I think LME zinc will be volatile,"" he said. ""Some people were saying last year they thought it would go to $1,400 but I wouldn't be so bullish.""

LynneO'Donnell,"China's corn exports have taken the world market by surprise and could double from current sales levels to more than two million tonnes for the year, Far East grain traders said on Tuesday.
""Just based on done business, it sounds like their programme is big,"" a Singapore-based trader said of China's corn exports.
A trader in Seoul said China's corn sales to South Korea alone since the start of 1997 were 690,500 tonnes and could hit 1.5 million tonnes for the year.
Other spot sales to Southeast Asia brought the total so far close to 1.5 million tonnes, the Singapore source said, including 600,000-700,000 tonnes of optional sales he said would probably be Chinese product.
Japan had yet to buy, traders said, having been badly scorched after China banned corn exports in December 1994 and reneged on some contracted sales.
Traders in the South Korean capital said on Tuesday a group of local feed milling companies called the Top Margin Committee bought a total of 126,500 tonnes of Chinese corn late on Monday.
Sale prices of $140.95 and $142.90 per tonne inclusive of cost and freight (c&amp;f) indicated a free on board (FOB) price of $130-132 per tonne, with freight between northern China and South Korea about $10 a tonne.
This indicated a slight discount, of $2 to $3 a tonne, from the original Chinese asking price of $135 a tonne, a trader whose company represents Beijing's food trading arm COFCO, said.
A trader with a major South Korean feed mill company said one of its suppliers could come up with another 750,000 tonnes of Chinese corn.
That some of the South Korean purchases have been for August and September delivery indicated China was in the middle of a major corn export programme that could total two million or more tonnes for the year, traders throughout the region said.
Trade and industry sources have long said that corn stored in the northern port of Dalian, where it is priced and loaded for export, tops two million tonnes.
China's 1996 corn harvest was a record 118 million tonnes, official figures show.
In the same year, China imported 440,000 tonnes of corn, down 91.4 percent on 1995, while it exported 160,000 tonnes, up 40.9 percent.
While traders in the Far East said they were taken by surprise at the volumes of corn moving out of China, the impact on world corn prices was limited because some level of activity had been anticipated since last November.
Traders began 1997 with figures of 300,000 tonnes of total Chinese corn exports. As exports began to soar, traders and other experts started favouring levels closer to a million tonnes.
As one source said on Tuesday: ""We're revising our numbers every day. Last week we said a million. This week it's two.""
Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) closed 1-1/2 to six cents per bushel higher in Monday trade, with the March contract hitting a 5-1/2-month high, up six at $3.12.
An industry executive in Singapore said the Chinese sales had already been factored into the CBOT price, while prices in Tokyo and Chicago were driven by less fundamental and more speculative activity. -- Shanghai newsoom (86-21) 6279-8544

LynneO'Donnell,"China is unlikely to take delivery of Thai sugar bought in the past month because import licences have not been issued to Chinese buyers and local prices are too low to make imports viable, traders said on Wednesday.
""People got excited, but China is not importing sugar,"" a trader with a big U.S. house in Hong Kong said.
Sugar cannot be imported to China without a licence.
""There are no import licences at all being issued, it is all in the hands of (Beijing's central food trading arm) Ceroils. Prices are still pretty low, so I don't see any movement on imports,"" the bank source said from Hong Kong.
Since February, China has reportedly bought four cargoes of Thai raw sugar for tolling, or processing and re-exporting, traders said.
But a trader with a European bank said the Chinese purchases had been overstated by two-thirds and in fact stood at 25,000 tonnes bought on licence.
The licence had been issued to the local government in China's Himalayan region of Tibet.
Other traders also had mentioned the Tibetan import licence for 25,000 tonnes of sugar, issued in order to allow the government of the impoverished region to sell the commodity on the local market and make some money. This could not be officially confirmed.
Thai raw sugar premiums have firmed recently on the news of China's purchases, and traders throughout the region were caught out, having predicted China would not import sugar until the second half of 1997 when traditional market shortages would begin to bite.
Far East traders had said they did not expect to see China buying sugar on the international market before then. Some sources questioned whether China would import at all this year.
Recent buying by central authorities from Guangxi, China's major production area, would have boosted central government reserves, probably to about 10 percent of annual consumption, or 700,000 tonnes, one trading source said.
This could be released onto the market if prices, currently around 3,900 yuan per tonne, go up to 4,500 yuan which is unlikely before August/September, he said.
Some industry sources were sounding smug on Wednesday, having done their sums and seen that even importing at good prices was not an economical option for Chinese buyers currently.
Imported sugar is subject to 12 percent import duty and 17 percent value-added tax, which would be added to the cost of the Thai raws of $250 a tonne, plus a $30 a tonne premium, the trading source said.
Processing would push cost per tonne to above 4,000 yuan in a climate where market prices are below that, the head of a joint venture processor in Gaungxi said.
""If they can import and toll and sell for 4,200 then they can buy back some sugar at the current levels and then they can still make a margin and a little profit,"" he said.
""But at the moment, the price is not high, so how can they make money?"" he said.
With the sugar cane crushing season in full swing, Chinese markets are flush with processed sugar and prices have been soft for some months.
Wholesale sugar prices in the southern growing regions have yet to reach break-even levels for the factories, the Guangxi joint venture manager said.
Ex-factory prices in Gaungxi were seen at 3,950-3,980 yuan ($476-469) per tonne. Break-even is above 4,000 yuan.
""There is an upward trend and hope is on the horizon,"" the manager said, adding he expected sugar prices to move to 4,000-4,100 yuan ($482-494) a tonne within the next 30 days.
Prices were likely to stabilise at that level before shortages kicked in around August and September, he said.

LynneO'Donnell,"China could be sitting on ample copper supplies to get it through the next few months, wiping out the need to buy on the world market whether current high prices fall or not, traders and analysts said on Thursday.
Copper stored in Shanghai warehouses could be around 100,000 tonnes if talk is to be believed, a Chinese trader with a Beijing-run firm in Singapore said.
Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) warehouse figures released last week put copper stocks at 16,772 tonnes, which a SME copper futures trader told Reuters was about two months' supply.
Another Chinese trading source said he had confirmed with sources at the Chinese State Reserve Bureau that Shanghai warehouses held 80,000 tonnes of central reserve copper.
The market has been plagued in the past year by talk of 100,000 tonnes of copper being held in Shanghai. Officials have consistently denied any knowledge of such a stockpile.
That copper and another 200,000 tonnes were reported to have been channeled into China after last year's revelations by Japan's Sumitomo Corp of $2.6 billion in copper trading losses, which led to significant price falls.
Many market and industry sources said at the time that the copper, moved out of bonded warehouses and through customs in October and November 1996, was bought by Beijing's metals trading arm China National Non-ferrous Metals Import/Export Corp, possibly in conjunction with Sumitomo.
Neither corporation has made an official comment.
Analysts with private think tank Shanghai Colub Consultant Co have said China's carryover copper stocks from 1996 imports could be as high as 250,000 tonnes.
The official China Daily Business Weekly said last Sunday that China amassed a stockpile in 1996 of 170,000 tonnes of copper which would be used to fill the domestic supply/demand gap in 1997.
It put 1997 imports at more than 130,000 tonnes, for demand of 1.2 million tonnes and production of about 900,000 tonnes.
Imports in 1996 of raw and uncast copper were up 32.7 percent to 714,248 tonnes, according to official figures. Exports were 133,700 tonnes, leaving net imports at 580,600 tonnes, the figures show.
""I'm convinced they have enough (copper),"" a trader with a major European firm said.
""Everyone has been waiting since Chinese New Year for this huge Chinese buying spree... it is possible there are tens of thousands of tonnes of copper there,"" he said.
Whether or not the red metal is moving into tight supply in China -- as some traders looking at falling SME prices believe -- few traders polled by Reuters see Chinese buying at current prices.
London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices dipped slightly in inter-office trading late on Wednesday after putting in a weak performance in ring activity. At 1900 GMT three month prices were indicated at $2,330/4 per tonne, down from a kerb close of $2,338.
London analysts said they saw copper testing the $2,313 support level in the near term.
""My (Chinese) customers are telling me they would rather close their factories than buy at these levels,"" said Vinod Kumar, general manager of Singapore trading house Donald Macarthy.
""They can't make any money if they buy above $2,200 (per tonne),"" Kumar said by telephone.
Other trading sources in the region and in China put prices favourable to Chinese importers at $2,000 to $2,300 per tonne.

LynneO'Donnell,"China's flagship futures bourse, the Shanghai Metal Exchange, has ambitions to become Asia's premier metals trading floor, but economic realities are holding it back, the exchange's president said on Friday.
Total turnover since the exchange opened in May 1992 has topped 180 billion yuan ($21 billion) and efforts at regulation have curbed speculation, Hu Yuezheng said in an interview.
The exchange's 120 members include China's biggest base metals producers. All of them, along with the central government, now use the exchange's prices to monitor the market, Hu told Reuters.
Measures introduced in 1994 and 1995 to reduce speculation on the exchange had cut turnover to 230 billion yuan last year, from 455.8 billion yuan in 1995, Hu said.
But the introduction of several major regulations would see 1997 turnover expand on the 1996 figure, he said, but refused to make any projections.
Although greater market regulation has boosted its credibility, the Shanghai Metal Exchange still remains a long way from a place on the world trading stage, Hu said.
International metals trade is conducted in U.S. dollars, but China's yuan is not fully convertible, he said. Foreign investors are also not allowed to trade on China's futures exchanges.
China has no securities law and the quality of Chinese product lagged far behind world standards, he added.
But Hu said: ""It is of course my hope"" that Shanghai will become the East Asian equivalent to the London Metal Exchange (LME). Sipping tea from a Chicago Mercantile Exchange mug, Hu listed the market's current regulations, including margin requirements, limit up and limit down, daily clearance, and strict payment and delivery rules.
Limit up and limit down rules, designed to minimise risk, covered three trading days, Hu said, after which traders suffering losses of more than six percent were required to enter their losses in the exchange computer so they could be offset against gains.
""On day one, the limit is three percent, on day two it is four percent and margin requirements are then increased from five (percent) to six percent,"" he said.
""If it is still limit up by day three, the limit increases to five percent and the margin requirement increases to eight percent,"" he said.
Speculators would then be required to offset their positions, he said. And if there were no speculators, then hedgers would be required to do so.
""Why did we do it like this? Because over the past few years we have had many speculators here trying to squeeze the market and in this way we have brought some stability to the market, and our members feel their interests are protected,"" Hu said.
Up to 20 percent of the exchange's total turnover was now generated by producer and consumer hedging, he said.
While prices on the exchange are often move in tandem with those on the LME, Hu said Shanghai price levels increasingly reflected local fundamentals.
""At the moment there is no real relationship between the two exchanges,"" he said. ""China's rapid economic development has seen copper demand grow and now the country must import 30 percent of its needs, now around 1.1 million tonnes a year.""
""This need is what influences international prices,"" he said.
""There will always be contradictions between activity and regulation, but we feel it is more important to have a regulated market,"" he said.

LynneO'Donnell,"Far East metals traders said on Monday they were bearish about China's short term role in the world copper market, but conflicting signals from Chinese traders and industry officials added to prevailing confusion.
Talk has been swirling through China's domestic markets since the middle of last week that copper traders on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) had been told not to sell their red metal to prevent price falls.  
Trading sources in Shanghai told Reuters at the same time that an official directive along these lines had been issued after an industry seminar in Beijing.
Shanghai copper futures opened higher on Monday on the reports, with local dealers saying the seminar had also resulted in a request that traders suspend imports and hold their own positions to prop-up prices and help loss-making state mines.
The SME's most active June contract opened at 23,800 yuan ($2,867) a tonne, up 130 yuan, before advancing further to hit a peak of 24,320 yuan.  
An official of the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) said no directives had been issued after the seminar to suspend copper imports or to order traders not to sell their copper to hold-up prices.
But the official said the firm, which is responsible for China's copper trade, had last week recommended traders hold their positions to wait for further price rises. This week he said the firm was urging traders to sell because prices were seen as favourable.  
""China at the end of the day is a net importer (of copper) and if they are talking about stopping imports you've got to believe that there is enough available on the domestic market for the time being,"" a Singapore trader said.
""If they are halting imports, that can be nothing but bearish,"" he said. ""If they're not allowed to sell, that can be nothing but bearish.
""If this is indeed the case, the LME (London Metal Exchange) will come off, and you'll be sitting there with this huge arbitrage, which I cannot believe the Chinese traders will ignore,"" he said.  
Sources in Shanghai say warehouses in the city hold 80,000 tonnes of copper that would be available to the market.
""So there is no need to buy right now -- and if there is no buying (imports) then the Shanghai price will go up,"" said a local trader, adding he thought the SME price would hit 25,000 yuan per tonne in the short term.
Western traders said that if Chinese buying does not soon start in earnest -- as has been expected since Chinese New Year in February and more so as the peak summer consumption period looms -- then LME copper price would tumble.  
China's imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent to 714,248 tonnes, official figures show. Exports were 133,700 tonnes, leaving net imports at 580,600 tonnes.
China's copper mines are not believed to be losing money, as production costs in China are lower than in most places in the world, and current LME prices are almost twice Western production costs, trading sources said.
Another source said the emphasis of China's copper imports had shifted from refined copper to concentrate so smelters can produce their own end product for the domestic market.

LynneO'Donnell,"World zinc prices that have risen to levels not seen for more than four years are good for Chinese zinc producers who will gear up output to take advantage of the hikes, producing and trading sources said on Tuesday.
While many Chinese producers have sold out of their metal, output would be boosted from April, said a source at the Zhuzhou smelter, one of China's major producers in Hunan province.
Zhuzhou's exports for the first three months of 1997 would hit 20,000 tonnes, more than for the same period of 1996, he said, though he had no comparative figure.
As with most producers, Zhuzhou had been moving its metal to Japan to take advantage of Tokyo's general system of preferences (GSP) policy that exempts developing country imports from tariffs if they are submitted for customs clearance before the beginning of the fiscal year on April 1, the source said.
""This is on long-term contracts, and you can say we're pretty well sold out,"" the source said.
This knowledge has led some Western industry sources to question just how quickly the Chinese could take advantage of the current price rally.
Trading sources said significant tonnages of Chinese zinc had been delivered to warehouses in Singapore, where it is used as collateral for loans but also is available for sales on price rises.
Talk among traders has put the amount stored Singapore at up to 75,000 tonnes, but this could not be confirmed with Chinese or Western sources.
The worldwide Zinc supply is expected to become tight in the second half of 1997. One Western producer representative said his company was sold out for the second half and he saw world prices climbing another $100 a tonne before the end of the year.
""This situation really does seem good for China,"" the Zhuzhou source said.
Zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) ploughed through a 4-1/2-year high on Monday after a sizeable fall in stocks announced last Friday.
The market touched $1,304 a tonne before settling $6 a tonne up on the day at $1,296. The metal at 0200 GMT was being quoted just a shade under $1,300 at $1,294/99 a tonne.
Premiums have begun to soften on the back of the firming prices. One representative of a North American producer said Chinese traders were quoting premiums on a cost and freight (c&amp;f) at $65 a tonne at Chinese ports.
A Chinese trader in Hong Kong, who sells registered and unregistered zinc on behalf of southern Chinese producers, said he was quoting premiums over the LME cash price basis Chinese ports at $70-80 a tonne. He said $60 would be the bottom level.
A Western trader in Singapore said Chinese smelters had sold forward, leaving domestic supply tight. Chinese trading sources agreed that metal in China is now in tight supply.
Firm domestic prices of around 10,500 yuan ($1,265) a tonne were indicative of the tightness, the Zhuzhou source said, ""but the domestic market just isn't that big"".
Some sources in China have said they think 1997 will be a historic year for Chinese zinc exports, with one local trader putting China's total for the year at half a million tonnes, with up to 80,000 tonnes done in January and February alone.
Official China customs figures show China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in January 1997 reached 30,914 tonnes, up 100.3 percent compared to the year-ago period.
China exported 226,777 tonnes of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in 1996, up 18.4 percent on 1995, the figures show.

LynneO'Donnell,"China has missed a golden opportunity to export corn and earn millions of dollars, and now has up to a million tonnes of the grain rotting in silos in the country's north, Far East traders said on Tuesday.
""This year is going to be a major disaster,"" a Hong Kong trader said.
""All that corn sitting in Dalian is just rotting,"" he said, adding his estimate that 500,000 to one million tonnes of corn was stored in northern silos in anticipation of exports.  
Corn, grown predominantly in China's far northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, began moving to northern ports, particularly Dalian, around May, traders said.
""People had geared up for a huge export programme and I think the traditional northeast suppliers anticipated two million tonnes being permissioned for export,"" a trader in Singapore said.
Concern about national food security and the impact on domestic prices that exports would have in an atmosphere of acute inflationary paranoia had kept China out of the world corn market, trading sources said.  
Corn and rice exports were banned in December 1994 after stocks fell to frighteningly low levels in a country where the governing Communist Party bases much of its ruling mandate on availability and affordability of staple foods.
Imports soon began, totalling 5.18 million tonnes in 1995. Corn imports in the first five months of 1996 were 400,000 tonnes, customs figures show.
Expectations began building in April that China's central grain authorities would allow corn exports to take advantage of high world prices and also to ease a local surplus and push up softening domestic prices. Prices had dropped below $120 a tonne in some areas.
Word at the time from traders involved in negotiations with China's central grain reserve on what nature the exports should take -- barter or cash -- was that the corn would be sold mostly to Japan and South Korea at around $180 a tonne.
""There was a stage when they could have got $180, and from the inverse they could have picked up $20 a tonne selling FOB (free on board) and picking up from the U.S. six months later,"" the Singapore trader said. ""They missed a big opportunity.""  
The company was applying for the right to import and export corn ""in order to solve the problem of huge corn stockpiles,"" an official of the company said.
Official figures put 1995 corn production at 101 million tonnes. Output in 1996 has been projected by media to hit 112 million tonnes. Annual demand is 100-115 million tonnes.
Traders and grain industry sources have said China's total corn reserves are up to 30 million tonnes.  
A few hundred thousand tonnes of Chinese corn was sold to Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, or bartered for equipment supplied by Japanese food processing corporations as part of joint-venture deals, industry sources said.
China's government, however, remained adamant that the export ban had not been lifted.
Officials of the newly-established Jilin Grain Group, set up by the Jilin provincial government and opened for business on Monday, told Reuters the province had its biggest stockpile in history, some three million tonnes.  
Traders said that while owners of the corn stocked at northern ports such as Dalian, Yingkou and Qinghuangdao had lost money on transport, storage and deterioration, the grain was now slowly being absorbed back into the domestic market.

LynneO'Donnell,"The manager of China's first joint venture producer of cobalt powder says the market is growing as fast as the economy and he is confident his product will wipe out local competition before the end of the century.
Since it went into production in May 1996, Shanghai Blue Lotus Metals Co Ltd has captured a hefty share of China's market for cobalt powder, Stephan Csoma, the company's general manager, said in a recent interview.
""We have the finest product on the market in China today,"" Csoma told Reuters. He refused to go into details about the financial strength or market share of the joint venture.
Blue Lotus is the first foray into China in a production capacity for Union Miniere SA, a Belgian metals refining and transforming giant and part of the General de Belgique group.
Its subsidiary company, Sogem, already has a significant presence in Asia as a trader of base and minor metals.
Csoma said Union Miniere had invested less than $10 million for a 75 percent stake in Blue Lotus with partner Shanghai Smelter Number Two, also known as the Jiuling Smelter.
Jiuling is one of two major smelters in Shanghai and comes under the auspices of the local branch of the national metals production giant China National Nonferrous Metals Corp (CNNC), he said.
Jiuling has been such a satisfactory partner that Union Miniere is also planning to produce zinc powder with it.
Cobalt is among the hardest metals in the world, and the powder is used in the manufacture of diamond tools that cut everything from concrete to marble and stone, and hard metals that are used to drill the earth for minerals and ore.
The powder is also used in making rechargable batteries for portable phones, computers and the like, Csoma said.
In China, with the world's fastest-growing economy, demand for diamond tools, the biggest market for Blue Lotus, was riding a construction boom, Csoma said.
Accurate figures on China's annual consumption of cobalt powder are difficult to obtain. Csoma said the market was between 400 and 600 tonnes a year.
""Our capacity is a bit above 100 tonnes today so when we get closer to 100 tonnes in terms of sales, we will increase our capacity to 200 tonnes,"" he said.
The eventual goal is capacity of 300 tonnes, Csoma said. Capacity equals the amount of cobalt metal used to make the powder, on a one-to-one conversion ratio, he said.
""I don't see any problem with moving 200 tonnes a year within two or three years; 300 tonnes will take a bit longer and will depend on our international customers moving into China and it will depend on how fast we can keep growing,"" he said.
""Last year was quite fast, we started from nothing and doubled our sales turnover every month until Chinese New Year (in February) when everything closes down,"" he said.
Blue Lotus manages to keep costs for its cobalt powder about the same as Chinese producers for the same grade, Csoma said.
""Today's market price is between 680 yuan and 720 yuan ($82-87) a kg,"" he said.
""It is higher than the international price because we have to pay import tax (six percent) and value-added tax (17 percent) on the metal,"" he said, adding that locally produced cobalt powder is still cheaper than the imported product.
While finding a good partner in China is half the battle won for many would-be China-investors, dealing with the competition is the hard part for Blue Lotus.
Csoma said Blue Lotus had more than 30 competitors in the local market, all with much lower overheads but all producing cobalt powder of lower quality.
""There is an overcapacity (in China)...and I believe we are going to close a lot of them down on quality, price, financial strength.""

LynneO'Donnell,"- The one million tonnes of corn rotting in storage in China's northern port of Dalian will lead to tightened local supplies and force prices up before new crop is available at year-end, traders said on Wednesday.
Up to 50 percent of the stored corn is unfit for milling, a trader in Hong Kong said.
""I'd buy Dalian futures. Prices have got to start going up,"" he said.  
""The price will keep going up until January (because) the new crop won't be available until then, after the farmers have dried it and then want their money for Chinese New Year. If the domestic price keeps going up, what's the point of exporting,"" he said.
Even if exports were an option for China's grain authorities, they no longer make economic sense, traders said.
""What's the point? The inverse has gone. You can't do any better than low $180s (US$ a tonne) into Southeast Asia now. It just doesn't work,"" a U.S. trader in Hong Kong said.  
He said free on board (FOB) values in Dalian were 1,400 yuan ($168) per tonne for good quality corn.
Another regional trader, whose company has joint-venture interests in China's corn belt, said southern feed millers were rejecting the Dalian corn on the basis of quality.
""There is a lot of low quality corn around. We are FOB suppliers so in an atmosphere in which the feed millers are looking for any excuse not to accept cargo, we are having to turn it back,"" he said.  
""In the U.S., they could blend low quality with high quality to get a medium quality product. In China they can't do that because everything is bagged by hand,"" he said.
""So they will just have to sell it at a heavy discount.""
The U.S. trader said China's recent demand for soymeal indicated a need for corn to mix with the protein product.
""Feed values are decent,"" he said. ""Some livestock producers are starting to gear up again and will need corn.""
The Dalian corn could be absorbed into the market over the coming three months, and the poorer quality corn could be used industrially, for instance to produce starch, he said.  
Exports were first mooted in early April, when market prices fell to less than 1,000 yuan ($120) a tonne in some areas of the northeast corn belt comprising Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning.
A few hundred thousand tonnes of Chinese corn did sell to Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, or was bartered for equipment supplied by Japanese food processing corporations as part of joint-venture deals, industry sources said.
China's government, however, remained adamant that its ban on corn exports, imposed in late 1994 when central reserves ran low, had not been lifted.  
Trade and industry sources said they saw official fears of inflation as the reason large-scale exports were not sanctioned. Of the sales that did go ahead, South Korean buyers paid $216.70 a tonne cost and freight (C&amp;F) when U.S. corn was arriving at Asian ports for more than $230 a tonne.
China could easily have sold up to two million tonnes at the time, making substantial hard currency profits and helping increase prices for impoverished farmers, traders said.  
Chinese corn output in 1996 has been projected by the official media to hit 112 million tonnes. Official figures put 1995 corn production at 101 million tonnes. Annual demand is 100-115 million tonnes.
China's corn reserves have been reported at 30 million tonnes. New crop will be harvested from late September to November, and should start arriving at market, in a dried state, a month or so after that.

LynneO'Donnell,"Chinese end-users of copper are buying the metal in small lots but Chinese trading sources said on Tuesday that high world prices would prevent any significant Chinese buying in the short term.
A fall last Friday in copper stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses was not fully attributable to Chinese buying, traders in China and Hong Kong said.
LME copper stocks fell 9,675 tonnes, to 187,777 tonnes last Friday amid reports that most of that material was on its way to China.
""For the time being only one third of the stock moving out of LME warehouses will head to China, because they are taking out their own material,"" a Chinese trader with a provincial-government firm in Hong Kong said.
A trader in Beijing with a major European trading house said China was more likely to sell copper at current prices.
LME three months prices finished the kerb at $2,367 a tonne, down just $1 from Friday's kerb close. The cash/threes backwardation was at $55/60.
""If I bought at $2,310 and I sell at $2,370, I make $60 a tonne,"" the Beijing trader said.
""This does suggest some speculative Chinese action on the LME, but I don't see anything major, long or short, from China,"" he said.
Trading sources said copper prices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) did not indicate any real tightness in domestic Chinese supply.
Figures released by the exchange last Friday showed an increase in copper supplies held on warrant in SME warehouses of 664 tonnes to 13,522 tonnes, which traders here said is about two months' supply.
The exchange is also known to have off-warrant stocks, and China's central reserve has warehouses in the city holding undisclosed tonnages.
Another Chinese trading source in Hong Kong said he was seeing some interest from Chinese end-users who were ordering in small lots of 500 to 2,000 tonnes at a time.
""Some customers in Shanghai are placing small orders and they will take the cargo because they are end-users and they need it,"" he said.
Another source with a Chinese trading firm in Singapore said tight cash flow would also keep smelters off the market until government funds became available later in the first half of 1997.
Trading sources in London and Asia have predicted a further fall in stocks on Tuesday of 25,000 tonnes.

LynneO'Donnell,"China is unlikely to need to buy rice on the international market to make up for flood damage to domestic crops, Far East traders said on Tuesday.
No China inquiries for rice were reported by traders in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.
""As far as large demand from the (central grain) reserve, COFCO (China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp) or the grain bureaux goes, I rule it out,"" said a Chinese trader in Shanghai.  
China's Futures Herald newspaper, quoting State Grain Reserve Administration statistics, said on Saturday that although flood damage had reduced the early rice harvest and was likely to slow planting of late rice, total output for 1996 was expected to be unaffected.
This is because China has increased the area under rice cultivation this year, the newspaper said, adding that the reduction in the early harvest should not have a significant effect on the total grain harvest due to higher production of other crops, it said.  
Rice imports could not go ahead without central government approval, and the process of issuing quotas and licences could take weeks or even months, trading sources said.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said at the weekend that flooding in Hunan, one of China's major rice-growing provinces, had prevented farmers from planting rice for the autumn harvest and could force them to depend on food aid until next summer.  
""Many farmers lost the season's first crop of rice in the floods and were unable to plant for the second harvest, leaving them dependent on food aid until their next crop, in one year's time,"" said Thorir Gudmundsson.
""For the second crop, they need to plant in July, and it is now mid-August,"" he said.
The notion that China might need to import rice to meet demand provided some underlying support to rice futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on Monday.
The CBOT September price closed up 5-1/2 U.S. cents per cwt at $10.16.  
Chicago rice futures have been underpinned by a recent U.S. report that China bought 20,000 tonnes of Vietnamese white rice for prompt July shipments and that additional purchases were expected.
But very little movement in domestic Chinese rice prices has been seen over the past three months, traders said.
""To be convinced that China will buy some rice, I have to get confirmation from the market -- but so far the market has not done anything, prices are steady,"" one Asian trader said.  
Traders in China quoted domestic prices at 2,200-2,300 yuan ($265-$277) a tonne for low quality long grain rice; 2,600-2,700 yuan ($313-$325) for high quality long grain rice; up to 2,800 yuan ($337) for low quality short grain rice; and 3,000 yuan ($361) for high quality short grain rice.
More than 500 people were killed by the July floods in Hunan alone, with the national death toll from floods and typhoons surpassing 2,700, according to the government.
Applications for rice imports would have to traverse China's multi-layered bureaucracy, trading sources said, though the procedure could be speeded up in times of emergency.  
The State Planning Commission (SPC) would issue a national quota, which would then be allocated to provincial SPC offices, which would then distribute the quota to trading companies, trading sources said.
Rice, along with wheat, corn and soybeans, is considered a strategic grain and is thus tightly regulated.
Hunan grows more than 22 percent of China's total early rice crop. Losses to the rice crop in the central province have been estimated at 2.4 million tonnes, accounting for most of the 2.6 million tonnes of Hunan's total grain losses.  
About 90 percent of China's early rice crop of 50 million tonnes is grown in Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. China has three rice crops a year.
A Chinese analyst predicted earlier this month that the flooding could cut early rice output by between 10 and 20 percent. This would reduce the total 1996 rice crop by up to four percent for a total output figure of about 180 million tonnes.
China's rice production in 1995 was 179 million tonnes according to figures from the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp.

LynneO'Donnell,"A plan by U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co to increase its stake in a Chinese truck maker is a bet on the future of China's auto industry, as revitalising the Chinese partner could take years, analysts said on Wednesday.
Ford announced on Wednesday that it planned to increase its investment in Jiangling Motors Corp with the purchase of $54.5 million worth of shares.
""In the longer term it is a beneficial deal, because they (Jiangling) have been losing out in the competition for market share -- and if they don't do something they can't compete at all,"" said An Lu, vice president of China research at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong.
Under the subscription agreement, Ford said it had agreed to increase its equity share in its Chinese partner to about 30 percent from the current 20 percent.
The agreement is subject to approval of Jiangling's shareholders, who will discuss it at a meeting scheduled for April 30, and China's regulatory authorities, Ford said.
Ford and Jiangling are developing a light commercial vehicle that will be launched as a nine- and a 12-seater bus, a Ford spokeswoman told Reuters. A van and a chassis cab, or pick-up truck, would follow, also produced at Jiangling's plant in Nanchang, eastern Jiangxi province, she said.
Jiangling's share of China's top-end light truck market had fallen in recent years to 15-18 percent from about 20 percent as that of its major competitor, Qingling Motors, had risen to about 21 percent, Salomon's Lu said.
He said Qingling's use of Japanese technology through its cooperative deal with Isuzu put it one car generation, or about 10 years, ahead of Jiangling.
Qingling vehicles also commanded a premium of about 10 percent because of their use of the Isuzu name and technology.
Qingling had sold about 35,000 vehicles in 1996, Lu said. Jiangling said in December it expected 1996 sales to reach 17,000 vehicles, compared to 20,500 in 1995.
An injection of Ford capital and technology for Jiangling would be a welcome step towards the future, said analyst John Lu at ING-Barings in Shanghai.
Continued economic growth would spur infrastructure development, he said, and growth of China's interior would spur demand for light trucks for passenger and goods transport.
An analyst with a western bank in Shenzhen, where Jiangling is listed, said the deal would help lower Jiangling's production costs, a substantial overhead in car manufacturing.
Some analyst sources said, however, it could be up to three years before Jiangling was able to effectively utilise the unfamiliar Ford capital and technology.
""I don't know how they will merge their two technologies,"" Salomon's Lu said. ""Or will they choose the new Ford technology and replace the old with the new -- which would mean they have much higher start-up costs.""
""Jiangling will still need at least a couple of years to get production up and running using new technology that is unfamiliar to them, and in redeveloping their market,"" Lu said.
The Shenzhen-based banker said the announcement of the deal should not have any effect on Jiangling's share price,
""There will be some dilution, but the effect would be countered by better company prospects,"" she said.
Trading in Jiangling shares was suspended on Wednesday morning on the announcement. After trading resumed, its B shares edged up slightly to HK$4.00 against HK$3.98 at Tuesday's close.

LynneO'Donnell,"Australia's Prime Minister arrives in China on Friday to redefine Canberra as a friend of Beijing, which less than a year ago accused Australia of being party to U.S. attempts to contain China, business sources said.
John Howard wants to let China know that the business of Australia is business, said Bruce Dover, general manager of PDN-Xinren Information Technology Co, a joint venture of media giant News Corp and Chinese Communist Party newspaper People's Daily providing online computer technology information.
""I think the Chinese have made it clear that if you want to do business, then business becomes the business of government and that should be the priority,"" Dover said.
Sino-Australian relations, warm throughout the 13-year reign of the Australian Labour Party, started to chill once Howard's Liberal Party took over from Labour in elections in March 1996.
The relationship began to sour soon after the elections with the cancellation of a financial support scheme for Australian business in developing countries followed in September by a visit to Australia by Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
The nadir came in August 1996 when China accused Australia of moving too close to the United States, after U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry described Japan and Australia as the northern and southern anchors of Washington's Asian security arrangements.
""From this we can see that the United States is really thinking about using these two 'anchors' as the claws of a crab,"" the official People's Daily said in an editorial.
Australia's trade commissioner in Shanghai, Richard Pillow, said he saw no impact from the political issues on Australia's booming trade with China -- Australian exports to China grew 24 percent in 1996 to A$3.896 billion ($3 billion).
""Howard's visit is a proactive move to strengthen bilateral ties,"" Pillow said, adding that Australian companies were on a long list of international firms wanting a slice of the Chinese pie.
Howard arrives in Shanghai, China's biggest city and its mercantile heart, on Friday evening with a business delegation that includes representatives of Australian banks, insurance firms and commodity trading bodies.
A number of deals expected to be announced during the trip, including the opening in Beijing of a branch of ANZ Bank, business sources said.
In the lead-up to his five-day China trip, Howard emphasised the importance of Canberra's relationship with Beijing and of Australia's place in Asia, and said the level of the business delegation with him reflected this.
""It is probably the most senior and most broadly based representative business group to accompany an Australian prime minister on an overseas trip,"" he said.
In 1996, Australia's imports from China were worth A$4.122 billion, up from A$3.861 billion the year before, Australian officials said.

LynneO'Donnell,"Far East metal traders said on Tuesday they were resigned to seeing China steer clear of major copper purchases before the end of April, when the country's high consumption season begins.
""Now is not the right time of year, I think more towards the later part of this month because that's when the season starts,"" said the head of a trading house in Hong Kong with smelting and refining interests in China.
Small parcel purchases of 500 to 2,000 tonnes at a time by end-users continued, he and other traders said, as they had run down inventory and had no choice but to pay current high prices.
The price of copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) has been hovering around $2,300 a tonne for the past couple of months, as the market waits for China's annual buying programme to begin.
LME copper finished the afternoon kerb last Thursday, ahead of the Easter holiday, at $2,372 a tonne.
China's peak season coincides with the end of winter, as construction projects gear up.
""China is producing healthy amounts of cathode from its own sufficient supplies of concentrate,"" a trader in Beijing said. ""For a short period of time, domestic production should be able to support demand.""
Shanghai Metal Exchange figures show 14,828 tonnes of copper held on warrant in exchange warehouses, which local trading sources have said would be sufficient supply for two months.
Attention has focused on zinc, as Japan's window of tariff-free import opportunity from designated developing countries under its General System of Preferences (GSP) closed on March 31.
Brokerage house Brandeis said last week GSP imports of zinc were expected to reach 90,000-100,000 tonnes, compared to 84,000 tonnes last year. About 70,000 tonnes of that zinc would come from China, Brandeis said, up from 49,000 tonnes last year on expectations of higher world zinc prices spurring higher exports.
Zinc prices on the LME have hovered around 4-1/2-year highs of $1,300 a tonne for the past few weeks, with many trading sources in the region confident of seeing prices touch $1,400 in the foreseeable future.
Zinc closed on the LME on Thursday at $1,295 a tonne.
A trader in Beijing said he expected LME zinc to correct downwards in the short term before bouncing back above $1,300 a tonne.
""After that I think there will be a consolidation and we could see the price move above $1,400 even in the first half of the year,"" he said.
He and other sources in the region said China has begun to move substantial quantities of zinc to LME warehouses in Singapore, with estimates of 20,000-25,000 tonnes on the way.
China's major smelter, Huludao in the northeastern province of Liaoning, was producing 10,000 tonnes of special high grade zinc ingots a month despite annual capacity of 330,000 tonnes, a Chinese industry source said.
Technical problems were keeping production of high quality exportable ingots down, he said.
""The goal is to do as much special high grade as possible but there are problems with the wet electrolytic process that mean they cannot clean the liquid properly and the impurities are higher than they should be for special high grade,"" he said.
Sources at China's other major smelter, Zhuzhou in Hunan province, and at one of its trading representatives in Hong Kong have said it plans to gear up production to take advantage of the high world prices.
Chinese producers are also known to move zinc to Singapore to use as collateral for bank loans. In this case it does not necessarily appear on LME warrants, traders said.

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's upcoming harvest will barely top last year's poor level, but peasants in this vast agricultural country see that they have no choice but to adopt efficient ways, the agriculture minister said on Tuesday.
Viktor Khlystun repeated earlier government statements that Russia would produce at least 70 million net tonnes of grain and that Moscow would not need to import wheat this year.
""Seventy million tonnes is the prediction, and this is realistic,"" Khlystun told a news conference. ""But I hope it will be bigger.""
But as he called for a rejection of Soviet-style cheap state credits and handouts of goods to finance food production, he admitted that 70 percent of Russian farms verged on collapse.
Khlystun, just appointed a deputy prime minister and now the beleaguered farm lobby's top cabinet voice, promised to give his all to implement a government programme aimed at stabilising and modestly reforming the sector.
""It's completely obvious the time has come when we cannot just look calmly at a situation in which many farms are falling apart,"" he said, adding that 10-15 percent of farms were chronically broke, lazy and without any vision of the future.
But he said some key changes in Russia's agriculture sector, still one of the world's most inefficient, were in motion.
""A root change has taken place -- peasants now see that selling output is more important than producing it,"" he said, adding that most farms were now joint stock companies and that 30 percent of them were thriving.
Russian grain output has contracted by around 40 percent from earlier peak levels of 115 million tonnes and more, and imports now supply up to half the food market.
But banks are unwilling to lend to farms, which in turn have no money to invest in output as state credits dry up.
Khlystun, saying farmers wanted to sell grain but did not know how, said Moscow would set up a marketing agency to bring suppliers and sellers together to redress a big problem that has fuelled smaller private imports -- regional supply imbalances.
""There can be no return to credits in kind,"" he added, referring to government handouts of inputs to farmers. ""I really hope 1997 will be the year we succeed in setting up a (private) credit system for the agricultural sector.""
But he did not say how troubled plans to introduce a land market -- crucial if farms are to receive commercial bank credits requiring property or other assets as backing -- could win the consent of conservative parliamentary deputies.
When asked about Russia's grain import needs this year, Khlystun said, ""We will not do centralised (government) imports."" Russia would have enough food wheat but private sector purchases of maize would continue.
Russia's net grain harvest last year was 69.3 million tonnes, the second worst on record in three decades and only a notch below Khlystun's output forecast for this year.
Private commodities houses have been importing some grains as the government loosens its grip on the market and Moscow has sought to procure for the army and far-flung regions on a competitive basis.
But some reform efforts, most notably the Federal Food Corporation state buying agency, have flopped in the face of charges of misuse of funds and inefficiency.

LynnleyBrowning,"Russian demand for imported sugar has picked up earlier than usual on the eve of the beet harvest, and traders said less price volatility and more consolidation were adding stability to the domestic market.
""Demand is normal, prices are stabilising,"" said a senior trade source. ""There's sugar coming into the ports and demand is good.""
He said raws would need to arrive by mid-July to be processed at domestic refineries before the Russian beet crop supplanted them as a feedstock.
""The (Russian) market is strong at the moment,"" said a second senior trade source. ""You are seeing demand for sugar at the moment. There is some pretty intensive importing of raws right now -- the price structures make tolling profitable.""
Traders debated market talk of sugar backlogs at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk and whether Russia could soak up any unplaced cargoes looking for homes.
""If you have raws arriving in the Black Sea in July, you'll be pressed,"" said the first source, adding that refineries needed 14-21 days for processing and that they would be less keen to contract for raws as the beet harvest approached.
Recent market talk that around 250,000 tonnes of raws, possibly Brazilian, could be expected later this summer in Novorossiisk or the Baltics was still speculative, traders said.
A Novorossiisk port source said that a backlog of Cuban raws at the outlet had edged down only slightly to 80,700 tonnes from around 90,000 tonnes last week because the Russian receiver was not ready to take delivery.
He said the port expected to receive around 200,000 tonnes of raws, probably of Cuban origin, this summer, including 70,000 tonnes of unknown origin before June.
Indian refined white sugar stocks in port warehouses were around 400,000 tonnes, the port source said, but the senior trade sources said it was overblown by a factor of ten or more.
Russia is heading into its traditional jam-making season, a major factor that spurs a rise in refined sugar imports.
""People are preempting a little, because demand doesn't normally pick up until end-June,"" said the first trade source, adding, ""the high-quality sugar market is much stronger -- you're seeing significant demand, especially at the Western (beverage) bottlers (with Russia operations).""
Sources said domestic sugar reserves were being drawn down but that a fundamental, long-term pick-up in consumer demand had yet to materialise. Some traders see Russian demand as fairly price inelastic and relatively steady despite economic decline and tight disposable income.
Russian consumption is about five million tonnes a year.
There is less room for European sugar in Russia, which meets most of its needs by importing whites from Ukraine and refining Cuban raws and its own sugar beets.
But the structure of the Russian market is changing.
""The market is consolidating -- it's a natural market development,"" said the first source, adding that the days of suppliers having to leap over three or four middlemen to get to buyers were gone.
""You're getting directly at the refiners, and you're cutting out the wild (price) swings,"" he said.
A big glut in 1995, in which buyers imported too much and demand failed to take off as hoped, forced changes in distribution networks that were now consolidating the market.
""The domestic market will remain strong but it won't go crazy,"" said the first trader. ""But hopefully this will establish a pattern.""

LynnleyBrowning,"Russian Norilsk Nickel's poor 1996 financial results have tarnished plans to issue corporate paper for trading overseas, but the key metal producer has profitable, stable output and may be crying wolf, analysts said on Monday.
""We don't think the (financial) figures will affect output,"" said Dmitry Chernak, metals analyst at ING-Barings in Moscow.
He said Norilsk -- one of the world's top producers of nickel and platinum group metals -- might be fudging the figures to attract government attention to its crippling social costs.
Company officials and analysts said Norilsk's 1996 consolidated loss of 3.29 trillion roubles ($572 million), which RAO Norilsky Nikel reported last Friday, did not mean the Arctic industrial behemoth had no cash to finance output.
""There is and will be absolutely no effect on production or exports,"" said Alexei Parshikov, director of Interrosimpex, which handles some of the Norilsk group's exports.
He said wage arrears to workers were down to less than two months and workers had no inclination to strike as they did earlier this spring before a deal with management was reached.
But Norilsk spokesman Sergei Vetchinin said the company's financial picture was nonetheless unattractive.
""It's a paradox -- the production of metals is profitable, but then the profits get spent on social costs, which in theory the state, not we, should be supporting,"" he said, adding that Norilsk made money on output but subsidiary costs sucked up over 40 percent of annual revenues.
The London Metal Exchange was closed on Monday for a bank holiday and most traders there were not available for comment.
Norilsk is the world's second largest producer of nickel, a key component of stainless steel. It is the world's largest producer of palladium and one of the world's top three producers of platinum -- used in catalytic converters and jewellery.
Chernak said Norilsk had better operating margins than its Western competitors but that rising output costs at the company would take their toll on 1996 margins.
He said Norilsk's 1995 gross operating margin for nickel output was a robust 36 percent, and 34.8 percent for copper, compared with a Western metals industry average of 31.7 percent.
Chernak said higher input costs would reduce Norilsk's margin to 23.0 percent for 1996, but he expected its 1996 net loss to ring in at $120 million equivalent -- far below the figures Norilsk announced.
Norilsk's Vetchinin said the reported 1996 loss figure was calculated on an accruals basis, which meant it was not distorted by figures reflecting non-payment for goods or services, a problem plaguing Russian industrial companies and distorting balance sheets.
But Chernak said Norilsk's loss was misleadingly bloated because it included, among other things, allocations to capital expenditure funds.
A senior Norilsk official told Reuters the 1996 loss meant plans to issue American Depositary Receipts -- paper allowing shares in foreign companies to be traded on world exchanges and avoiding settlement hassles -- were on the backburner.
""That such a possibility (postponing the issue) is being examined is unquestionable,"" said Yuri Kaluzhsky, Norilsk's head for projects and corporate finance, who had told Reuters one month earlier that Norilsk planned to issue the paper by July.
His statement sent Norilsk shares crashing by over 11 percent, and Norilsk ordinaries traded at $6.60 at 1320 GMT on the Russian Trading System. The paper rose 12 percent when the financially troubled company announced the issue.
Norilsk is struggling to enact a restructuring plan in which it hopes the state will assume responsibility for financing its vast social infrastructure, including resettling tens of thousands of pensioners.
Parshikov said efforts to push through restructuring would intensify. But Norilsk officials have been unable to say whether a recent board meeting had approved the plan. ($1 = 5,756 roubles)

LynnleyBrowning,"Russian refineries, pressured by growing domestic demand for transport fuels and cleaner specifications in export markets, are nonetheless a long way from producing lighter products, analysts said.
""You should not expect any significant changes in the composition of the Russian barrel in the next three to five years,"" said Pavis Shahidi, a refining expert at  Bechtel International Inc in London.
""All the upgrading projects are still awaiting financing.""
Russia's 28 major refineries have plans to install conversion systems and some are in talks with international lending institutions on multi-million dollar financing. But none of the major proposals, whose total cost will ring in at around $12 billion, are truly off the ground.
""It requires a lot of money, and investment is hard to get in this country,"" said Peter Lukyanov of Universal Oil Product in Moscow. ""But it is a priority for Russian producers, because it's a big (financial) loss to do heavy fuel oil instead of lighter products.""
Conversion levels at Russian refineries are 50-55 percent, with fuel oil comprising the balance of output, compared to 75-80 percent conversions at leading foreign facilities.
Deeper treatment technologies are in use in only 10 percent of current refining capacity and Russia has not one single hydrocracker, analysts said.
One result is that Russia will continue to produce vast quantities of heavy fuel oil, or mazut, with the sludgy, heavy product now comprising 40 percent or more of oil product output.
Liz Barrett, an energy specialist at CentreInvest Group consultancy in Moscow, said another factor stymieing efforts by refineries to finance conversion technologies was the focus of top managers at the new vertically integrated oil firms on upstream, not downstream, projects.
""Most of the refineries are looking at hydrocrackers (as opposed to less costly but less flexible catalytic crackers) because they want low sulphur diesels,"" she added.
Russia's Soviet-era refineries were designed three and more decades ago to serve a domestic planned economy, and many, especially those clustered in the Volga-Urals region, may not have good export marketing potential.
""The Russian refineries are positioned to supply local markets, and with export and transport costs expensive, it makes it difficult to arrange financing for upgrades,"" Shahidi said.
But under-utilisation -- Russian plants operate at an average 55 percent of their 6.8 million barrels per day capacity -- has meant some refineries run reforming units more severely and in greater volumes, creating more material for desulphuring diesel.
""This is actually how the Russians are making more low-sulphur material,"" Barrett said.
Russia turns out some cracked product but it is not high quality. ""The product is not upgraded -- it's not the result of new conversion processes,"" Lukyanov said, when asked why some Western traders might be seeing more cracked material.
In spite of the lack of changes in refining technologies here, fuel oil output has dropped this year on the back of higher crude oil exports and, some analysts say, scaled-back use at bankrupt domestic military-industrial plants.
Russia produced 21.9 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil in the first four months of the year, down four percent from the same year-ago period, State Statistics Committee figures show.
This represented 38 percent of total refinery throughput of 57.7 million tonnes in the first four months.

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's LUKoil, one of the world's biggest oil companies, will increasingly take its upstream business out of Siberia and into the Caspian and Gulf, in a move reflecting the tough economics of production at home.
LUKoil's strategy underscores the problems of producing oil in Russia, where expensive, hard-to-recover reserves, limp domestic demand and a struggling economy make exports and foreign projects the only ways to earn substantial profits.
""I can tell you we're not really interested in raising our oil output in Russia, and for three reasons -- pipeline capacity limits, small export terminals and low domestic demand,"" LUKoil spokesman Pyotr Neyev said in a brief telephone interview.
LUKoil heads into its shareholders' meeting on Thursday ready to put what Neyev said were net cash profits according to Russian standards of 3.87 trillion roubles ($673 million) to work on projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Iraq.
A second spokesman, Alexander Vasilenko, said LUKoil -- which says it has the most crude oil reserves of any traded oil company in the world -- aimed to produce at least one quarter of its oil outside Russia at the beginning of the next millenium.
""LUKoil does admit they're not investing much in their West Siberia operations,"" said Renaissance brokerage energy analyst Alexei Kokin. ""They have too many undiversified costs there, and they're relocating fronts.""
Among LUKoil's major non-Russia projects are a 52.5 percent stake in a $4 billion, 23-year production-sharing project in Iraq's Western Qurnah; a 12.5 percent stake in an $8 billion international Azeri Caspian project that is the largest foreign investment deal in the former Soviet Union; and significant stakes in two other Azeri projects.
It is set to receive a five percent stake in Chevron Corp's and Mobil Corp's Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, and has a $5.2 billion, 18-year joint venture agreement with Atlantic Richfield (ARCO), which owns eight percent of Russia's largest vertically-integrated oil firm.
It is also eyeing Algeria, and has a deal with Italy's Agip Spa to look at North African projects.
""I think the strategy is a correct one -- but it's not an easy one to copy,"" said a Western energy consultant, adding that LUKoil President Vagit Alekperov, half-Azeri and born in Baku, had connections to Caspian oil that other oil bosses did not.
Russian oil producers make no money on domestic production not exported and by some estimates earn 80-90 percent of their profits from sales abroad and the remainder from regional sales of refined oil products.
Output and transport costs for Western Siberia, where three-quarters of LUKoil's 10.7 billion barrels in proven reserves are located, are about $6 per barrel, Kokin said, compared to estimates of $2 per barrel in the Caspian.
""Generally, the domestic Russian oil business is loss-making,"" said the Western analyst. ""You get some earnings in regional distribution (of refined products like gasoline). But selling crude to Russian refineries or on the Russian spot market is loss-making.""
Despite an aggressive expansion programme, LUKoil, which accounted for nearly 20 percent of Russian oil production last year with output of 1.16 million barrels per day, sees home production rising by 2.4 percent this year.
Most Russian oil companies face similar problems, and are struggling to turn the tide against output declines while calculating the value of increased output against export pipelines already filled to the limit.
But LUKoil, a favourite among foreign portfolio investors, in part due to its success in consolidating control over its production units, refiners and distributers, is the exception, not the rule, among Russia's newly-privatised oil companies.
""LUKoil's move abroad is correct,"" said the Western analyst. ""But its Russian competitors will not be able to do the same.""

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's hot new reformer, Boris Nemtsov, is sparking changes at the Fuel and Energy Ministry he now heads, revamping the grey body in ways which could reshape output and exports by the world's third largest oil producer.
Industry sources say Nemtsov, who is trimming the ministry's bloated staff and reorganising the Soviet-era institution to deal with new market realities, is moving to make Russian oil exports to Western markets more transparent.
But Nemtsov also wants to keep Russia well supplied with oil products and prevent regional deficits which have arisen over the past year as producers boost exports at the expense of supplying domestic refineries.
The streamlining envisaged by Russia's golden boy of reform includes fairer access to stretched-to-capacity export pipelines -- first-quarter oil exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States were up 7.2 percent from year-ago levels at 2.0 million barrels per day.
""The big question is 'Who will control access to export pipelines?'"" asked a senior Western oil industry source in Moscow. ""Moving administration of the pipeline system to a regulatory body is not a bad thing.""
But Nemtsov, who is also a first deputy prime minister in charge of restructuring natural monopolies, including the Transneft oil pipeline outfit, is mindful of domestic needs.
His hand-picked protege, Sergei Kiriyenko, a young banker brought on board as first deputy fuel and energy minister, said the ministry had a duty to keep everyone from domestic power plants to farmers adequately supplied with oil products.
""You can influence the producers only by creating specific stimuli, not by government telegrams,"" Kiriyenko told Wednesday's edition of the Kommersant business daily.
""Of course, there are coercive methods, like access to export pipelines. If we see Russia does not have enough oil products, then the volume of exported oil will be limited.""
Kiriyenko said the ministry's priority was to bring balance into the domestic fuel and energy market and create desirable conditions for companies at home.
Nemtsov, 38, was appointed Fuel and Energy Minister in April, taking responsibility for one of Russia's most strategic and highest-earning sectors under sweeping changes which put reformers in charge of the government.
In a big overhaul, he divided the Fuel and Energy Ministry into two sections -- one in charge of operations, headed by Kiriyenko, and one dealing with investment, headed by Viktor Ott, a ministry old-timer liked by Western energy executives.
Ott will deal with development licences and a supervisory body handling domestic fuel supply issues.
Kommersant quoted Kiriyenko as saying the new team would change ""the obsolete position of the ministry"".
The ministry's old way of functioning includes forcing oil producers to supply regions with oil products essentially for free and deciding how much oil companies can export.
""I can't say we've yet felt the effect of his changes, but it's fairly clear that when the process is over, the ministry will be vastly different than what it was before,"" said the Western executive.
Kiriyenko said the ministry was in no position to lead Russia's newly privatised oil companies but should play a role in managing state shares in the new majors.
Nemtsov, who met Western oil executives at the influential Moscow International Petroleum Club on Tuesday, was quoted by Kommersant as saying no single Russian oil producer would be allowed to account for more than 25 percent of total oil output.
Western executives at the meeting said Nemtsov would fire half of the ministry's 800 or so bureaucrats, stripping away legions who delayed everything from talks for joint ventures to approval for exploration licences.
""We're going to create more attractive conditions for you,"" Kommersant quoted Nemtsov as telling the executives.
"
LynnleyBrowning,"Russian oil refiners are eyeing costly upgrades to make the lighter products that export markets favour, but they may find it hard to find the cash.
Hydrocrackers and fluid catalytic crackers -- expensive, sophisticated plants that produce lighter material like gasoline, naphtha, diesel and jet fuel -- are rare in Russia, where heavy fuel oil makes up around 40 percent of output.
Most Russian refiners use less sophisticated processing technologies, and only three percent of capacity comes from cracking processes, well below Western levels.
""There's just a screaming need for secondary capacity,"" said a senior Western energy consultant in Moscow. ""But who's willing to invest in a Russian refinery?""
Boston Consulting Group says that by 2000, new capacities in Russia could include 254,000 barrels per day (bpd) of catalytic cracking and 131,000 bpd of hydrocracking, both used to produce expensive, high-octane fuels.
The increases, and boosts to other processes, could bring Russia's products output to 5.9 million bpd by 2000 from a current 5.2 million -- but the analysts said they would not mean heavy product output falls by the wayside.
""You will clearly increase light products capacity, but you also at least maintain the heavy products,"" said Boston Consulting Group Vice-President Charbel Ackermann. ""It's not a substitution or reduction for heavy capacity.""
Oil sources said Russia's 28 major refineries had collectively put in 28 formal requests to international lenders and banks for loans for upgrades -- but money has not flowed in.
""Lots are talking about it, but few are actually doing it,"" said Bechtel International Inc. Vice-President Robert Parker.
In one of many plans dependent on full financing, Russia's Kirishi refinery has said it hopes Chevron will help install a $750 million hydrocracker.
The Yaroslavl refinery, north of Moscow, is getting a $60 million catalytic cracking unit to boost gasoline output, while the Angarsk refinery in Siberia is working with M. W. Kellogg on a $70 million plan for a fluid catalytic cracking unit.
The Fuel and Energy Ministry said the Omsk refinery, in Siberia, would get a catalytic reforming plant by 2000, and that ABB Lummus Global was working on plans to help the Perm, Samara, Angarsk and other refineries install catalytic crackers.
Rif Usmanov, chief engineer at the Ufa refinery in southern Russia, said the plant's catalytic cracking facility, completed in March, would produce two million tonnes of gasoline and diesel a year (about 40,000 bpd).
An engineer at the Ryazan refinery south of Moscow said revamping of a catalytic cracking unit to raise capacity to 24,000 bpd would continue into 1997.
""A lot of projects are merely adjusting the heights of the columns and tinkering with other things,"" said energy specialist Peter Houlder at CentreInvest consultancy in Moscow. ""But most of these are not $200-$300 million projects.""
Some question the timing of the proposed upgrades, saying transport costs to Europe will squeeze margins too much.
""A lot of ambition is geared on the basis of exporting product to Europe, which I don't think is that logical,"" Parker said. ""Continental Europe is surrounded by state-of-the-art, high-tech refineries and sophisticated distribution.""
But the economy in Russia's Volga and Urals regions, where heavy industry is in steep decline, is not picking up quickly and may not be able to absorb new products output soon.
""With the domestic market's limited absorption capacity, you'll still see an inclination to export heavy,"" Ackermann said.

LynnleyBrowning,"Russian economic crime officials said on Thursday they were investigating the head of Russia's second largest aluminium smelter.
Company and ministry officials said Yuri Kolpakov, general director of Krasnoyarsk, the second biggest aluminium smelter in the world, was under investigation over the alleged failure to repatriate $20 million from contracts for raw materials supplies.
Olga Semenyaka, a member of an Interior Ministry investigative committee dedicated to the crackdown on crime in industry, told Reuters by telephone from the south Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk that she had personally opened the investigation on Monday.
""I think I have told you enough,"" Semenyaka said. She declined to give further details.
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov is locked in a battle against what he has described as the ""crime-ridden"" world of Russia's aluminium industry, which last year was the world's biggest exporter of primary metal.
Gennady Druzhinin, Krasnoyarsk's board chairman, confirmed by telephone from Krasnoyarsk that a probe had been launched against Kolpakov, but also gave no details.
Asked if output or exports would be affected, he said, ""No.""
Krasnoyarsk produced 770,000 tonnes of aluminium last year, 27 percent of Russia's 2.87 million tonne output.
Andrei Grigoryev, head of the smelter's information section, said he did not know of the charges and said Kolpakov was out of town. Reuters could not contact him.
Interior Ministry officials in Moscow could not be reached for immediate comment.
Kulikov has never said what kind of crimes he believes take place in the domestic metal industry, but Russian aluminium officials have in the past been the target of death threats and contract killings.
Industry sources said the investigation of Kolpakov concerned a tolling deal -- under which a trading company supplies a smelter with raw materials for processing and then exports the finished metal -- with an offshore concern identified by the sources as Leo Trust Company.
Krasnoyarsk, also known as KrAZ, does much of its tolling business with Glencore AG of Switzerland, which has a stake in the smelter and a joint venture called Krazpa Metals NV. There is no suggestion Glencore is linked in any way to the investigation.
""If it weren't for Glencore, we wouldn't be working right now,"" said a Krasnoyarsk source. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia will be a big buyer of Iraqi oil once again as Baghdad gears up to export more crude to raise much-needed cash for food and medicine, Russian officials said on Thursday.
""We're aiming for as much this time as we had last time,"" said Yuri Agababov, deputy general director of Zarubezhneft, the Moscow-based firm coordinating Russian contracts for Iraqi oil under the United Nation's oil-for-food deal.
The United Nations renewed a $2 billion, 180-day programme on Wednesday under which Iraq will export oil to raise cash for humanitarian needs and to pay reparations to Gulf War victims after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Russian companies bought nearly 28.54 billion barrels of Iraqi oil under the first 180-day programme, or a whopping 23.4 percent of the 121.6 million or so barrels Baghdad was permitted to export under that first deal.
""We're hoping to do this much again,"" Agababov said in a brief telephone interview. ""But it will all depend on how the commercial terms of our talks proceed. Let's not jinx it by talking about it before it happens.""
The U.N. resolution renews the programme from June 8, right after the first deal expires, and Agababov said he would head a delegation of Russian companies to Baghdad next week to begin negotiating contracts with Iraqi state oil firm SOMO.
He said talks had not yet taken place and declined to say whether contracts had been pre-negotiated in principle.
""Those firms which participated will do so again, and there may be some new players,"" Agababov said, adding that Russian companies lifted their last loading of crude on May 22-25.
Russia has an inside track to Iraq, its Soviet-era trading partner and geopolitical ally, and is keen to see Baghdad flush with cash to repay the $7 billion it owes Moscow.
Russia's -- and one of the world's -- largest oil companies, LUKoil, has a 52.5 percent stake in a $4 billion, 23-year production-sharing project in Iraq's Western Qurnah oil field.
Other Russian firms, including Mashinoimport, have supplied Baghdad with oil equipment, and organisations close to the Foreign Trade Ministry sent wheat, sugar, vegetable oils and other foodstuffs.
But Agababov said commerce, not politics, was at work in the oil-for-food deal. ""We'll participate on the same level and terms as others,"" he said. ""It all comes down to the terms of the contracts.""
He declined to say how the terms had been attractive to the eight Russian oil-producing and trading companies which had contracts under the first deal.
Benchmark Brent Blend's nearby contract, a benchmark for valueing Iraq's exports and thus their quantity, was around $18.74 a barrel in early London futures trade.
That was more than $5.00 below the December 10, 1996 nearby-contract level when Iraq first returned to world oil markets under the first U.N. programme.
But Russian traders, who are finding it tougher to win access to tight domestic export pipelines, are keen to get their hands on any oil they can.
Vladimir Bjedougov, deputy head of major trader Alfa-Eko's international section, which had a big contract under the first programme, said lifters had taken a hit from what he called the failure of the U.N.-Iraqi price formula to reflect the market.
""Prices fluctuated fairly sharply for a while and the formula didn't reflect the difference -- but I wouldn't say this experience would have any effect on our next talks,"" he said.
""On the contrary, it will make things easier. The first contract went well, even though in any deal, there are always technical problems -- but none of them were critical.""

LynnleyBrowning,"The former Soviet Union will probably see grain output increase this year after last year's drought-hit disaster, industry officials said on Friday.
But unpredictable weather in Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, the region's biggest grain producers, could still hit volume and quality levels.
""Ukraine was very bad last year, Russia was quite low and Kazakhstan was below average,"" said Andrei Sizov of SovEcon Ltd, a private agricultural consultancy in Moscow, referring to 1996 output levels that were among the worst in three decades.
""This year, weather conditions have so far been better for all three. But 'better' is in comparison to what was last year's really bad situation.""
Kazakhstan and Ukraine export much of their surplus grain to Russia and other former Soviet republics, as well as to Eastern and Central Europe. Kazakhstan accounted for up to three quarters of Russia's wheat and wheat flour imports last year.
Sowing in the three countries is nearly complete, and industry sources said the weather, not low agricultural inputs, was the main factor -- and the main unknown.
""I think we can definitely say output in all three countries will improve on last year, but it's all still unpredictable because the weather is unpredictable,"" said Vladimir Totsky, deputy director of Russia's Grain Union, a private grouping of traders and producers.
Russia may finally reverse a five-year trend of declining grain area, with around 30 million hectares sown, not including maize, on public-sector farms.
""This is more than enough for Russia to meet its needs,"" Sizov said, forecasting net wheat output of 35-38 million tonnes compared with last year's 35 million. ""Imports will fall and there may be material for export.""
Officials have forecast net grain output of at least 70 million tonnes after last year's 69.3 million, which was the second worst crop in three decades.
Average temperatures in the European part of Russia were five to six degrees Celsius lower than normal at the end of May, Viktor Trenin of the State Meteorological Service said, adding the cold had not seriously hurt crops.
But Siberia and the Urals had the most unusual weather in a century, he said, adding that very hot, dry temperatures in recent weeks made crops grow too fast and sucked moisture away.
An expected cold snap with possible frosts could further hurt plantings, he said, adding, ""We haven't seen fluctuations like this in 100 years. It's dangerous."" He said it was too early to predict weather patterns in the coming months.
An Agriculture Ministry official said Russian winter grains were in good condition, with winterkill losses the lowest in five years at five percent, compared with last year's eight to 11 percent.
In Ukraine, crops were planted two weeks late and experienced a cooler, wet spring. Totsky said yields were below 1996 levels.
Ukrainian officials have declined to forecast summer weather conditions, but Sizov said net grain output in the former breadbasket would rise to 31-33 million tonnes from last year's paltry 25.4 million. The government has forecast 35 million tonnes.
In Kazakhstan, the most secretive of the big former Soviet producers, officials have declined to forecast publicly how output might improve on last year's official, drought-hit 11.6 million tonnes. Almaty's Agro-Industrial Exchange sees output at a net 14 million tonnes.
""They had some problems with their sowing campaign,"" said Totsky, referring to official figures showing the area sown to grain down to 14.5 million hectares from 1996's 16.1 million.
The giant Central Asian state saw an early spring with heavy rains. Sizov said the weather was a big factor in northern Kazakhstan, where drought often mixes with downpours and snows during the autumn harvest.
""Every year, we have to wait and see what cards the weather deals us,"" said Totsky. ""This year will be better, but there's still an element of unpredictability.""

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's energy sector will soon have fewer domestic players as newly-privatised oil companies eye domestic mergers and acquisitions to improve production and refining margins, industry sources said on Monday.
Producers -- eager to cash in on higher refined oil products prices abroad and at home and to replenish books with cash for big-ticket production projects -- were beginning to eye downstream and upstream consolidation, analysts said.
While it was early for formal mergers, they said Russian companies were beginning to lay the groundwork for acquisitions and a shakeout of the sector's dozen or so vertically-integrated companies and eight independent firms was inevitable after 1998.
""Undoubtedly we will see a winnowing,"" said Stephen O'Sullivan, director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London.
""There are too many oil companies and not all can survive.""
Moscow has transformed its old Soviet production associations into vertically-integrated companies, but the process left most firms with major imbalances between production and refining.
Russia is awash in refining overcapacity, which, at 6.8 million barrels per day, far outstrips current output of around 5.8 million bpd -- making refineries prime takeover candidates.
""Yes, I see consolidation,"" said Dan Lubash, managing director of Emerging Markets Europe at Merrill Lynch in London. ""Margins in a market in transition tend to move very quickly.""
In one example of the slimming awaiting the world's third largest oil producer, Russia's LUKoil -- one of the world's largest oil companies by reserves -- said on Monday it would seek to acquire Norsi-Oil, an independent refiner with marketing units and no production facilities.
""This is not a hostile takeover, but rather two companies working together,"" said LUKoil spokesman Pyotr Neyev, adding LUKoil would seek a major equity stake in the plant.
Analysts said producers were increasingly annoyed at seeing lower profits from refineries where they conducted tolling operations -- supplying crude oil for processing at plants they do not own and then taking it back for resale.
In a second takeover battle, an industry source said oil major SIDANCO and mini-major Sibneft were tussling for Rosneft, the state oil holding firm which holds the government's stake in production-sharing deals and is slated for privatisation.
Analysts said a third shakeout could see Sibneft making a play for the East Siberian Oil and Gas exploration company.
""Downstream in Russia, something has to happen,"" said a senior Western consultant. ""The money's not coming back to the producers, and something has to be consolidated.""
But upstream consolidation is also inevitable, since the future of Russian oil is in hard-to-recover, remote, expensive reserves requiring a pooling of cash and technical expertise.
""If you're aiming at economies of scale in five years, you've got to start the (consolidation) process now, and that's what we're seeing"" said the Western consultant.
One such deal tried and failed last year, when former Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik tried to create a giant oil corporation by merging four companies -- the Tyumen Oil Company, ONAKO, the Eastern Oil Company and Slavneft.
""The general feeling is that only those strong enough in terms of corporate structures and centralised cash flows will be looking to pick up assets in the upstream business,"" said a Russian energy analyst at a Western investment bank in Moscow.
But analysts said mergers were already on many companies' agendas.
""There are two driving forces here,"" said O'Sullivan. ""A desire to move into downstream, and a drive by existing companies to consolidate their existing holdings fast.""

LynnleyBrowning,"Western oil joint ventures in Russia, their hands tied by myriad taxes and the unknown policies of a new energy minister, are finding it tougher than ever to make money, industry sources said on Friday.
""Nothing's really happening on the jv side because they (the Russians) don't have a good investment vehicle,"" said an independent U.S. energy consultant in Moscow. ""And I don't see anything that would suggest a quick turnaround.""
Zarko Stefanovski, an oil analyst at T. Hoare &amp; Co brokerage in London, estimated net revenue on each barrel of oil produced and exported from Russia by joint ventures at about $4.40.
That is after current per-barrel costs of about $2.70 for operations, $2.75 for transport, $2.00 in excise duty on output, $0.65 in pipeline tax, mineral royalties of $1.30 and road and housing taxes of $0.35.
Then comes Russia's 35 percent profits tax, which is revenue, not profit, based.
""The biggest nightmare is having to adjust the budgets meeting after meeting after meeting,"" said a Western oil man, complaining that Russia's taxes changed constantly. ""Morale in the company then falls because we don't get the money to do what we need because the economics are skewed.""
About 40 Western ventures produce and export Russian oil -- but their output, at about 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), is a drop in the bucket of Russia's total 6.2 million bpd.
""The export tax is gone, but these other taxes have more than made up for it,"" added a Western energy consultant in Moscow who works with major U.S. oil companies. ""You can't say across the board everyone's making a profit.""
Joint ventures were thought to be a cheaper, easier and faster way than more complex production-sharing contracts to access Russia, the world's third-largest oil producer, which could hold five percent of the world's proven reserves.
""They have a potential to be a success long-term,"" said Brian Leonard, first deputy director of KomiArcticOil, which groups British Gas Plc with Russia's Komineft and a local geological outfit.
But Zarko said joint ventures would take off only when their bigger cousins, multi-billion dollar production-sharing contracts undertaken by Western majors, get to the output phase -- at least several years down the line.
In the absence of an acceptable legal framework, many ventures plead for Kremlin favours to secure special deals.
Western oil men bow and scrape before ministries and the cabinet on two fronts, the Petroleum Advisory Forum and the Moscow International Petroleum Club, which includes Russian industry executives.
The policies of new Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov remain unclear to oil men and tax changes from other officials have not been forthcoming.
A new threat comes from Russia's State Customs Committee, which says prominent ventures should pay millions of dollars for ""excess"" exports -- including White Nights, a 50-50 venture between Phibro Energy Production Inc and Russian Sidanko's Varyoganneftegaz, and KomiArcticOil.
""We think it's absolute nonsense and are hoping for a resolution to the situation,"" a senior oil executive said.
In the meantime, corporate budgets are constantly revised and oil men are discouraged.
""The environment is certainly very tough and it hasn't gotten any easier,"" said one of the Western consultants.
""A lot are hanging on, hoping to get a stake in the market to get better terms when things change.""

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's powerful Gazprom pushed back a plan on Wednesday to issue more share look-alikes for foreigners, saying it needed time to clear out its massive debts to give its stock time to appreciate.
But the company also issued a challenge to the government to meet it half way as it struggles to make tax and other payments which are crucial to the functioning of Russia's economy.
Eduard Ivanov, director of securities at the world's largest natural gas producer, told a news conference RAO Gazprom planned to issue a second tranche of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) next year, not this year as previously planned.
""We consider it expedient to place this tranche in 1998... However the exact timing has not yet been set,"" he said.
He said Gazprom still planned to start issuing convertible bonds this year and that the ADSs would be sold on U.S. markets.
But company officials said one reason for the ADS delay was Gazprom's tortuous efforts to find a common language with the government -- once its unquestioning supporter -- on payments by the giant company into the budget and state funds.
Much is at stake. Gazprom accounted for 26 percent of Russia's 1996 tax revenue -- a whopping figure which underscores the wealth of the company and its key role in Moscow's efforts to plug the budget deficit and keep market reforms on track.
Gazprom, with a market capitalisation of $16.5 billion, accounts for over one-third of global gas reserves, 95 percent of Russian gas output and 39 percent of the world's gas trade.
""We are taking the responsibility to pay our debts,"" Pyotr Rodionov, deputy chairman of Gazprom's board and a former energy minister, said. ""But we also demand the government take steps to meet us halfway, especially in planning the 1998 budget.""
""It's time for the state to conduct itself correctly with regard to payments from energy companies,"" he said, referring to what he thought were unrealistic state revenue targets.
Gazprom has been the target of attacks by the cabinet's fresh-faced reformers, who have promised the giant will not be broken up but want it to pay its corporate and other debts.
Gazprom argues that its consumers -- mostly gas-fired power plants and industrial enterprises -- are late payers fuelling a payments crisis whose blame is laid at Gazprom's door.
The company -- once a ministry, once headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and now quite coveted by foreign investors -- took pains last month to say peace had broken out in talks with the cabinet on its arrears.
Gazprom said it still owed 3.5 trillion roubles ($608 million), down from an estimated 14.8 trillion ($2.6 billion).
But Rodionov said the two sides needed common understanding.
""We must first sort out our relations to the state,"" he said, describing what needed to happen before Gazprom offered more of its equity to foreign investors. ""That is the element which will facilitate growth in our share price.""
In a sign the government is still sympathetic to Gazprom's problems, a senior official said on Tuesday one option would be to transfer assets of indebted power companies to Gazprom. Gazprom's first tranche of ADSs, issued in October 1996 and listed in London, set foreign investors drooling. The company plans to make nine percent of its capital available to foreign investors -- who currently own less than two percent.
It accounts for 60 percent of Europe's gas imports but plans to sell even more by raising capital abroad for its $45 billion Yamal project linking Arctic gas fields to Western consumers.
Some of the money will come from the ADSs; other from a bridging loan of $1.2 billion and medium term credits of up to $3 billion dollars, for which Gazprom has mandated banks Credit Lyonnais and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
A Gazprom official who declined to be identified said ABN-Amro and Goldman Sachs -- which were awarded but lost the mandates -- would probably still arrange Gazprom's planned Eurobond.
""Every bank wants to work with us,"" Rodionov said. ""Of course it's a competitive battle.""
Gazprom has a strictly-divided share structure separating paper available on the Russian market from that on foreign markets, where ADSs effectively cost three times as much as Russian paper. But Rodionov said this could be tough.
""A lock on a door won't stop a cheater,"" he said.  REUTER

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's Norilsk Nickel mining and smelting company said on Thursday a cash crisis could tarnish its plans to become the world's top nickel producer in 1997.
The company had to cut costs, and to do that successfully it needed the government's cooperation.
Norilsk, previewing of one of the puniest payouts yet seen in Russia's emerging market, also said its board would recommend at an annual shareholders meeting on Friday a 1996 privileged share dividend of just two roubles -- an infinitesimal sum in dollar terms and way below 1995's 438 roubles.
Norilsk is a leading global producer of nickel and metals such as platinum and palladium. It aims to boost nickel output by 20 percent this year to 213,000 tonnes, taking advantage of idled capacity to become the world number one.
But Norilsk spokesman Sergei Vetchinin said the firm could be frustrated by cash problems that are reflected in a dividend structure which recommends no payout on ordinary shares for the second year running.
""Realisation of the 1997 production plan strongly depends on the decisions of the government with regard to our needs to cut costs,"" he said.
Norilsk's production north of the Arctic Circle is profitable but vast expenses are pushing it into the red.
""We have a plan,"" Vetchinin said. ""We're not just crying...We are working to improve things.""
But he added, ""If our costs do not come down, and that will take place by the state taking responsibility for our social costs, things may change.""
The state holds 51 percent of voting shares in Norilsk, a stake entrusted temporarily to commercial bank Uneximbank, which is trying to revamp everything from Norilsk units' finances and export revenue flows to the cost of supporting pensioners.
Vetchinin said the board would vote on items that could affect the company's charter and Uneximbank would vote according to State Property Fund instructions, but he gave no details.
At the end of 1996, RAO Norilsky Nikel was owed 6.9 trillion roubles ($1.2 billion). It owed, through tax and other arrears, 16.9 trillion roubles, Vetchinin said.
This has helped make its flagship mining and metallurgical complex one of Russia's top debtors and a source of labour unrest that has in the past sent world metals markets gyrating.
But a company statement said workers were satisfied management was making progress in paying off wage and other arrears, which had been halved to six weeks, and that under a deal ending July 1, output would not be disrupted.
""The downhill slide has been halted and the proof is thus -- we have a team of managers, a programme and real resources for production,"" Vetchinin said, adding the government could sign a decree restructuring the company's debt as soon as next week.
Norilsk, which has said it could be near bankruptcy after 1996 consolidated losses of 3.29 trillion roubles according to Russian accounting standards, likes to describe its problems as social and political, not economic and financial.
But some of its problems stem from market, not state, relations. Vetchinin said Norilsk wanted its natural gas supplier to cut its rates, not supplies, as it has since early June, forcing Norilsk to run partly on heavy fuel oil.
Russia also accounts for about 60 percent of the world's palladium supply and around 20 percent of platinum deliveries, with Norilsk accounting for most of Russian production.
""If you look at our production as separate from our other costs, it's profitable,"" Vetchinin said. The main complex's profit margins on nickel, used to manufacture stainless steel, were 18 percent, he added.
""But we want to tell our own state that if we don't get rid of our expenses, then our metal will cease to be competitive on world markets after 2000."" ($1 = 5,760 roubles)
"
LynnleyBrowning,"No roads link Russia's Arctic city of Norilsk to the rest of the world. A flight across the Siberian tundra or a trip across the frozen Kara Sea are the only ways to reach this gigantic mining and smelting centre.
A lone highway from Norilsk airport to the company town winds across blinding, snow-blanketed tundra, across which locals say lurk an array of nuclear missiles primed to strike.
After an hour's bumpy ride, the Arctic sun struggles behind a pall of filth and Norilsk, one of the world's biggest metals combines and a monument to Soviet industrial might, rises menacingly from a gruesome, gritty blanket of smelter fumes.
The dark air here is so polluted that for the average local resident, life ends at 50.
Apartment hallways can be covered in blue ice when temperatures drop below minus 50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit) in winter.
""Norilsk was built for working, not living,"" said Andrei Samokhin, spokesman for Norilsk Nickel, the company that effectively is the town. ""There's nothing to do but work.""
DEADLY PAST, POISONED FUTURE, LITTLE GOLD FOR WORKERS
Norilsk pulses with the ghosts of at least 100,000 political prisoners whom Soviet dictator Josef Stalin exiled to this forsaken spot in the 1930s and 40s to work one of the planet's richest, but most desolate, sites for turning mineral deposits of nickel, platinum, gold and other ores into pure metals.
For Mitrofan Rubeko, a rare 85-year-old survivor of Stalin's purges, Norilsk, 200 miles (320 km) north of the Arctic Circle, is an outpost of outrage. ""None of the young want to remember the history of Norilsk,"" he said in his spartan apartment.
Norilsk has no monument to the innocent victims of forced labour, no mention of them in the town museum and no talk of one of the most prominent episodes in the Soviet Union's climb to a communist industrial heaven. Not one book has been published in Russia on the town's real history. Company officials have ignored Rubeko's request to erect a monument.
Norilsk does have a monument to the town's first ""engineers"". Most were officers in the secret police that later became the KGB. They supervised thinly clad prisoners labouring in the open air and sleeping in wooden barracks with ice floors.
Norilsk now has three nickel and copper smelters, two of them skeletal dinosaurs belching poisonous gases. It has metals processing and enriching plants and some of the world's richest mines of nickel, platinum, palladium, cobalt, copper and gold.
The new generations of Norilsk's 300,000 residents -- some descendents of Stalin's victims, others children of later, hardy souls who headed north decades ago for higher wages -- are miners and metalworkers who look a decade older than they are.
""It's so ecologically dangerous in Norilsk, you aren't even supposed to give birth here,"" said Sergei Yurshov, director of the main nickel plant's electrolysing unit.
Norilsk says it is in the throes of financial crisis -- but its streets are literally paved with gold.
Tonnes of filthy cancer-inducing black slag, sparkling with precious metals, are collected from the smelters and sifted over streets to keep them from freezing.
""The state sees the bullion, but this is all we see,"" said Boris Degtyarov, an official at the main trade union.
There is more beautiful poison at the electrolysing plant, where luminous, lime-green liquid nickel, laced with electricity, is processed from matt black slabs glinting with the earth's most prized metals.
The dark cobbled floors and 1940s technology, exposing steel entrails and frames of processing lines, have a mediaeval air.
Concentrations of carcinogenic nickel in the air are 200 times Western norms and 20,000 times the worthy but never attained Soviet standard.
In Norilsk, women retire at 40, men at 45. Degtyarov says 90 percent of newborn babies have serious illnesses or handicaps. An aura of illness pervades everything here. One mine, Keyerkan, means Valley of Death in the language of the local Dolgan people.
Despite the richness of its ore mines, Norilsk has not created wealth for its workers.
Difficulties in keeping tabs on just who exports its multi-billion dollar output, and vast tax arrears have not helped the labour force, whose wages are two months behind.
""Where's the money for the metals going?"" asked Rubeko, shaking his silver-haired head. ""That I cannot understand.""
A FROZEN, UNDERGROUND HELL
Deep in the Taimyr mine, 1.5 km (one mile) below the permafrost, is a darker world, where miners labour round the clock in shifts and cavernous tunnels worm through the earth.
Get lost and you are in severe danger -- engineers daily blast out new galleries with dynamite. The rule for finding the way out -- hold up a wet finger and sense the faint breeze from the ventilation shaft.
The lift, a 15 minute or so ride, rumbles like a distant rocket's afterburners.
""The lift cables are rusted,"" said duty operator, Sergei. ""But we love our jobs,"" he added, inciting laughter from miners waiting to be ferried down into the bowels of the Arctic.
The Soviet authorities saw Norilsk as the embodiment of the socialist city-factory and as an organising principle for society. Now the remains of that vision are being tested by new market forces. Already hundreds of homeless live in the town's boiler plants.
Company officials speak of uprooting pensioners to warmer climes, where they would cost less to support, and of the need to trim a bloated workforce.
The plans have made Norilsk a barometer of the troubles faced by Russian industries in casting off their Soviet legacy. But they are hotly contested.
""You'd need two Kalashnikovs for every policeman if you had a load of unemployed wandering these streets,"" Degtyarov said.
Rubeko, dragged to Norilsk in 1938 after a midnight knock at his door in southern Russia, despairs at the thought of a second exile. ""You can't resettle an 85-year-old man,"" he said.
After working at Norilsk for 66 years, Rubeko, now head of the local chapter of the Society for the Defence of the Victims of Stalinist Repressions, cannot even afford new shoes.
When asked what Norilsk was for him, he answered, ""a grave"".
But he is not a dead soul.
""People related better to each other in the old days -- they were kinder and more spiritual.
""Everyone thought Stalin would die and we would survive this,"" he said with a smile. ""And that is what happened.""

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's delays in exporting platinum metals to an increasingly tight and edgy world market stem from a volatile cocktail of internal power struggles and bureaucratic foul-ups, industry sources said on Friday.
Few Western traders and analysts believed Moscow was intentionally withholding supplies in order to boost the market, which earlier this month saw palladium prices at 17-year highs and platinum at a seven-year peak.
Most Russian sources have said the delays in deliveries from the world's biggest supplier of palladium and second largest of platinum are due to problems with red tape in Moscow, and that no larger issues are at play.
But Western industry analysts say in-fighting among state bodies for control over Russia's multi-billion-dollar white metal exports is probably a major factor.
""I believe it started out as a power struggle and has been considerably exacerbated by red tape,"" said Rhona O'Connell, precious metals analyst at T Hoare &amp; Co in London.
Two other Western analysts said it was unlikely Russia had left the market just to boost prices, as it did in the 1970s.
""They understand what can happen when you meddle in the market,"" said one London analyst, referring to a time when Russian supply delays backfired because Western electrical companies simply turned to silver instead.
Russia's senior metals officials have taken refuge behind a wall of silence on the delays, now running at five months.
Russia accounts for nearly two thirds of the world's palladium supply and around 20 percent of platinum deliveries. At one point this year prices for palladium, used in catalytic converters, electronics and dentistry, doubled to $240.00 an ounce.
Sister metal platinum rose 20 percent in the first week of June to around $500.00 an ounce but have since slipped back to around $416.
""There was a period, after the reorganisation of (state strategic reserve) Gokhran and the functions of the Economy Ministry in this area, when it took time to sort out quota and licensing procedures,"" said a source at Almazjuvelirexport, the state agency exporting the metals.
Almaz completed talks in mid-June with buyers in Japan, the world's largest consumer of platinum and palladium. But after quoting Japanese buyers various possible dates for the resumption of exports and leaving markets guessing on when it would start deliveries, Almaz has clammed up.
""Mr Berlin does not wish to give any comments on the situation,"" said an employee, referring to Vitaly Berlin, the head of Almaz's platinum unit.
One Almaz source again cited red tape, saying, ""It would be fair to say technical, bureaucratic procedures are to blame.""
The Russian institutions involved in precious metals have undergone major changes in the past 12 or so months. Gokhran, now GosFond, is no longer under the aegis of Roskomdragmet and is administered by the Economy and Finance Ministries.
Roskomdragmet, the former state committee for precious metals and precious stones, was disbanded in mid-1996. A sweeping government reshuffle in March in effect disbanded the Industry Ministry, which had jurisdiction over precious metals output.
But one official disagreed with the red tape theory.
""This is disinformation -- Almaz has no bureaucratic problems,"" said Yuri Boikin, deputy head of the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry's foreign economic activities department.
""Almaz has a government order to sell -- when it does that is its problem. They can do it whenever they want. On the second day after getting the quota they can get a general licence. Why they haven't prepared documents and contracts is their problem.""
Western markets also question how much Russia's stockpiles have dwindled in the past three or four years on strong exports.
""The general sense is that they've got plenty of palladium but that platinum could be running short,"" one source said, quoting a second trader who thought Russia had only six months of platinum left.
One London trader said Almaz was ready to export in March but that President Boris Yeltsin disbanded the Industry Ministry that month and that the central bank may have heated up the campaign for control over the marketing of Russia's white metals.

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's plans to cut electricity tariffs for good payers could jolt its giant aluminium industry, the world's largest exporter of the non-ferrous metal, into bigger profits, officials and analysts said on Monday.
But not all plants, they said, would benefit equally.
""Well, this is certainly a pretty good development,"" said Galina Stelmakova, deputy director for development and investments at Kontsern Alyuminiy, the Russian producers' group. ""It will streamline the economic situations at smelters.
Fuel and Energy Minister Boris Nemtsov, in charge of revamping natural monopolies in the energy and transport sectors, said earlier that electricity tariffs for domestic industry would drop by up to 30 percent from July.
Nemtsov said only users which paid on time for supplies would be eligible for the lower tariffs -- a condition many, but not all, Russian smelters meet.
Industry officials said that with electricity accounting for about 25 percent of the cost of producing a tonne of primary aluminium in Russia, lower power tariffs could help profits.
Yuri Shlaifshtein, a board member at Bratsk, the world's largest primary aluminium smelter, said leaner tariffs could help the Siberian plant's longterm plans to attract foreign investment for modernisation.
""I can only welcome this decision,"" he said by telephone, adding Bratsk always paid on time, in cash, for its electricity supplies. ""This won't affect our general production levels but it will make them more stable over the longterm.""
Russia, home to the world's largest smelters, exported 2.44 million tonnes of primary aluminium last year, the most of any producing country. Its total output was 2.87 million tonnes.
The reduction in power costs are not likely to be felt evenly, since different regions have different rates. The so-called European part of Russia, where only about 15 percent of Russia's aluminium is produced, pays the highest tariffs.
Irkutsk, another large East Siberian smelter, pays about 10 percent of its per-tonne production cost of $1,200 for electricity. In sharp contrast, the European smelters pay up to $600 for electricity for each tonne.
Boris Arlyuk of St Petersburg, Russia-based Alumconsult said the rate cuts would help the Kandalaksha, Nadvoisky and Volgograd smelters in the European part of Russia most of all, since those plants had the highest energy costs.
But they were also the least solvent, paying for electricity with metal or promissory notes, and might not be able to produce cash up front as Nemtsov wanted, he said.
Russian smelters are struggling to secure longterm electricity supply contracts to increase profits and plan for the future.
Nemstov's rate cuts are part of a wider drive by Moscow to spark life into industrial output in general, which has plummeted in the years since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Ironically, electricity rate cuts could benefit the Siberian smelters the least, since some of them may have already secured longterm supply contracts with regional hydroelectrical plants.
""Now if we can just get the government to agree to a lower tariff for three years,"" Shlaifshtein added. ""And then get it to do the same thing for railway tariffs.""
Nemtsov, a young reformer who is also a first deputy prime minister, has also promised to cut rail tariffs -- a move the smelters would welcome.
Industry officials have said the cost of transporting Russian metal to world markets is more than twice the Western industry average of around 24 percent.
Kontsern Alyuminiy said in March that average Russian smelter profit margins had fallen to one percent in 1996 from 16 percent two years before.

LynnleyBrowning,"Russian oil barons are battling for control of Rosneft, one of the last big energy firms not yet privatised, in a tussle that could alter Western investments in this energy frontier, industry sources said on Monday.
The sources, who asked not to be named, said rival Russian oil company Sibneft, widely known to be controlled by prominent financier and politician Boris Berezovsky, was making a play for Rosneft, the rough diamond of the Russian energy sector.
""Berezovsky plans to merge the two companies,"" said a highly placed Russian energy official close to the matter. ""It's part of a plan to control revenue flows from (Rosneft's) exports.""
Sibneft spokesman Filipp Murashkov said Rosneft was one of six energy companies Sibneft was considering acquiring but would not say whether the mini-major would actually make a play.
""The company's (Sibneft's) management is analysing the possibility of acquiring one of these oil companies and is assessing its overall needs,"" he said by telephone. ""What that will result in, I cannot tell you now."" He said Sibneft's board would take a decision in coming weeks.
Russia's former oil production associations are now independent companies, most of them privatised and many of them among the world's largest in terms of oil reserves.
Rosneft's key draws are its status as the recipient of state offtake in all production-sharing deals and its significant equity stakes in $40 billion worth of energy projects with foreign oil companies.
But the company has many deadweight liabilities, including dozens of research institutes and defunct equipment producers.
Still, Rosneft is part of three deals off Russia's Far East island of Sakhalin requiring total investments from Japanese and U.S. partners of around $22 billion. In Sakhalin-I, due to begin output right after the turn of the century, one Rosneft unit has a 17 percent interest while a second affiliate has 23 percent.
Rosneft also has a 7.5 percent stake in the $2 billion Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which will build a new oil export pipeline from Kazakhstan to Russia, and a 20 percent stake in the $20 billion international Timan-Pechora Company project.
""This is more than just a corporate battle,"" said one of the Russian sources. ""Rosneft is going to start reeking of money very soon, and Sibneft's owner senses this.""
Rosneft's privileged position could introduce a new variable into the tortuous negotiations foreign energy firms go through to try to get oil deals in Russia off the ground.
A senior Western energy executive said Rosneft's status as representative of the government in output-sharing deals was unclear and he was unsure of its effect on stalled projects.
One of the Russian sources said Rosneft had once been in preliminary talks with Exxon Corp, Amoco Corp and Total of France on possible strategic alliances but that talks could not proceed until Rosneft's fate was decided.
""For the (international) majors, Rosneft is not a hypothetical partner now,"" the source said.
Berezovsky, through Rosneft's new, government-appointed president, Yuri Bespalov, has undertaken a sweeping overhaul of Rosneft managers, replacing half a dozen powerful department heads, including Valentin Zlatov, who oversaw exports. Rosneft vice-presidents and deputy chairmen are no longer empowered to conduct negotiations with foreign partners or to sign contracts.
Sources said Sibneft, whose main production unit is Noyabrskneftegaz, was positioning, possibly through an unknown affiliate, to place a winning bid for Rosneft in a forthcoming auction of the company's shares.
""I keep hearing from many Russians that Berezovsky is definitely going for Rosneft,"" said the Western oil executive. ""There is a sense now that it's much more certain.""
Moscow has held sales of prize stakes in privatised oil companies but nearly all of them have been won by what appear to be pre-determined winners allied with the company being sold.
The original privatisation plan for Rosneft, Russia's 10th largest producer with 1996 output of 262,000 barrels per day, calls for 47 percent to be auctioned off. The state would retain 51 percent while workers would get two percent.
Rosneft, which Moscow once envisioned as Russia's national oil company, has wanted to emulate the success of its private competitors, like LUKoil. Senior Rosneft officials once begged to be described as a private oil company, even though it is still 100 percent state-owned.

LynnleyBrowning,"Russia's Gazprom, the world's largest gas company and a corporate empire with the power of a state, has not seen big economic troubles at home hurt its ability to raise money abroad.
Energy analysts, speaking on Friday one day before RAO Gazprom holds its annual shareholders' meeting, said Russia's arguably most powerful company would use the event to declare an end to a tussle with the government over the company's role in the economy and to solidify investor confidence.
""Nonpayments problems depress Gazprom's collection rate and undermine its overall profitability,"" said analyst Yuri Butayev of Renaissance Capital. ""But the company is attractive, regardless,"" he said, citing its huge reserves and exports to Europe. ""It's absolutely unique.""
Gazprom, struggling to emerge from a severe nonpayments crisis which has left most Russian enterprises crippled, goes into the meeting on the heels of major capital raising plans and a clean slate before tax authorities.
The company faces a major problem in getting domestic customers to pay.
But some analysts said the problem had still not dented the company's fundamentals and cash flows from exports were strong.
""It's raised more capital abroad than any other Russian company,"" said energy analyst Ivan Mazalov of CentreInvest Group consultancy in Moscow, adding Gazprom's reserves and exports were the company's top positive factors. ""Foreign credit institutions are very confident of Gazprom's ability to repay.""
The monopoly is a corporate and political force in Russia, where it accounted for a vast 26 percent of the country's 1996 tax revenues and heats a nation of voters.
But Gazprom, once a ministry and once run by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, faced attacks earlier this year by cabinet officials, who were once the company's unquestioning supporters but are now desperate for cash to plug the deficit.
Gazprom's biggest problem is that it gets paid for only 60 percent of the gas it sells at home, and then mostly by barter.
The low rate made it fall behind in its tax payments, but it finally paid off its final $608 million in tax arrears this week and can now try to raise more money abroad for costly production and export projects.
But how Gazprom's international auditor Price Waterhouse will value the barter, and thus the company, which had 1996 pre-tax profit of 45 trillion roubles ($7.8 billion), is unknown.
""It's difficult to say what the company will be worth,"" said Butayev. ""There exist big discrepancies with the collection rate and how you convert barter into cash.""
Analysts said Gazprom was unlikely to use the annual meeting to announce radical changes to its strategy.
""The one significant piece of information we're waiting for is the international accounts standards, "" said Butayev, referring to the question of just how rich the wealthy company is. ""But I don't think they'll release them at the meeting.
""Otherwise, there will be no big surprises as far as the fundamentals are concerned.""
The fundamentals for Gazprom, which has 34 percent of world gas reserves, 27 percent of annual global output and accounts for 60 percent of Europe's gas imports, are good.
Gazprom plans to issue two $1 billion Eurobonds and a $1 billion convertible bond by early 1998. It plans a second tranche of its wildly-successful American Depositary Shares (ADSs) next year and has mandated Credit Lyonnais and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson to organise a bridging loan of $1.2 billion and medium term credits of $2.5-$3.0 billion.
Gazprom, 40 percent state-owned, plans to offer nine percent of its equity to foreign investors. Gazprom's market capitalisation has doubled this year to $16.5 billion.
Ekho-Moskvy radio said influential financier and politician Boris Berezovsky, a force in Russia's oil sector and member of the Security Council, was lobbying to join Gazprom's board.
Abroad, Gazprom is looking to double its gas exports to Europe by 2010 via its $40 billion Yamal production and pipeline project -- plans requiring financing which in turn requires Gazprom not bicker with the government about taxes.
""Gazprom is a state within a state, and it's in its best interests to cooperate with the government,"" Butayev said. ""The company is a pragmatist.""

MarcelMichelson,"France Telecom has been ordered by France's new telecommunications supervisor to review a proposal for a list of prices it will charge its future competitors for the use of parts of its infrastructure.
""We have had a meeting will all the operators yesterday. We are waiting for a new proposal by France Telecom,"" Jean-Michel Hubert, president of the new ART regulator, said during the body's first news conference on Thursday.
The catalogue of so-called interconnection charges is going to be a key element both for the economic viability of future entrants into the French market as well as for the value of France Telecom, slated for partial privatisation this spring in the biggest French market float ever.
Hubert said that he hoped to be able to render opinion of the Autorite de Regulation des Telecommunications (ART) on the draft decree on interconnection at the start of February.
Telecommunications Minister Francois Fillon aims to publish the final decree before the end of that month.
As far as the actual price list is concerned he hoped the five-strong body could take a decision ""as soon as possible"" and added it should be before the partial sale of France Telecom.
He declined to be specific about what kind of changes ART was asking from France Telecom -- the other operators are demanding drastic price cuts from an original proposal -- only saying that he wanted to be ""equitable"".
Hubert noted that there was ""only a small window"" between a price structure at which competition was impossible and another at which competition would be ""ridiculous"".
He added that while ART would take account of international comparisons, because he believed there would be a move to harmonise these costs internationally, he said such a comparison should not be the norm for a decision.
ART started its legal life on January 6, taking over the regulatory and licencing authorities that were previously the prerogative of the Ministry of Telecommunications.
ART is indepedent and will also have to act as an arbitrator in case of disputes between various operators.
Its five members -- appointed by the presidents of the republic, senate and parliament -- cannot be sacked nor can they seek a new term. Apart from Hubert, the members are Dominique Roux, Yvon Le Bars, Roger Chinaud and Bernard Zuber.
Hubert said that a difference with Britain's OFTEL was that ART will take decisions as a college while at OFTEL the director-general has the decision-making power.
Asked whether ART would make life as difficult for France Telecom as OFTEL has made that of British Telecom Plc, Hubert said only that he expected ""hard and difficult talks with all operators.""
Hubert said he wanted to promote growth of the market, which would boost economic growth and jobs. He said he had the interests of the consumer in mind and noted the existence of ART alone as an unbiased regulator was an incentive to competition.
But he made it clear that ART would also come to the aid of France Telecom, or other French operators, as far as international matters were concerned. ART still needs to appoint a director of international affairs but Hubert said the matter was very important and had to be based on reciprocity -- if French operators find obstacles abroad, ART could be engaged in the negotiations.
Hubert is travelling to London on Monday to meet OFTEL's Don Cruickshank and other international counterparts. He said much of the international negotiations would need to be done on a European level while the EU member states would want to harmonise their regulation in a single telecoms market.
Hubert said that ART was following closely discussions between France Telecom, Generale des Eaux unit SFR and Bougues Telecom about the cost of interconnecting mobile telecommunications but said ART had not been asked to arbitrate in the matter.
""I hope the operators come to an agreement,"" he said.

MarcelMichelson,"France Telecom said on Monday it had taken full control of Keystone Communications, a major U.S. television uplink company, to strengthen its position in the North American television market.
Michel Combes, director general of France Telecom's audiovisual transmisson activities, said the acquisition for less than $100 million gave the company a prestigious client list of the U.S. majors as well as an enhanced position in Asia.
""The acquisition boosts our position on the North American market where our main rival is VIVX Global Access,"" Combes said by telephone from Cannes where he is attending the MIDEM audiovisual market fair.
France Telecom, through its Telediffusion De France (TDF) unit, is already leader in the European market with a 20 percent stake, ahead of British Telecommunications Plc and has an estimated 15 percent in the world market. Keystone has a 20 percent share of the North American market.
The market for audiovisual transmission -- the service of carrying television pictures from an event or studio to the broadcasting centre -- is estimated at eight billion francs ($1.5 billion) and seen growing by eight percent per year.
The market of broadcasting pictures to the homes, both direct to home as well as to cable company receivers, is also seen at some eight billion francs.
Total sales of the unit are two billion francs.
This market stands to grow rapidly with the take-off of digital satellite television companies.
France Telecom is partner and service provider to the Television Par Satellite (TPS) digital satellite television venture with TF1, France Television, Lyonnaise des Eaux and Luxembourg's Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Television (CLT).
Combes said that while the world market was seen growing by eight percent, this growth was less pronounced in Europe while Asia would increase at a quicker pace.
TDF has a pact with Japan's KDD as well as NHK and is service provider to Hong Kong's television company.
He said France Telecom wanted ""to have a foothold in Asia"" which he called an ""interesting market with good growth potential"" but he declined to comment on whether to company would make an acquisition soon in the area.
""It is increasingly important that you can provide services for your television clients from whatever place in the world, be it for news or sport,"" Combes said.
France Telecom already had a 40 percent stake in Keystone and bought the remainder from Simmons Group. Together with its Maxat British unit, the three companies are now offering international services under the name ""Global Skylink"".
France Telecom, official operator for the 1998 World Soccer Championships, also has a 20 percent stake in TBA in Argentina.

MarcelMichelson,"Franco-Italian semiconductor group SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV on Wednesday reported a 19 percent rise in 1996 earnings to $625.5 million but warned about the first quarter of 1997 after a weak end to last year.
The profit warning and lower fourth quarter results took the market by surprise and the share closed nearly 12 percent lower at 379.40 francs in Paris in a turnover of 542 million francs ($98 million).
The French blue-chip index closed 1.35 percent higher.
""There is an awful lot of profit-taking. Now that it is falling 12 percent people are seeing a disaster, but it has been rising a lot in January,"" said a dealer.
SGS-Thomson has been steadily climbing from 154.50 francs in July to 433 francs on January 20, with the rise accelerated earlier this month when Intel Corp reported a big rise in quartely profits.
At SGS-Thomson, the fourth quarter earnings were down by 15.5 percent to $142 million.
President and chief executive Pasquale Pistorio said he was pleased with the 1996 performance. He was cautious about the first quarter of 1997 although he said the company would still outperform the industry average.
""With lead times shrinking throughout the industry, we are entering the first quarter of 1997 with less order visibility than we have historically enjoyed,"" he said.
""From what we know today, we expect 1997 first quarter revenues to be close to third quarter 1996 levels. We also anticipate that overall pricing pressures will continue, and therefore, in spite of productivity improvements, gross margins could be slightly below fourth quarter 1996 levels.""
In the third quarter, net revenues were $988.4 million.
""While first quarter conditions continue to be uncertain, we believe that subsequent quarters of 1997 will show progressive improvement compared to the 1997 first quarter as the company continues to emphasise differentiated products and high growth applications,"" Pistorio added.
""Recent contracts with key customers and new design wins in such high growth areas as hard disk drives, set-top boxes and digital cellular phones give us confidence that SGS-Thomson will continue to outperform the industry average in 1997.""
Company chief economist Jean-Phillipe Dauvin said the world semiconductor market had fallen by eight percent in 1996 which made it the third worst year on record for the industry.
The fall was to a large extent due to price pressures, with prices of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips plunging by 80 to 90 percent, causing losses at many chipmakers.
SGS-Thomson does not make DRAMs, however, but dedicated chips which shielded it somewhat from the price erosion. Its market rose by five percent.
Dauvin said that market research bureaux WSTS, Dataquest and VLSI Research were predicting a 1997 market increase ranging from respectively 7.4 percent to 14.9 percent.
""In 1997 there will probably be a slight recovery but we will not see a big upturn until 1998. It is possible that we have to postpone the start of the recovery from June-July to the second half of 1997,"" Dauvin added.
In 1996, according to Dataquest estimates, SGS-Thomson moved to the ninth place in the world ranking from 14 in 1995, being the sole chip maker with Intel to show significant sales growth.
Dauvin said he maintained his forecast that the chip market would be worth $300 billion in 2000, against $133 billion now. ($1=5.547 French Franc)

Full year revenues rose to $4.12 billion from $3.55 billion. Capital expenditure rose to $1.12 billion from $1.0 billion and research and development spending was up by 21 percent to $532.30 million, or 12.9 percent of sales.
The Le Monde newspaper recently said that French Industry Minister Franck Borotra wanted to reduce the French stake in the company, which is held by France Telecom, CEA-Industrie and Thomson-CSF.
The Industry Ministry has no official comment.

MarcelMichelson,"The French telecommunications market, which opens to full competition in 1998, seems be hotting up despite denials that Nippon Telecom and Telegraph Co (NTT) will enter the fray, analysts said on Thursday.
Whether the NTT story was correct or not, 1997 would be full of alliances and deals, they said. ""If you want to be in France after liberalisation, you have to make your move now,"" a Paris-based analyst said.
The Financial Times newspaper reported that NTT was planning to spend $500 million to take a 10 percent stake in Cegetel alongside British Telecom Plc.
But a spokesman for Cegetel, the company aiming to rival France Telecom as a national operator in 1998, said no changes were planned in its shareholding capital.
""The capital make-up of Cegetel will be the one we announced in September with British Telecom, Mannesmann and SBC Communications Inc,"" said a spokesman of the joint venture controlled by Generale des Eaux.
BT will have around 25 percent, SBC 15 percent and Mannesmann 10 percent.
In Tokyo, NTT said it was not considering investing in the French telecoms market. ""We're not in a situation to positively consider any such action. Everything is up in the air,"" a spokesman told Reuters.
Cegetel had previously said there might be marginal changes in the shareholdings. But in Paris the spokesman said: ""They are about to be fixed and it's roughly like we have announced them.""
From January 1, 1998, when the European telecommunications market is liberalised, France Telecom will lose the last vestiges of its monopoly.
It will still be majority state-owned, after a partial flotation this year, and will be responsible for the so-called ""public service"" of telecommunications, but other companies will be able to apply for operating licences.
An independent regulator, l'Autorite de Regulation des Telecommunications (ART), will oversee the market.
Cegetel is so far the only big grouping to have announced its intention to set up against France Telecom as a national operator. The company already runs France's second biggest mobile telecommunications network, SFR.
Bouygues Telecom has teamed up with VEBA of Germany and STET of Italy for telecoms ventures but it has not yet detailed how far its ambitions stretch beyond mobile telecommunications and business services.
Waiting in the wings are Unisource and AT &amp; T.
Unisource, a joint venture of Dutch PTT, Telia of Sweden, Swiss Telecom PTT and Spain's Telefonica, was previously a Generale des Eaux partner but they broke up after the Cegetel deal with BT.
U.S. giant AT &amp; T, which has not hidden its ambition to be a big player in all the main European telecommunications markets, is concluding the Uniworld alliance with Unisource.
On Thursday AT &amp; T and Unisource teamed up with Mannesmann for the German telecommunications market.
France Telecom itself is allied to Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp of the United States.
Smaller rivals, operating on target markets in France, are MFS Communications and Colt Telecom Plc of Britain as well as a telecoms subsidiary of Eurotunnel SA/Plc.
MFS's new owner WorldCom Inc has recently stated its intention to obtain a licence as national operator.

MarcelMichelson,"French books-to-missiles conglomerate Lagardere Groupe said on Tuesday it does not expect to make a profit on its ambitious multimedia activities until 1998, despite leading market positions in the U.S. and France.
Arnaud Lagardere, the son of founder Jean-Luc Lagardere and the New York-based head of the multimedia (Grolier) activities, told a news conference that while the results were improving, there would still be a loss for 1996 and 1997.
""We will hit the break-even point during 1997 and 1998 will be the first full year that we will be above break-even,"" Lagardere said. ""In 1996 our contribution to the group will be slightly negative but it will be an improvement over the previous year,"" he added.
Grolier, the number two interactive encyclopaedia publisher in the U.S. behind Microsoft and owner of Hachette and Filipacchi and titels such as Elle, is the largest content contributor to America Online in the U.S.
It has annual sales of some 2.5 billion french francs ($448 million).
Lagardere is also the owner of the Club Internet access provider which is number three in France behind CompuServe and AOL and has big ambitions for the Intranet market of closed web services for companies.
""1997 will be the year of the Intranet in Europe,"" Lagardere said, pointing out that while Europe was lagging behind the U.S. with only 22 percent of companies having such a service, the majority of companies was planning to start such a service.
That is where the hardware people of Lagardere come in.
Noel Forgeard, chairman of the Matra Defence Espace unit which is vying for state-owned Thomson-CSF, said the company would try to find investors and industrial partners for a multimedia satellite project targeted for 2005.
Lagardere is already partner in the Orion satellite project and its MCNSAT service can provide high-capacity internet and multimedia transport for companies.
The company is currently working on two projects, called ""TurboPC"" and ""West"", which would turn digital television sets into stand-alone internet computers.
The TurboPC project envisages that computers can receive information from a satellite through a small dish -- like the ones to be used for digital satellite television.
In the first instance, the so-called return line remains ""terrestial"" via a telephone line.
With ""West"", a series of at least three satellites would allow computers to use the satellite for the return as well.
Forgeard declined to speculate on the investments needed, saying these K-band satellites were not comparable to mobile telecommunication satellite projects such as IRIDIUM which plans to launch 66 low-orbit satellites and has raised $2.65 billion.
Forgeard said Lagardere would need to find investors and telecommunications operators to participate in the project.
""It is far too premature to speculate about the investments needed,"" he said.
Arnaud Lagardere added that while the project was ambitious the company would not engage in investments or take on risks that would ""put the group into danger"".

MarcelMichelson,"French energy group Total SA on Wednesday reported a 50 percent rise in its 1996 net income to 5.6 billion francs ($1 billion), boosted by higher oil prices, a firmer dollar, improved refining margins and productivity gains.
The profit figure, which was in line with financial analysts' expectations, would have shown a 150 percent increase if 1995 special charges of 1.5 billion francs were taken into account.
Operating income rose by 37 percent to 10.2 billion francs on 30 percent higher sales of 176 billion francs.
Total chairman Thierry Desmarest said the profit improvement compared with rises of some 25 percent at U.S. oil majors.
Larger French group Elf in December said its 1996 net income would be between 7.3 and 7.5 billion francs compared with 5.3 billion in 1995, or some 40 percent higher.
Total shares initially rose on the figures but closed down 0.55 percent at 471.50 francs while the CAC-40 blue chip index was down 0.71 percent.
""The market had anticipated the increase in results. The figures were in line with expectations,"" an analyst said.
Total said that external factors had contributed two billion francs to the rise in operating income.
""A more favourable operating environment in 1996 than 1995 accounts for more than half of (the) 3.3 billion franc increase in operating income,"" Total said.
The U.S. dollar rose to an average rate of 4.99 francs in 1995 to 5.12 francs in 1996, Brent oil rose to 20.7 per barrel from $17.04 per barrel while the refining margins improved to $13.6 per tonne from $11.4 per tonne.
Productivity gains contributed 500 million francs to the improvement and higher volumes 1.1 billion. An increase in operating expenses trimmed the total gain by 300 million.
Desmarest said he expected the oil price to slip in 1997, due to the return of Iraq to the market and higher production by non OPEC members, but he expected it not to fall as far as the 1994/1995 low of $16.40 a barrel.
""I do not think that we will continue to see the favourable prices from the start of the year,"" Desmarest said. ""But it is very unlikely that it will return to a level of $16.40 per barrel.""
Total expects a further increase in profits but Desmarest declined to be drawn into precise forecasts.
""Continuing production growth and ongoing productivity gains projected over the next few years should allow the company to improve profitability relative to the 1996 level of return on equity."" Total said.
Desmarest told the news conference that he aimed to get a four billion franc increase in the years up to 1999. ""For the next three years, and with unchanged circumstances, we aim to improve the operating results by four billion francs,"" he said.
Total aims to boost its investments in 1997 to 18 billion francs, from 16 billion in 1995, with the lion's share going to upstream activities -- exploration and production.
Desmarest said that by the year 2000, he expected about half of the company's operating income to come from exploration and production, while both the downstream and chemicals activities would have a slice of 20 to 25 percent.
Total aims to have reserves to allow it to tap into more than one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year 2000 and planned further growth after that.
In downstream, refining and marketing, Total is still faced with a weak European market.
Desmarest said the company was ready to participate in a restructuring of the refining industry but he did not plan to shut Total's refineries. Instead he was willing to offer access to the refineries to other operators in exchange for closures.

MarcelMichelson,"France's Rhone-Poulenc SA said on Thursday its 1996 net income grew 28.4 percent to 2.74 billion francs ($494.9 million), but called this an insufficient level.
Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou denied market rumours the company was on the look-out for acquisitions, sought a merger or planned to split its chemicals and pharmaceuticals activities.
He told a news conference the group would focus on internal growth and he maintained his target of an increase in 1997 earnings per share of 20 percent, before exceptionals, from 8.44 francs in 1996.
Fourtou said the group would in 1997 exceed its planned two-year asset sale programme of 10 billion francs, which stood at 6.8 billion at the end of 1996, and would slash debt to below 50 percent of equity, from 61 in 1996 and 72 in 1995.
Sales were three percent higher at 85.82 billion francs and operating income rose 38.5 percent to 6.892 billion. The gross dividend was increased by 16.7 percent to 5.25 francs per share.
The profit figure was in line with analysts' expectations and Rhone-Poulenc shares closed 0.39 percent lower at 179.80 francs while the CAC-40 blue-chip index was up 1.54 percent.
""This is an encouraging figure, but it remains insufficient for a company of our size,"" Fourtou said about the profit.
He said there were three negative elements in the group's results -- the recall of albumin products at Centeon, a worldwide crisis in polyester which reduced operating income by 700 million francs, and a very low price of titanium oxide which had a 500 million franc negative impact.
Centeon is a 50-50 joint venture between Germany's Hoechst AG and Rhone's 68 percent-owned pharmaceuticals unit Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
Finance director Jean-Pierre Tirouflet said that while the negative effects would persist in the first quarter and perhaps first half of 1997, he saw an improvement in operating results of these activities.
Fourtou said that while improving profitablilty and cutting debt was his main priority, he dismissed rumours of a merger, split-up or capital increase.
""I can confirm we do not plan a major acquisition in 1997. We have never had so many opportunities for internal growth,"" he said. ""I can also confirm that we have no plans for a capital increase, as is being rumored, nor do we envisage a de-merger.""
He said later that his company was not interested in buying Elf Aquitaine's health and beauty unit Sanofi nor in linking up with this company.
""Firstly, as far as I understand, Sanofi is not for sale. But Elf has said it is willing to go below 50 percent,"" he said. ""I want to make clear that we are not interested in an acquisition of Sanofi nor in a link-up with this company.""
Fourtou added that while Rhone wanted better access to the Japanese and other Far Eastern markets, the company had dropped its previous goal of finding a Japanese takeover candidate and was now focusing on joint ventures.

MarcelMichelson,"The French government is moving edgily towards a key decision for the future of Europe's defence industry -- whether to privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF through a public sale or private placement.
The stakes are huge, as the choice of the method of sale will to a large extent determine the final outcome of a far-reaching restructuring in the French defence industry and has major implications for the entire sector in Europe.
Like a master chess player, the state must look several moves ahead, decide what sort of defence industry it wants to see in a few years' time, and ensure the decision will be seen as fair to all involved.
Government sources said on Friday that the decision, originally expected at the end of January, would probably slip into early February because the government was studying in great detail all the elements of the politically-sensitive dossier that involves Europe's biggest defence electronics company.
""The decision will be taken shortly, but not today. We are still studying all possibilities,"" said an official source.
""The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet. At the moment there is no proposal to send to the ministers. I could not tell you when exactly that will happen,"" he added.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe is anxious to avoid another embarassment like the one he suffered on December 4 when the government had to suspend an earlier privatisation plan under which Thomson-CSF would have gone to conglomerate French Lagardere Groupe.
That deal involved the privatisation of the Thomson group, which included both a 68 percent stake in Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
The state was forced to call off the plan because the independent privatisation commission balked at the terms of a sale of TMM to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
The cancellation outraged the Korean, who called the decision racist and prompted an angry call for explanation from President Kim Young-sam.
Since then the French government has decided to separate the sales of TMM and Thomson-CSF.
The ultimate aim of the government is to have a strong defence industry able to supply its armed forces with state-of-the art weaponry and play a leading role in Europe and on the world scene.
A year ago, President Jacques Chirac announced a wide-ranging restructuring of the French defence industry around a merged group of Aerospatialeand Dassault Aviation for aerospace, and Thomson-CSF for electronics.
With a public sale through a market float, Thomson-CSF management will have its hands free to pursue its own negotiations about future alliances while interested partners can acquire stakes on the market.
But this may mean that a foreign cash-rich group from elsewhere in Europe or from the U.S. or Asia could buy itself into the talks.
With a private placement there are two main options.
One is by choosing candidates for a sale using a ""cahier de charges"" -- a sort of bidding book comprising price, intended strategy and commitments on jobs and investments.
This would leave the government with the biggest influence on the outcome, but also with the biggest responsibilty.
Another procedure, rare in France, would be to auction the state's 68-percent stake in Thomson-CSF among qualified bidders, putting the emphasis on price and ensuring the greatest possible revenues for the state at a time France is trying to reduce its public deficits ahead of monetary union.

MarcelMichelson,"French conglomerate Generale des Eaux looks set to extend its power in the media after revealing on Monday it was in talks with Havas primarily about pay-television firm Canal Plus.
""Havas and Compagnie Generale des Eaux confirm discussions are now in progress concerning their respective interests in audiovisual activities, primarily Canal Plus,"" said a joint statement from Generale des Eaux and Havas.
The announcement, rushed out before the stock exchange opened, followed press reports that the companies were preparing a deal which would make Generale des Eaux the key shareholder in Havas. That, in turn, would make the Havas media group the biggest shareholder in Canal Plus.
The companies added that they would not comment further pending board meetings scheduled for February 6.
The prospect of a major transformation of the French media landscape gained weight when a corporate source confirmed that Alcatel Alsthom was in talks about a possible sale of part of its 21.2 percent stake in Havas to Generale des Eaux.
Generale des Eaux, already a powerful force in the water and telecommmunications industry, owns almost 20 percent of Canal Plus. The satellite broadcaster is itself merging with fellow-pay-TV group Nethold to create Europe's largest subscription television company.
""The big winner is (Generale des Eaux chairman) Jean-marie Messier who will find himself at the top of a pyramid in the French audiovisual sector,"" said an analyst at Paribas.
According to French newspapers, Generale des Eaux would transfer its Canal Plus stake to Havas, almost doubling Havas's current 21.6 percent stake in the broadcaster. Havas would then increase its own capital to allow Generale des Eaux a bigger stake.
Other major shareholders in Canal Plus are the bank Societe Generale with 4.5 percent, and the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations with 6.9 percent.
Generale des Eaux would also become indirectly the biggest shareholder in the merged Canal Plus company. Havas would establish its direct dominance within Canal Plus, well ahead of Nethold's owners, Richemont and MIH, which have 15 and 4.9 percent repectively.
Alcatel has owned 21.2 percent of Havas since selling its media business to Havas in 1995 in return for shares in Havas, which it was obliged to hold on to for at least two years.
The initial market reaction was broadly positive. Havas shares soared and those of Generale jumped too. ""It's a good deal for all parties involved,"" one share dealer said.
Alcatel stands to make a capital gain on the sale, as well as receiving cash, because the Havas share price has risen strongly over the past year in line with a French stock market which is at record highs.
Alcatel needs money to finance its planned acquisition, if the state permits it, of the government's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF.
The government is due to announce its Thomson-CSF sale plans shortly, after scrapping its original privatisation plan in December.
Newspapers have for months speculated about the Havas share structure, although Generale des Eaux has in the past denied plans to raise its stake.
On the share market, Havas shares opened eight percent higher but then gave up some of the gains to close 4.56 percent up at 424 francs.
Generale des Eaux was 1.55 percent up at 719, but Canal Plus was 0.42 percent lower at 1,177 and Alcatel slipped 1.09 percent to 542 francs.

MarcelMichelson,"Nobody expected Serge Tchuruk, chairman of electronics and telecommunications group Alcatel Alsthom, to sit and wait while the state made up its mind what to do with defence group Thomson-CSF.
But his audacious move to try and line-up state-owned aerospace group Aerospatiale and Rafale fighter plane builder Dassault came as a surprise to many.
Alcatel on Monday confirmed newspaper reports it was talking to the two plane makers about a Thomson offer.
The link, if successful, would group most of France's defence electronics industry players in one camp, with Lagardere Groupe's Matra Defense Espace in the other.
Other players, Sagem and Cie des Signaux, could join either camp at a later stage.
For Tchuruk's gamble to win, however, the government has to decide to sell its 58 percent stake in Thomson-CSF in a private placement, and not through a market float.
Alcatel Alsthom has defence businesses with some 10 billion francs in sales which would be transferred to Thomson-CSF, already a global player in defence electronics.
Aerospatiale and Dassault, themselves in advanced merger talks, would transfer their missiles and electronics business to Thomson-CSF in exchange for a stake in the group under the Alcatel scheme being discussed, industry sources said.
It would turn the remaining Aerospatiale-Dassault group into a pure aerospace ""platform"" company, with ties to one of the world's third biggest defence electronics groups.
The enlarged Thomson-CSF would have annual sales of 60 billion francs, against some 35 billion francs currently.
The government, as biggest shareholder in the future Aerospatiale-Dassault, has to allow this company to participate in a bid for another company majority-owned by the state.
The merger of Aerospatiale with Dassault is expected to be concluded before the spring, after which the new group will be privatised itself.
While the government has not publicly expressed its opinion on whether it would allow Aerospatiale to join a Thomson-CSF bid, it has had ample chances to express any opposition.
In December, when the first news reports appeared about a possible Aerospatiale/Dassault interest in Thomson-CSF, the Defence and Finance Ministries said such reports were ""without foundation"" and ""premature"".
Industry sources said that Tchuruk had informed all ministers involved about the possible link with the plane builders and they added that the fact Alcatel confirmed its discussions with the plane makers on Monday was a sign that Tchuruk had not been told to drop his plans.
Tchuruk, a 59-year old Marseille-born weapons engineer, had already impressed the independent Privatisation Commission with the industrial logic behind his group's Thomson-CSF bid.
But the government had in October selected Lagardere as preferred bidder because the Matra merger was the best solution for French defence interests.
Meanwhile, Alcatel has confirmed its return to profits in 1996 after heavy losses due to one-off charges in 1995.
It has sold its interests in mobile telecoms operator SFR and it is in talks to reduce its stake in Havas.
Whether that will help convince the government to change its mind remains the question.
On the Paris Bourse, Alcatel shares closed 1.09 percent lower -- after big gains late last week -- at 542 francs, while Lagardere fell 1.59 percent to 154.70 with traders citing concern it may not win Thomson.
"
MarcelMichelson,"Alcatel Alsthom said on Monday it was in talks with Aerospatiale and Dassault about a joint offer for the government's 58-percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF .
Prime Minister Alain Juppe said a decision about the procedure for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF would be made before the end of February.
""There are discussions with the companies mentioned in the press,"" an Alcatel spokesman said when asked to react to newspaper reports about a joint bid.
Industry sources said that Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk had kept the government informed about his plans to form an alliance with Aerospatiale and Dassault in order to win the Thomson-CSF stake.
An industry analyst, who prefered not to be named, said the new plan improved the credibility of Alcatel's offer.
Alcatel in October lost out to the Lagardere Groupe in bidding for state-controlled Thomson SA, which has a stake in Thomson-CSF as well as 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
But the government had to suspend the sale on December 4 after the independent Privatisation Commission rejected terms for the sale by Lagardere of TMM to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea.
A decision about the procedure for the relaunch of the sale, either by a private placement or a public sale, was originally expected at the end of January.
""I think that in the days to come, between now and the end of February, we will be in a position to announce very clearly the procedure, which I want to be as clear and as transparent as possible,"" Juppe said in an interview on French radio.
""All candidacies will obviously be examined in the context of the procedures we decide on,"" he said.
Dassault and Aerospatiale, which are currently in talks about a merger of their aircraft activities, had no comment.
President Jacques Chirac said a year ago that he wanted to restructure the French defence industry around a merger of Aerospatiale/Dassault and Thomson-CSF.
A joint bid by the aerospace group and Alcatel would speed up this restructuring. But the situation could be difficult because Aerospatiale is state-owned and the state would be the main shareholder of the merged group with Dassault.
""It is complicated but not impossible,"" an industry source said.
According to French newspapers, Aerospatiale would transfer its missiles and satellites business to Thomson-CSF and Dassault its electronics activties, now part of Dassault Electronique.
Alcatel would merge its own defence activities into Thomson-CSF. It would become the main shareholder of the enlarged group which would be Europe's biggest defence company and the world's third biggest after Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas Corp.
At Lagardere Groupe there was no immediate comment.
Lagardere shares closed 1.59 percent lower at 154.70 francs on the news of the strengthened Alcatel bid. Alcatel, which rose strongly last week, closed 1.09 percent lower at 542 francs.

MarcelMichelson,"French conglomerate Generale des Eaux looked set to extend its power in the media industry after revealing on Monday it was in talks with Havas, primarily about pay-television company Canal Plus.
""Havas and Compagnie Generale des Eaux confirm discussions are now in progress concerning their respective interests in audiovisual activities, primarily Canal Plus,"" said a joint statement from Generale des Eaux and Havas.
The announcement, which was rushed out before the stock exchange opened, followed press reports that the companies were preparing a deal which would make Generale des Eaux the key shareholder in Havas. That, in turn, would make the Havas media group the biggest shareholder in Canal Plus.
The companies added in a joint statement that they would not comment further pending board meetings scheduled for February 6.
The prospect of a major transformation of the French media landscape gained weight when a corporate source confirmed that Alcatel Alsthom was in talks about a possible sale of part of its 21.2 percent stake in Havas to Generale des Eaux.
Generale des Eaux, already a powerful force in the water and telecommmunications industry, owns almost 20 percent of Canal Plus. The satellite broadcaster is itself merging with fellow-pay-TV group Nethold to create Europe's largest subscription television company.
According to French newspapers, Generale des Eaux would transfer its Canal Plus stake into Havas, almost doubling Havas's current 21.6 percent stake in the broadcaster. Havas would then increase its own capital to allow Generale des Eaux a bigger stake.
Other major shareholders in Canal Plus are the bank Societe Generale, with 4.5 percent, and the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations with 6.9 percent.
Generale des Eaux would also become indirectly the biggest shareholder in the merged Canal Plus company. Havas would establish its direct dominance within Canal Plus, well ahead of Nethold's owners, Richemont and MIH, which have 15 and 4.9 percent repectively.
Alcatel has owned 21.2 percent of Havas since selling its media business to Havas in 1995 in return for shares in Havas, which it was obliged to hold on to for at least two years.
The initial market reaction was broadly positive. Havas shares soared and those of Generale jumped too. ""It's a good deal for all parties involved,"" one share dealer said.
Alcatel stands to make a capital gain on the sale, as well as receiving cash, because the Havas share price has increased a lot over the past year, in line with a French stock market which is at record highs.
Alcatel needs money to finance its planned acquisition, if the state permits it, of the government's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF.
The government is due to announce its Thomson-CSF sale plans shortly, after scrapping its original privatisation plan in December.
Newspapers have for months speculated about the Havas share structure, although Generale des Eaux has in the past denied plans to raise its stake.
On the share market, Havas shares opened up eight percent but then gave in some of the gains to trade 5.3 percent up at 427 francs.
Generale des Eaux was 0.7 percent up at 713, but Canal Plus was 0.93 percent lower at 1,171 and Alcatel slipped 0.55 percent to 545 francs.

MarcelMichelson,"Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said on Wednesday that French President Jacques Chirac was reluctant to allow private companies to use highly encrypted code for messages and transactions on the Internet.
""We had one problem with the U.S. government, now we have a second one with France,"" Gates told a news conference after meeting Chirac for more than an hour at the Elysee Palace.
""We should be able in France to use strong encryption,"" he added. Encryption makes messages and transactions safe on the Internet but also makes them harder to track by authorities.
Gates, who was in France as part of a European tour, also discussed education with Chirac and stressed the importance of computer literacy for future competitiveness.
""It's not the gap in Internet use (between the United States and Europe) of today that counts. It's the gap in 10 years' time that will be important,"" he said.
His private foundation will support European school computer projects with the first French projects expected in 1997.
Gates, perhap the richest man in the world, said he wanted to spend most of his wealth on such projects and charity. ""Ninety-five percent of my wealth will be returned to society, not to my heirs,"" he said.
In a keynote speech to the Comdex/IT forum computer show, Gates said an important feature for future Microsoft products would be simplicity to make computers easier to use.
He said that although in the past personal computer prices had remained stable while the machines' power and features increased dramatically, he now expected prices to come down.
Microsoft unveiled its Office 97 software package, integrating Internet and Intranet capabilities with its familiar productivity tools, at the show.
Jean-Philippe Courtois of Microsoft France said France ranked ninth in both the number of Internet users and web sites.
He said he expected three million personal computers to be sold in France in 1997 -- 700,000 of them to households.
Gates said only a small part of the installed computer base was linked up to the net and strong growth was to be expected. He also foresaw a mix between personal computers and television.
On that theme, Jacques Segela, vice president of Havas Advertising, said ads would become more personal and interactive than the broadly targetted and often blunt messages broadcast on television.
""In three years' time, people will invest more in ads on the net than on television,"" he said.
Roel Pieper, chief executive of Tandem Computers Inc., said an expected shift to Internet transactions from online transactions (like cash machines) would need secure, scalable clusters of computers and high-capacity telecommunications networks -- land lines as well as mobiles and pagers.
He said telecoms operators would be able to tap a new market in selling information about the use of their network, something which is already happening in the United States but breaches privacy laws in some European countries.
Herbert Budd, general manager Business Intelligence Solutions at IBM, told Reuters that many companies do not use the full potential of their data.
IBM and other companies are proposing to build data warehouses. IBM is also developing SurfAid, due out in the United States in the first half of 1997, to facilitate searches of text and data on the Internet.
Budd said such business solutions would represent a market of $30 billion in 2000, compared with between $6 and $8 billion currently.

MarkBendeich,"Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, urged Australia on Monday to press China into talks over the future of the remote Himalayan region and said he was ready to visit Beijing in the right ""atmosphere"".
Seen by Beijing as the leader of a pro-independence movement in Tibet, the Dalai Lama said he wanted to ask Australian Prime Minister John Howard to press China into opening a dialogue on the political future of Tibet.
""In case I have the opportunity of meeting (Howard), the main thing which I want to mention is...to appeal to the Australian government to help to materialise meaningful negotiations with the Chinese government,"" the Dalai Lama told a news conference in Melbourne.
A meeting with Howard, who returns from an overseas trip toward the end of the Dalai Lama's two-week trip, has yet to be arranged, but Howard has not ruled out talks despite warnings from Beijing against official contact with the Tibetan god king.
China has already chided New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger for meeting the Dalai Lama in Wellington last week.
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met the Dalai Lama on his arrival in Sydney on Saturday night, but said later that the talks were unofficial.
The Dalai Lama, exiled from Tibet since 1959, told the news conference the prospects for negotiations with Beijing had faded since his emissary met China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, partly due to domestic politics and frosty Sino-U.S. relations.
""At the moment the Chinese government, their main concern is to simply show the world and also their own people they are a big nation... No-one can influence them,"" he said.
The Dalai Lama, who wants a form of regional autonomy for Tibet, suggested that Beijing's ""one China-two systems"" policy governing its takeover of Hong Kong next year, and its goal of reunification with Taiwan, could serve as a model for Tibet.
""All these things are the more humane way,"" he said, adding he was ready to visit Beijing. ""As soon as some appropriate atmosphere develops, I am ready to visit China,"" he added.
The 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner also accused China of continuing to detain his seven-year-old spiritual deputy, the Panchen Lama.
""My Panchen Lama in effect is the youngest political prisoner. Seven years old. How sad,"" he said of Tibet's second holiest monk, believed to be the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama who died in Beijing in 1989.
""According to (my) information, he is somewhere near Beijing, as a prisoner under house arrest,"" the Dalai Lama said, adding that he feared for the boy's life.
China last month denied it was holding the boy but refused to recognise him as the 11th Panchen Lama. Beijing has instead installed its own new Panchen Lama, a boy of the same age.
""Tibetan Buddhist culture at the moment is facing a threat of extinction ...Whether intentionally or unintentionally, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place in our country,"" the Dalai Lama said.

MarkBendeich,"Australian retailer Coles Myer Ltd is praying a cold, wet winter will cheer up the group's struggling apparel business and add new growth to annual profit.
Chief executive Dennis Eck, speaking after Coles announced another firm rise in quarterly sales, said he remained cautious about the profit outlook for its three main apparel businesses.
""That (apparel) is the thing that most concerns us,"" Eck told Reuters on Thursday.  
Earlier, Coles posted a 6.5 percent rise in sales revenue to A$4.559 billion for the quarter ended April 27, bringing total sales for the year to date to A$14.5 billion, up 5.7 percent.
Coles' best-performing supermarkets division again led the result, recording a 12.3 percent jump in sales revenue for the quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago.
The group's once-struggling merchandise group, especially its Kmart chain of stores, also improved, posting a 5.8 percent rise in sales revenue, including fatter profit margins at Kmart.  
But sales at Coles' women's wear business, Katies, as well as its Target discount stores and its Myer Grace Bros department store chain, which both rely heavily on clothing sales, were all down.
Eck said fashion sales depended on extremes of weather and that a wet, cold winter could help revive them.
""I'm hoping for cold and rain for 20 more days and that would be nice,"" he said. ""It's a nice cold rainy day and May is when you really sell through your winter.""
A Sydney-based retail analyst agreed the weather had helped prolong weakness in Coles apparel sales.  
""One of the reasons why this quarter has been so bad (for apparel) is this incredible Indian summer we have been having, and fashion needs extremes of weather,"" he told Reuters.
Some economists have argued apparel sales are the victim of a long-term shift in spending patterns, with entertainment and other consumer items competing for household incomes.
But Eck defended Coles' apparel businesses and rejected a suggestion it sell Katies, its only speciality fashion business.
""If you take straight apparel as a category, it represents...no more than 16 percent of our business, including Katies,"" he said.  
""We are happy to be in that segment. We think we have a very good balance to the retail category that we sell, and we are not in the mood to make short-term decisions on cyclical events.
""When apparel gets good again, it will be very nice to own a specialty apparel business,"" Eck said.  
Weak apparel sales were offset in the third quarter by strong sales from the supermarket and Kmart businesses, enabling Eck to stick to his forecast of steady second-half profits.
""We...(had) stated that we expected a similar percentage growth in the second-half profit after tax to that experienced in the first half, excluding property disposal profits and abnormals,"" Eck said in a statement.
""We are still of that view, subject to conditions remaining stable.""  
Analysts are forecasting Coles to report, on average, a net profit before abnormals of A$326.7 million for the year to July 27, according to an April survey by Barceps forecasting service.
Coles reported a pre-abnormal net profit of A$302 million in 1995/96.

MarkBendeich,"Two big U.S. power companies said on Monday they would continue investing billions of dollars in Asian energy assets to help drive profits at home.
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp and Minnesota-based NRG Energy Inc, which last month combined to buy control of Australia's richest power station and coal mine, said they were eyeing other major investments in Australia and Southeast Asia.
""Both companies here are very active in the Asian region,"" said David Weaver, of CMS Asia, after settling the A$4.75-billion (US$3.7-billion) Australian purchase.
""This is not the first pot shot at a project. This is part of a very clear strategy of building a business across the region, not just picking up the odd project...""
Weaver and the U.S.-based chiefs of CMS and NRG were in Melbourne to present the Victoria state government a cheque for the Loy Yang A power station and coal mine.
The sale of the 2,000-megawatt plant, the most efficient in Australia, stands as the nation's single biggest privatisation.
CMS, which took 50 percent of Loy Yang, and NRG, which took 25 percent, said on Monday they would be natural partners for other major investments in Australia or elsewhere in the region.  
""There will be, before too long, another large project where we would work together, whether that be here or in Southeast Asia,"" said NRG's Asia-Pacific chief, David Scaysbrook.
""Both companies are actively interested in pursuing privatisations...,"" he told a joint media briefing.
He cited Indonesia, saying it was looking to sell a part or all of its electricity generating system, as well as possible sales of state-owned assets in the Philippines and Thailand.
CMS aims to build its offshore asset base to 40 percent of the group, with Southeast Asia the likely home for most of this capital, said CMS chief operating officer Vic Fryling.
CMS now has 20 percent of its US$9 billion asset base in offshore investments and is active in 10 Asian countries.
It runs India's only independent power station, a gas-fired plant in Andhra Pradesh state. It also runs three plants in the Philippines and is developing a gas business there, Weaver said.
""We are looking at the commercial nuclear plants in the Philippines,"" he added.
CMS is an integrated energy company that spreads its investment from gas exploration to electricity generation. NRG focuses mainly on electricity generation.  
NRG is soon to close a deal on building and operating a joint venture coal-fired power station in West Java, Indonesia.
The deal, to be closed in four to six weeks, will be followed by ""our second deal in Asia in the next few months"", said NRG's Scaysbrook. He said the investment involved gas-fired power generation but declined to say more.
NRG's parent, Northern States Power Co, is dependent on NRG for earnings growth and, in turn, NRG is looking to Asia to help deliver, said NRG chief executive David Paterson.
""We (NRG) have committed to them (NSP) that we will provide 20 percent of their earnings by the year 2000, and we are a little bit less than half of that at the moment,"" Paterson said.

MarkBendeich,"Australian paper and packaging giant Amcor Ltd, continuing a run of depressing profit results and forecasts, said on Tuesday that it hoped the worst would be over in 1996/97 (July/June).  
Amcor managing director Don Macfarlane said full-year net profit would be lower than the A$338.8 million achieved in 1995/96 but he saw paper prices rising from early calendar 1998.
""If you read the things we have said since the half-year (profit announcement) you would have to come to that conclusion,"" Macfarlane told Reuters.
""Hopefully this is the worst of it,"" he added.
His comments followed a statement in which Amcor said second half results would be lower than a year-ago and than the 1996/97 first half. There would also be some significant write-downs.
"
MarkBendeich,"Australia's top bank, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), is expected to report half-year net earnings of over A$1 billion (US$780 million) on Thursday, putting it on track for another record full-year result.
Banking analysts contacted by Reuters have forecast NAB to report a net profit of A$1.13 billion to A$1.17 billion for the half-year to March 31, a rise of up to 17 percent on a year ago.
Such a result would dwarf the interim earnings of NAB's major rivals, with Westpac Banking Corp forecast to report on Wednesday a net profit of up to A$620 million.
The only other major bank with an end-September balance date, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, reports its interim earnings on May 22, with one Melbourne analyst tipping a half-year net profit of A$630 million.
A half-year result of upwards of A$1.1 billion would put NAB on course for an annual net profit of up to A$2.47 billion for 1996/97, surpassing last year's record A$2.102 billion, according to analysts' forecasts.
NAB's strong profit growth comes despite shrinking lending margins and hot competition for home mortgages in Australia.
While Commonwealth Bank of Australia has sacrificed margins to build market share, and an acquisitive Westpac has gone shopping for asset growth, NAB has used marketing to boost its share of home loan assets, analysts said.
NAB's offshore assets -- four banks in Britain, Northern Ireland and Ireland, as well as Michigan National Bank and Bank of New Zealand -- have also lessened its overall exposure to Australia's weak housing sector, a Melbourne analyst said.
""They are also very aggressive on costs,"" the analyst said.
NAB, the most efficient of the big banks, aims to lower its cost-to-income ratio to 40 percent by year 2000 from 53 percent.
NAB is also likely to buck the trend on charges for bad debts in its interim result, the Melbourne analyst said.
""For NAB, we have them going down still. I think that's due primarily to some write-backs,"" he said. But he predicted worsening bad debts across the banking sector in the near-term.
Increased fee income is likely to cushion the major banks against further margin squeeze, said Colonial Investment Management's senior investment manager, Martin Hickling.
NAB is also cutting costs offshore, he added.
""They have been earning sub-normal levels of returns over the last couple of years and they have been doing work in terms of improving those returns,"" Hickling told Reuters.
NAB, ranked Australia's top bank on Monday in a survey by accountants KPMG, is also seen as the most likely to gobble up one of the other majors.
But the government has ordered a freeze on big bank mergers until it sees competition for banking services heat up further.
"
MarkBendeich,"Australia's biggest bank, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), said on Thursday it would consider any opportunity to merge with a local life office.
Managing director Don Argus told Reuters that NAB remained an acquisitive bank, even though its hands were tied on mergers with other major domestic rivals by government policy.
""That's an option, yes, because we have a liability driven strategy,"" he said when asked if NAB would consider merging with a domestic life office or forming an alliance with one.
NAB has placed heavy emphasis on asset growth, but it is now trying hard to grow the deposit side of its business. Life offices manage major pools of deposited funds.
NAB recently made a failed bid for the New South Wales state government's Axiom funds management arm, which has A$18 billion of funds under management. Axiom was sold for A$240 million to London-based funds group Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
""We have been an acquisitive bank for something like 10 years and our strategy is well known -- it's opportunity and price,"" Argus said.
Australia's life offices have begun to compete with banks in lending, in line with the global convergence of financial service industries.
Under revised government policy announced in April, the nation's two major life offices, the Australian Mutual Provident Society and National Mutual Holdings Ltd, are allowed to merge with any of the major banks.
National Mutual is controlled by French insurer Axa SA
Other major life offices are Colonial Ltd, which lists on the Australian Stock Exchange next week, and Mercantile Mutual, a unit of ING Group NV.
Earlier on Thursday, NAB announced a 14.1 percent jump in half year net profit to A$1.14 billion but said it faced increasing competitive pressures. Even so, Argus said NAB hoped to achieve at least match this record result in the second half.
Argus was also critical of government policy on financial sector reform, saying delays in finalising the new rules were making the local big banks takeover targets for foreign competitors.
NAB, which has profitable bank operations in the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand, was a keen supporter of allowing big bank mergers in its submission to the Wallis inquiry into the financial system.
In its response to the Wallis report, the national government said on April 9 that it would not allow mergers among the big four banks at the moment but would permit them to merge with major life offices and would also permit takeovers by foreign banks.
NAB, the largest and most profitable of Australia's private banks with an asset base of nearly A$190 billion, ended Thursday trade with a market capitalisation of A$27.1 billion.
It overshadows the other three banks, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd which are valued at between A$12.6 billion and A$13.7 billion.

"
MarkBendeich,"Australia's biggest bank, National Australia Bank, on Thursday reported record half-year net earnings but said it felt vulnerable to foreign takeover.
Unveiling a A$1.14 billion (US$885 million) profit for the six months ended March 31, managing director Don Argus suggested a government freeze on mergers between the four big local banks had exposed all of them to the threat of foreign takeover.
He said NAB felt vulnerable.
""I certainly do, particularly when some of our friendly merchant banks from the Northern Hemisphere tell you that you're at the top of the 'Hit Parade',"" Argus told reporters.
The most profitable of Australia's banks and ranked its top bank by KPMG management consultancy, NAB has been seen as a likely predator if big bank mergers in Australia are approved.
But the freeze remains despite an official inquiry into the Australian financial system recommending last month that the big banks as well as major life offices be allowed to merge.
The government wants the ban on big-bank mergers to stay until competition widens and intensifies. But it has opened the way for a foreign bank to swoop on one of the big four.
Argus on Thursday criticised the government's position, warning competition was unrelenting and would put the group's ability to deliver further record profits under pressure.
The warning sparked sell orders on NAB shares, which ended at $A18.11 on Thursday, down 23 cents on Wednesday's close but still at historical highs.
Offshore income bolstered NAB's performance, with earnings growth from its six bank subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and New Zealand.
Even Asia, a small part of NAB's international business, has begun to ""put its head up now with some decent black figures"", Argus said. Net profit from the Asian business more than doubled to A$15 million from A$6 million a year ago.
Offshore income now accounts for 37 percent of NAB's net earnings. This offers the bank some protection from Australia's fragile housing market and will ensure it continues to outperform its domestic rivals, banking analysts said.
""All the banks are doing it very tough in Australia at the moment,"" a Melbourne-based analyst said.
Argus said NAB would start to feel the pinch of lower interest rates in the curent half-year, ending September 30, but felt the bank could match last year's second-half result.
""We would like to think we could,"" he said.
If so, NAB would achieve a record annual net profit of about A$2.24 billion, just under state-owned telecommunication carrier Telstra's Australian record profit of A$2.3 billion in 1995/96 (July/June). (A$1 = US$0.7760)

MarkBendeich,"French insurance giant Axa-UAP is to be awarded a coveted licence to sell life insurance to China's emerging middle classes, the group's Asian subsidiary said on Friday.
Australian-based National Mutual Holdings Ltd, owned 51 percent by Axa-UAP, said Chinese authorities had advised its parent verbally that a licence would be granted.
The announcement, which confirmed a Reuter report from Shanghai on Tuesday, sent the shares of National Mutual to a record high on the expectation it would run the China business.
Shares in National Mutual Asia Ltd, the Hong Kong-listed Asian business arm of National Mutual, were also firmer.
""Obviously it's good that the greater Axa group of companies has secured a licence to operate in China,"" National Mutual Holdings managing director Geoff Tomlinson told Reuters.
But he cautioned investors in National Mutual not to get ""too excited"" about the announcement, saying it was not clear if the National Mutual group would play any role in Axa's success.
The licence itself could still be 18 months away, he added.
""Until we understand the conditions that apply to the granting of this licence, it is impossible to state what role National Mutual Holdings or National Mutual Asia may play in the development of the business,"" Tomlinson said.
As well, one Sydney insurance analyst said, there was a risk National Mutual had angered Chinese authorities by confirming they intended to grant the parent company a licence.
""They were with (German insurer) Allianz and they withdrew the licence and that's a possibility (with Axa-UAP) as well,"" Macquarie Equities analyst Tony Jackson told Reuters.
China told Allianz AG Holding in November it would be granted a licence, but the licence was thrown in doubt after European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan broke the news.
Allianz has since been awarded the licence and will soon join only a handful of foreign life insurers operating in China.
China's insurance market, still in its infancy, was once almost monopolised by the state-owned People's Insurance Group, but it has gradually opened up to local and foreign competition.
National Mutual hopes its 69 percent-owned National Mutual Asia subsidiary will own the China business, in a joint venture with local partner China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd.
But Axa-UAP shareholders are unlikely to hand ownership of such a potentially lucrative business to a subsidiary, Macquarie Equities' Jackson said.
""It would be just a gift to minority interests,"" he said.
Axa-UAP shareholders have only an effective 28 percent interest in National Mutual Asia, and would prefer the Hong Kong company managed the China business for a fee, he added.
National Mutual shares hit a record high of A$2.10 after the announcement, but then fell back to end at A$1.98, up four cents on Thursday's close.

MarkBendeich,"Australian banking and insurance group Colonial Ltd hopes to make a strong share-market debut on Monday after major investors rushed its A$690 million (US$535 million) float.
On the eve of its listing on the Australian and New Zealand exchanges, Colonial announced it had priced the share offer at A$3.10 per share for institutional investors, well above the shares' net asset backing of A$2.48 each.
Colonial had given an ""indicative range"" of between A$2.50 and A$2.90 as a guide to institutions, but on Sunday it said the limited number of shares on offer drew bids well above that.
Institutional bids closed on Friday.
Of the total 235 million shares on offer, institutions could bid for only two-thirds, ensuring they paid a handsome premium to the price paid by retail investors in the first stage of the offer.
Colonial sold shares to members of the public for a fixed price of A$2.60 each this month. Each share, for both retail and institutional shareholders, comes with an option to buy more.
""We are delighted...,"" Colonial managing director Peter Smedley told a news conference in Melbourne.
""One would hope for a premium over the institutional price (on listing),"" he added.
Colonial becomes only the second life office to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, after one of its bigger rivals, National Mutual Holdings Ltd, listed last October.
Australia's biggest, the Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP), will soon follow. It plans to shed its old mutual structure and list in Australia and New Zealand next year.
Colonial has total assets of A$29.7 billion and is the only local life office with a bank, Sydney-based Colonial State Bank.
It will list with a register of over 500,000 shareholders, including its former Asian insurance partner, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd, which has secured a major stake.
Colonial will use some of the proceeds of the float to fund its recent decision to buy out Jardine's half interest in their Asian business for US$163 million.
Colonial has, like National Mutual, focused on Asia to grow its business.
It has applied for a licence to sell life insurance in China and has operations across Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Its traditional offshore markets are Britain, New Zealand and Fiji.
Colonial's Smedley indicated on Sunday the company had tried to weed out the stags from the long-term investors in the float.
He said Colonial had tried to identify investors ""perceived to be long term"" when allocating shares to institutions.

MarkBendeich,"Australian financial services group Colonial Ltd made a strong debut on the Australian share market on Monday, its share price soaring on listing.
Colonial shares closed at A$3.31 (US$2.56), well above the A$3.10 paid by institutional investors in the company's public share offer, which closed last Friday.
The market price eclipsed the A$2.60 paid by members of the public in the A$690 million float, but those who took their stag profits and ran on Monday failed to dent the price.
The closing price, just four cents off the day's high, gives the company a market capitalisation of A$1.9 billion and puts it in the top 50 Australian companies. A whopping 32.3 million shares traded hands during the day
""We are obviously delighted that we have come on with a premium. It's a strong market response,"" Colonial managing director Peter Smedley said after watching the opening share price flash up on the stock exchange boards in Melbourne.

Australia's biggest, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, will soon follow. It plans to shed its old mutual structure and list in Australia and New Zealand next year.
Smedley said he did not feel the share offer had been priced too low. ""I think the end result is a reflection of the fact we have set the price well,"" he told reporters.
""There was very heavy over-subscription from the public and a very positive response from institutions.""
Each share issued came with an underwritten option to buy more, enabling the company to raise another A$200 million between September this year and June 1998.
Colonial also made a strong debut on Monday on the New Zealand exchange, wher it has a secondary listing.
""It's certainly been an outstanding success,"" said Melbourne-based broker Kevin Lourey, of Peake Lands Kirwan.
Colonial is devoting some of the float proceeds to development of its life insurance business in Asia.
The group is spending US$163 million to buy out its old Asian partner, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd, from their equal life insurance joint venture based in Hong Kong.
Colonial has applied for a licence to sell life insurance in China and has operations across Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.
Its traditional offshore markets are Britain, New Zealand and Fiji.
Colonial will also use A$50 million of the float proceeds to complete the 1994 purchase of the State Bank of New South Wales, now renamed Colonial State Bank.
Colonial has total assets of A$29.7 billion and has forecast a net profit before preference dividends of A$180 million for calendar 1997, a-50 percent rise on its 1996 earnings.

MarkBendeich,"Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) said on Tuesday it would probe French insurer Axa-UAP's move into China, insisting it must hand ownership of Asian businesses to its Australian subsidiary.
""The board will critically examine the matter,"" a FIRB spokesman told Reuters by telephone from Canberra.
""It's a major matter -- absolutely,"" he added.
Axa-UAP said last week Chinese authorities had given it the green light to sell life insurance in China.  
The announcement hardly mentioned Axa-UAP's 51 percent owned Australian-based subsidiary, life office National Mutual Holdings Ltd, which is the Axa group's Asian arm.
National Mutual, which had separately applied for a licence to operate in China, has said it is not clear what role, ""if any"", the Australian company will play in Axa's China business.
When Axa bought 51 percent of National Mutual in 1995, the Australian government agreed to the foreign investment on the condition the parent make National Mutual its Asian arm.  
The government's FIRB approved the foreign investment provided Axa ""transferred its existing life insurance interests to National Mututal Holdings"" and pursue ""its Asia Pacific life insurance business strategy through that company"".
Insurance analysts have speculated Axa would retain ownership of the potentially lucrative China business, but would pay National Mutual's 69-percent subsidiary, Hong Kong-based National Mutual Asia, to manage it.
But the FIRB spokesman said the board, in approving Axa's investment in National Mutual, cleary intended for Axa to hand ownership of its Asian businesses to the Australian company.  
""It means ownership,"" the spokesman said.
FIRB will seek dialogue with both Axa and National Mutual in order to examine how the China business will be run, he said.
Ultimately, if the conditions of Axa's investment in National Mutual were found to be breached, the government could move to enforce those conditions, he added.
""There are powers under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act which enable the government to enforce compliance with the conditions of approval,"" he said.
""There are penalties available...,"" he added. He declined to comment further.  
In an earlier case, the Australian government ruled that Canadian company CanWest Global Communication Corp  CCSs.TO had to reduce its stake in the Ten Group Ltd because it was inconsistent with the government's foreign investment policy.

MarkBendeich,"Australia's central bank is out to make a buck -- preferably a foreign one.
The conservative, pin-striped officials of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) are quietly but aggressively building up a business in printing foreign currency.
Deep inside a heavily guarded concrete fortress on the outskirts of Melbourne, the RBA's printing presses are already turning out as many foreign banknotes as Australian notes.
Thai baht, Singapore dollars, Indonesian rupiah and Kuwaiti dinars have all rolled off the bank's presses under printing deals with offshore central banks.
Like the new generation of Australian banknotes, the foreign banknotes are all made of plastic using patented technology promoted world-wide by the RBA as the scourge of counterfeiters.
""The RBA is very keen to see this technology adopted internationally,"" said Robert Larkin, chief executive of the RBA's printing division, Note Printing Australia.
Plastic banknotes of the type made by the RBA, which each feature a small transparent ""window"" to foil counterfeiters, last much longer in circulation than paper banknotes. A paper note can be in tatters in months; plastic can last four years.
PLASTIC REIGNS
Now that all Australian notes are printed on polymer, not paper, the RBA does not need to print nearly as many banknotes. Its printing presses were becoming idle.
About 600 million local banknotes rolled off the RBA's presses each year before the switch to plastic notes from 1988. Now they churn out only 150 million Australian banknotes a year.
""We are victims of our own success, but at the same time we have liberated capacity for export opportunities,"" the printing division's sales manager, Michael Beedle, told Reuters.
So the bank is globe-trotting for new business, trying to convince other central banks to go plastic.
""Significant numbers of countries have done or are currently undertaking trials (on the plastic notes) virtually around the world,"" the RBA's Larkin said. Printing presses do not need any modification to cope with the plastic notes, he said.
Within three years, the RBA hopes that 75 percent of the banknotes rattling off its Melbourne presses will be for export.
But competition for the export dollar -- or lira, rupee or whatever currency is up for grabs -- is cut-throat.
Canadian commercial printers Dura Note and Domtar Inc also make plastic banknotes, while the world's few commercial paper banknote printers fiercely guard their turf, Larkin said.
""The industry is reluctant to move away from a 300-year-old technology and there's strong resistance from printers to put plastic through the printing press,"" the RBA's Beedle said.
MONEY-MAKING JOINT VENTURE
The RBA is not only targetting central banks that do not print their own banknotes. For central banks with their own presses, it wants to sell them the blank polymer notes on which they can print their own designs.
The RBA and British-based UCB Films Plc, a unit of Belgian chemicals and drugs group UCB, have formed a A$1.5 million (US$1.16 million) equal joint venture, Securency, to market the blank notes. RBA and UCB will split the profits.
Securency is ambitious and is eyeing two of the most prized of all banknote printing jobs -- the new Euro scheduled to come into circulation from 2002, as well as the greenback.
""The two biggest markets to go for other than China and India would be the U.S. one-dollar bill and the Euro. That's what we have set our targets on,"" Securency general manager Myles Curtis told Reuters in Melbourne.
But Securency has foresaken any hope of persuading European monetary authorities to make their first Euro a plastic one.
""We probably missed the boat first time around because they are already starting to consider the manufacture of the note, but they will have to look at the next generation,"" Curtis said.
The greenback is also a tantalising prospect, after an attempt to replace the U.S. one-dollar note with a new coin met a hostile public reaction.
""The US$1 note represents 50 percent of their manufacturing capability,"" he said, adding that a polymer note would allow the Federal Reserve to stay with a note but slash printing costs.
HOT MONEY
Though polymer banknotes are considered rugged enough for the Australian public, they are feeling the heat in Europe.
A man writing from Bratislava has told The Economist magazine how he accidentally tumbled-dried an Australian note in the pocket a pair of jeans.
""The banknote I left in my jeans emerged shrunken and distorted,"" he wrote.
Undaunted, Securency believes plastic money will eventually find its way into wallets around the world.
There is also an environmental spin-off. In Australia, worn-out banknotes are shredded and recycled to make, among other things -- plastic garbage bins and flower pots.

MarkBendeich,"The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, said on Wednesday it needed to polish its public image after it came under attack for the second time in as many weeks.
A fortnight after protesters swarmed on the group's London annual meeting, Australian trade unionists and conservationists infiltrated a shareholders' meeting in Melbourne, criticising its record on human rights, labour and environmental issues.  
RTZ-CRA's Australian chairman, John Uhrig, and some of the protesters, speaking as Australian shareholders or their proxy, engaged at times in shouting matches inside the meeting hall.
Trade unionists from Australia's coal and iron ore industries accused RTZ-CRA of intimidating workers, while others claimed it refused to stand up against human rights abuses.
Uhrig strongly denied the accusations and appeared to feel protesters were hijacking the meeting, insisting other shareholders be allowed to speak.
He finally called on a vote to have the meeting closed.  
But later, speaking to reporters, he said work needed to be done to improve the group's public image. ""In the general community, I am sure we have a job to do,"" Uhrig said.
The company needs to do more work in Australia to improve its public image than probably elsewhere in the world, because the group enjoys such a high profile here, he added.
He referred in particular to RTZ-CRA's labour relations.
""The general public really does not understand what we have done and maybe that needs to be explained,"" Uhrig said.

MarkBendeich,"Australia's powerful Maritime Union launched rolling bans on Indonesian shipping on Wednesday to protest against the arrest of Indonesian labour leaders and Canberra's ""failure"" to press Jakarta on human rights.
The lightning bans, called at short notice and designed to hold up ships for 24 hours, could apply on an irregular basis to all types of commodity exports to Indonesia, the union said.
Jakarta said the union's move could hurt bilateral ties.
""Such kind of incidents are regretted and will harm the efforts to build up relations between the two countries,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl said in Jakarta.
""Probably this kind of thing will have the strongest reaction from the business sector who are most affected,"" Fadyl told Reuters. He declined to comment further.
Indonesia, Australia's nearest Asian neighbour, bought A$2.4 billion (US$1.9 billion) worth of Australian commodities in 1995, covering grains, minerals, livestock and refined petroleum.
""The bans are to protest against the recent arrests of independent labour leaders Muchtar Pakpahan and Dita Sari and the continuing repression following the July riots in Jakarta,"" the union said in a statement.
The bans were also a response to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's failure in Jakarta this week to press Indonesia on the issue of human rights and democracy, the union said.
During his visit to Indonesia, Howard reaffirmed Australia's commitment to close ties.
The first ship to be hit by the rolling bans will be the Bogasari Empat, due to arrive in Fremantle on Australia's west coast late on Wednesday to load 32,500 tonnes of wheat.
The ship will load wheat as scheduled but will be delayed for 24 hours before being able to depart, union assistant secretary Vic Slater told Reuters.
""It delays things,"" Slater said of the bans. ""In terms of the economy, I don't think it has any effect on the Australian economy.""
Pakpahan, leader of the Indonesian Labour Welfare Union (SBSI), has been charged with subversion in connection with riots that rocked the Indonesian capital on July 27. The crime of subversion is punishable by death.
Five people died and 149 were injured in the Jakarta riots, Indonesia's official Human Rights Commission has said. Scores of buildings were set ablaze in the unrest, which was the worst in Jakarta since anti-Japanese riots there in 1974.
The riots followed a police raid on the headquarters of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to evict supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, who had been ousted as party leader by a government-backed faction the previous month.
Labour activist Dita Sari was arrested before the July 27 riots over a labour strike in Surabaya, media reports have said.
The Australian rolling bans are in line with a world-wide campaign against Pakpahan's arrest by the International Transport Workers' Federation, which represents more than five million workers in 120 countries, the Maritime Union said.
""Muchtar Pakpahan is an independent and moderate union leader who has even won the respect of the U.S. embassy (in Jakarta),"" Slater said.
U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord met Pakpahan in his Jakarta cell last Friday.
The Maritime Union has 10,000 members working around Australia as seamen and waterside workers.

MarkBendeich,"An Australian biotechnology firm has registered what it claims to be a unique vaccine against the world-wide problem of salmonella poisoning in chickens and hopes to register the vaccine for cattle as well.
The vaccine, registered with Australia's National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Vetinerary Chemicals, is the only salmonella vaccine able to be used on chicken eggs, Bioproperties Australia Pty Ltd said on Wednesday.  
""There's no vaccine in the world that can do that presently,"" said managing director David Tinworth, who estimated total annual sales of ""tens of millions of dollars"" if the vaccine was able to be sold internationally.
""We can actually inject this vaccine into the egg before it hatches because most of the salmonella spread into the poulty industry are in the hatcher,"" he told Reuters.
Bioproperties has successfully trialled the genetically manipulated vaccine in both chickens and cattle, the national government's Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, which oversaw the trials, confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday.  
The company has also applied to register the vaccine domestically for use in cattle, Tinworth told Reuters. ""The registration is in process,"" he added.
Vaccine sales into the poultry industry will begin at the end of this year, and Bioproperties plans to begin sales into local dairy and cattle industries within 18 months, he said.
""We are seeking registration in the whole of Europe (through the European Community) and the U.S.,"" Tinworth said.
To develop the vaccine, Bioproperties secured a sub-licence on a patent registered in the United States for a technique known as gene depletion, he said.  
Bioproperties sub-contracted the vaccine research work to the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, which used the patented gene-depletion technique to develop a benign salmonella bacterium which stimulated the immune system.
Unlike existing salmonella vaccines, the gene-depleted vaccine carries no risk of inducing salmonella infection, Tinworth said. ""This vaccine is totally safe in the sense that it cannot cause salmonelosis,"" he added.
Bioproperties will pay royalties on sales to both the U.S. patent-holder Praxis and the institute.  
It is now working with Wyeth Australia Ltd, a unit of U.S. pharmaceutical group American Home Products Corp, to register a salmonella vaccine for humans, Tinworth said.
Such a vaccine would be well suited for use on immuno-supressed people such as AIDS sufferers, he added.
However, the company's initial market will be the huge poultry market, which slaughters an estimated 22 billion broilers each year, Tinworth said, adding the vaccine would be priced below current poultry vaccines at one U.S. cent per dose.

MarkBendeich,"Australia's Trust Bank said on Friday a locally listed insurer and two offshore institutions had expressed interest in buying a 49 percent stake in the bank.
Trust Bank managing director Paul Kemp declined to name the three groups but said such an early response to the bank's quest for a long-term strategic partner was a good sign.
""We have had three expressions that are potentially worth listening to,"" Kemp told Reuters.  
They were from a local insurer, an unlisted offshore insurer and another offshore financial instution, thought to be a bank, which approached the Trust Bank through an intermediary.
Tasmania-based Trust Bank announced in March that it was looking for a strategic partner to take a 49 percent stake, hopefully by early 1998.
The bank then plans to issue 41 percent of its equity to the public by the end of 1998 and embark on national expansion.
Trust Bank is effectively owned by a community trust and, like mutual societies, has no shareholders.  
It has net assets of A$143 million, implying a total value of A$257 million, based on the goodwill paid in the sale of another regional Australian bank, BankWest Ltd, in 1995.
One insurance analyst said the most likely local insurer to have expressed an interest in taking a stake in Trust Bank was Sydney-based GIO Australia Holdings Ltd.
National Mutual Holdings Ltd has ruled out any interest in acquiring a banking licence, saying it is no longer worth paying a premium due to convergence in the industry.
Colonial Ltd already owns a bank.  
The analyst said it was unlikely any of the other seven listed insurers would be interested.
""I imagine it's probably GIO, but it doesn't sound to me like it would be a big issue whether it got it or not,"" the Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters.
The value of a bank to an insurer would be the bank's distribution network, the analyst said.
But Trust Bank's branch network is confined mainly to Tasmania state, its home market.
It has just four branches outside Tasmania.  
Trust Bank's Kemp said the bank would soon choose a big global accountancy firm to help it identify a partner. It is also drafting an information memorandum for potential partners.
Kemp insisted a banking licence was still a valuable asset for non-bank institutions. ""You are going to get an immediate foothold in the Australian market place,"" he said.
""You are going to acquire a franchise which has considerable value, you are going to get a distribution network. You are going to hire a level of expertise,"" he said.  
Trust Bank has ruled out any of the other local banks as a strategic partner, saying none of them would be interested in fulfilling Trust bank's broader ambitions.

MarkBendeich,"Shell Australia Ltd said it wants to integrate the huge North West Shelf and Gorgon gas projects off northwest Australia and that talks with its partners would soon enter a ""constructive"" phase.
Shell, a part owner in each project, dismissed as absurd the option of developing Gorgon as a stand-alone project with its own greenfield liquified natural gas (LNG) plant, and said it was working to jointly develop Gorgon and the North West Shelf.  
""It's been our contrivance for the last year to bring it (Gorgon) in,"" Shell Australia chief executive Roland Williams told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday night.
""I believe we can look for quite constructive discussions on this now."" Williams did not give a timetable for a decision.
""Everybody wants to do the right thing. We have got to try and understand each other,"" he said.
Shell owns a sixth of the North West Shelf project, which has a total production capacity of 7.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) through its LNG plant on the Burrup Pensinsula.  
The other partners are The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, the MiMi consortium, Chevron Corp, British Petroleum Co and Woodside Petroleum.
Shell also owns two-sevenths of the nearby Gorgon gas field, which has the capacity to produce 6 MTPA but is still subject to feasibility studies. The other partners are Chevron, Texaco Inc and Mobil Corp unit Ampolex Ltd.
Shell and other main players in the two projects are under pressure from the Western Australia state government to decide soon on the future development of the state's LNG industry.  
""There's no question we must expand,"" Williams said, adding that he and the visiting chairman of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group's committee of managing directors, Cor Herkstroter, spoke to Western Australia premier Richard Court in Perth this week.
""The Japanese market want that capacity and we have a wonderful position there, so Shell is absolutely 110 percent behind the need to expand capacity in Western Australia,"" he said. But, Williams added, ""It is frankly absurd in building another LNG plant on the north sea front of Western Australia.""  
""Our attitude to Gorgon is very straight forward. For God's sake don't go and waste the money building another grass-roots plant in Western Australia. We've got one of the best in the world at the Burrup Pensinsula,"" he said.
""You can pipe all the gas in there.""
Japanese gas and power utilities take the bulk of North West Shelf LNG and have agreed to buy an additional 6.8 MTPA from next decade, paving the way for a A$5 billion expansion of the North West Shelf project to double capacity at the Burrup plant.
The extra capacity would start to come on stream in 2003 and reach around 14.7 mtpa two years later, Williams said.  
The North West Shelf and Gorgon partners should optimise the resources, developing the lowest-cost reserves first, he said.
""On the Burrup Pensinsula we have world's nicest LNG plant and offshore we have wave after wave of gas. We can produce gas from there I think till the end of the next century.
""What you do is to optimise your up-front economics,"" Williams said. ""You take obviously the cheapest gas to liquify earliest, because if you are going to put in A$5 billion into an investment, you are looking for the best cash flow in the first year of operation. Gorgon will go into there, and we are very happy to cooperate on that....""  
The MiMi partner in the North West Shelf project is a 50-50 joint venture between Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp.

MarkBendeich,"A new diamond mine looks likely to go ahead in north Australia after one of its backers on Thursday described a final feasiblity study on the project as ""encouraging"".
Base metals miner Aberfoyle Ltd, which has a minority interest alongside diamond group Ashton Mining Ltd in the Merlin project in the Northern Territory, said the study was now virtually complete.
""I think both companies have previously said they expected this to be developed into a project, albeit not at a large scale initially,"" Aberfoyle managing director Mike Eager told Reuters.
""I think it's probably on track for that sort of conclusion,"" Eager said.
The feasibility study, prepared by engineering consultants Bateman-Kinhill, has been discussed by the two owners and could be decided upon as early as this month.
The report is due before Ashton's board on June 19.
Aberfoyle said both companies would make a final decision by the end of the September quarter.
Ashton owns 77.5 percent of Merlin. Aberfoyle has the rest.
The feasibility study assumes a modest start to mining, with stage one annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes of ore. Ashton has already said the first stage would cost about A$20 million (US$15.2 million).
The joint venture partners plan to develop some open pits before evaluating Merlin's underground mining resource and proceeding to a stage two expansion.
""We are still encouraged by what we have seen by the further work on site and the further (work on the) feasibility study and certainly there is no reason for discouragement,"" Eager said.
The Merlin prospect contains about 12 kimberlite pipes -- rock formations associated with diamonds -- and only three of them have been bulk sampled for diamonds so far, he said.
The sampling results suggest further upside to the project, Eager added.
""There's evidence in at least some of the pipes that there's an improvement in stone quality and perhaps in grade ... at the perimeters of the pipes,"" he said.
Ashton reported late last year that diamonds recovered from Merlin were described as being 35 percent gem quality, with the remainder near gem quality.
In its March quarter production report, Ashton said the results of recent cutting and polishing tests on 25 Merlin diamonds had been ""very encouraging"".
Ashton, which is owned 46.95 percent by Malaysia Mining Corp Bhd, owns 40.1 percent of the world's biggest diamond mine, the Argyle mine in northwest Australia.

MartinWolk,"Walt Disney Co.'s agreement to buy into billionaire Paul Allen's Starwave Corp. will mean little change for the online company's 300 employees, Chief Executive Officer Mike Slade said Thursday.
In an interview, Slade said Starwave would continue producing its nine Internet sites including the hugely popular ESPNet SportZone as well as a new ABC News site that will go online this month.
He said the long-expected announcement by Disney represented a natural evolution for Starwave, which has become one of the Internet's early success stories by focusing on sports and entertainment and teaming with well-known ""brand names.""
""What's really important is the big traditional media company and the Internet company get their strategic and economic interests completely aligned, and they are,"" Slade said. ""These relationships are always complicated, but everyone's working for the exact same goal.""
Disney and Starwave did not provide financial details, but Slade said the deal reduces Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp., to a minority shareholder with a single representative on Starwave's new board, which will be controlled by Disney.
Analysts said Disney paid about $100 million for a one-third stake, with a series of options to buy the rest over the next five years. Starwave employees also own shares.
Starwave was founded by Allen and Slade in 1993, before the Internet emerged as a commercial publishing platform. The company explored interactive television before developing content for proprietary online services and CD-ROMs.
""Then the Web came along,"" said Slade, who credited the company's chief technology officer Patrick Naughton and Progressive Networks founder Rob Glaser with persuading him to adopt an Internet business plan.
Starwave launched its sports product in late 1994 and signed the deal with ESPN -- now mostly owned by Disney -- the following spring.
The ESPNet site is considered one of the Web's most popular and one of the few mainstream areas that charge for access.
While basic sports results and information are free of charge, Slade said about 100,000 people pay to play in fantasy leagues or gain access to premium information at $4.95 a month.
Starwave also operates Mr. Showbiz, a well-regarded entertainment site, as well as a site for parents and children and official sites for professional football, basketball and auto racing.
Slade said Starwave's experience producing ESPNet would help in creating innovative features for the ABC News site.
Despite competition with virtually every major news organization including CNN, USA Today and NBC's joint venture with Microsoft, Slade was optimistic Disney could make money in news.
""One of the things about Disney that makes them the ideal partner is they never do things in a lackadaisical way,"" Slade said. ""They marshal all the corporate resources and really make it happen.""

MartinWolk,"A huge cheer erupted in the newsroom of the Seattle Times shortly after 12 noon Monday when Washington state's largest newspaper learned it had won its sixth Pulitzer prize.
A few minutes later another cheer went up when the newspaper won its seventh.
""It was wild pandemonium,"" said business editor Rob Weisman.
For any but the nation's largest newspapers it is virtually unheard of to win more than one Pulitzer in a year, but the Seattle Times this year won in two prestigious categories  -- investigative reporting and beat reporting.
""We had two very competitive candidates, but the odds against winning two in a single year are so astronomical there's simply no way you can get your hopes up for something like that,"" said executive editor Mike Fancher.
With a daily circulation of 235,000, the Seattle Times barely ranks among the nation's 50 biggest newspapers.
The Pulitzer judges cited the Times for its series exploring corruption in a federally subsidised housing programme for native Americans and for beat reporter Byron Acohido's investigation of rudder control problems on the Boeing 737, the world's most widely used airplane.
Shortly after the series was published the Federal Aviation Administration called for inspection of all U.S.-based models for any possible jamming of rudder parts, and Boeing announced it was working on a modification.
Throughout his investigation, Acohido encountered what Fancher called a ""very hostile reaction"" from Boeing, the region's dominant employer.
At one point the company issued a statement saying it refused to cooperate with Acohido because ""we have lost all confidence that he is capable of objective reporting when it comes to Boeing.""
""In terms of access to Boeing they've treated me consistently, which means minimum access,"" Acohido said. ""There are other ways of getting information.""
The Pulitzer was the second for Times reporter Eric Nalder, who was part of the investigative team that also included Deborah Nelson and Alex Tizon.
Their report on inequities in subsidised Indian housing led to congressional hearings and proposals to change the law governing the programme.
""In both stories the immediate aftermath was that things changed, and that's what good journalism is about,"" Fancher said.
Nalder also was part of the team that won the newspaper's last Pulitzer in 1990 for its coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.

MartinWolk,"Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., and Compaq Computer Corp.  Monday proposed standards for a new generation of televisions that would be compatible with an emerging class of personal computers for the home.
In a telephone briefing with reporters, Microsoft Senior Vice President Craig Mundie said the proposed television protocol -- unveiled at a broadcasters' conference in Las Vegas -- also would be recommended as a standard for multimedia PCs to be detailed at a major industry meeting in San Francisco this week.
Mundie said the companies, dubbed the ""Big Three"" of the personal computer industry, are proposing adoption of three out of 18 advanced technical standards set forth by a television industry coalition.
Mundie and executives from Intel and Compaq said their proposal would allow a ""significant improvement"" in picture quality as well as transmission of related information and data to personal computers, television and hybrid devices.
""This model of television in particular is going to provide the viewer with a completely different experience,"" said Robert Stearns, senior vice president of Compaq.
He suggested that advanced television, also known as high-definition television, would allow viewers greater opportunity to interact with programming by choosing camera angles, chatting with characters, responding to advertising and even affecting the outcome of shows.
He said that beyond the issues of ""plumbing"" or technical standards, the broadcast industry could develop new revenue streams from advanced television.
He and the other executives said equipping personal computers to decode and display the new forms of television signals would add very little to the cost of the devices, perhaps less than $150.
At the same time, the emergence of advanced television is creating a new class of big-screen personal computers which combine features of the computer and television.
The consumer electronics industry is gearing up for production of advanced television sets with sophisticated computer circuitry.
Last week, the Federal Communications Commission, culminating a 10-year effort, called for a rollout of the technology that will have digital television on the air in the nation's 10 biggest markets within 18 months.
But rather than set specific technical standards for advanced television, the agency essentially is allowing the industry and marketplace to decide, Mundie said.
Placing a major bet on the coming convergence of computers and television, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft over the weekend agreed in a $425 million deal to buy WebTV Networks Inc., which provides a way for consumers to access the Internet on their TV screens.
Raising the ante further, Mundie said Microsft planned to include technology needed for its preferred television standards in forthcoming versions of its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems.
That would mean competing television standards would be incompatible with Windows-based computers.

MartinWolk,"Microsoft Corp. Tuesday fired the latest salvo in its battle with rival Netscape Communications Corp. as it unveiled the latest version of its Internet Explorer browser.
Version 4.0 of the Microsoft browser was posted on the Internet (http://www.microsoft.com/ie), but the company cautioned that the ""platform preview release"" was only for developers and technical evaluators.
Meanwhile Netscape this week released a third ""platform preview"" version of its competing Communicator suite of Internet products, which includes its popular Navigator browser.
Microsoft's browser will be finalized by sometime in ""midsummer,"" a company executive said, while the Netscape package will be available commercially this quarter.
""Having a browser beta that is such an early beta out in the public hands is something that would never have happened two years ago,"" said Annette Hamilton of ZDNet AnchorDesk, referring to the Microsoft preview release.
""The reason it is happening is there is so much intense competition,""she said. ""They don't want to lose momentum.""
Until last year Navigator dominated the emerging Internet market with an overwhelming market share of about 90 percent, but with the release of version 3.0 of Internet Explorer, Microsoft has come back to capture up to one third of the market.
Microsoft gives away its browser for free, and many customers pay only small licensing fees for current Navigator versions. But the market battle is crucial in Microsoft's effort to maintain its dominance of the personal computer industry by controlling the operating system.
In fact the new version of Internet Explorer can be integrated into the Windows 95 desktop and so users can ""browse"" for information either on the individual computer or out on the Internet.
The browser ultimately will be integrated into an update of the Windows 95 operating system, expected sometime next year.
Microsoft also said the new browser can be programmed to automatically check for updates to frequent Web sites and to allow for ""Webcasting"" by content providers that will be able to offer subscriptions.
""We've combined push capabilities, (computer) desktop integration and the latest in browsing and communication technologies to deliver the best of the PC and the best of the Web,"" said Brad Chase, vice president of Microsoft's applications and Internet client group.
The initial version of Internet Explorer 4.0 will be available only for Microsoft's Windows 95 platofrm, although the company also is working on versions for Windows 3.1, Macintosh and Unix, officials said.
Meanwhile Netscape's Communicator, which will cost $59 for individual licenses, will work on all platforms, said Daniel Klaussen, a group product manager for the company.
""Not much is given away in the world,"" he said, referring to Microsoft's browser. ""For its business model to work Microsoft really needs users to upgrade to their latest operating system, and of course that is not free.""
Internet Explorer 4.0 also includes Outlook Express, which gives users advanced e-mail and other capabilities; Microsoft NetMeeting, software that allows video conferencing; and Microsoft NetShow, software that enables Web publishers to offer live ""Webcasts"" as well as video and multimedia on demand by computer users.
Microsoft stock rose $2.375 to $98.25 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday, while Netscape dipped 37.5 cents to $27.625.

MartinWolk,"Boeing Co. plans to enter the airline maintenance business within the next several months as part of a drive by the jet manufacturer to develop new business opportunities, a top executive said Friday.
""It's one of the things we're looking at, and I'm quite sure we're going to do it,"" said Larry Clarkson, president of Boeing Enterprises, a new division of the company's commercial airplane group.
Clarkson said in an interview the company is negotiating with several potential partners, which he declined to identify, and might begin by forming a joint venture to provide maintenance for airlines that want to use outside contractors for the business.
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Boeing was pushing to take over the heavy-maintenance operations of several major carriers, possibly including British Airways Plc, but Clarkson said any such transaction would be a long way off.
""When it comes to, say, taking over the total maintenance of a major airline, it's going to take us a while,"" Clarkson said. ""It's a very complicated thing to do.""
A spokeswoman for British Airways declined comment.
Industry analysts said a move by Boeing into maintenance would make sense as a way to diversify the company's business beyond highly cyclical airplane manufacturing and weapons systems.
""If you can get into that business without stepping on your customer's toes I think it's a great idea,"" said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.
He and other analysts said the move was a reflection of Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit's efforts to diversify Boeing while the manufacturer is enjoying a record wave of new orders.
""This is a reflection of Phil Condit and his more aggressive nature than his predecessor and a reflection of the internal thinking that's going on as to where best could they deploy the huge amount of cash they're going to have on hand,"" said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
Boeing had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of last year, and Nisbet estimated that with the company's expected acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. this year it will generate at least $1.5 billion in excess cash annually over the next several years.
Last month Boeing Enterprises announced a $200 million joint venture with FlightSafety International to offer pilot and ground crew training. FlightSafety is a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
The Boeing unit, formed in January, also has been exploring ways to profitably use the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records.
Boeing fell $1.75 to $100.375 on the New York Stock Exchange amid a drop of 148 points, or more than 2 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average.

MartinWolk,"Boeing Co. may take over maintenance operations for some of its airline customers as part of a drive by the jet manufacturer to develop new business opportunities, a company spokeswoman said Friday.
Boeing Enterprises, a new division of the company's commercial airplane group, is looking at maintenance as ""one of many"" new business opportunities, spokeswoman Barbara Murphy said.
""There are things that make it very logical for us to pursue this new business opportunity,"" she said. ""We have an advantage. We know our airplanes better than anyone.""
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Boeing was pushing to take over the heavy-maintenance operations of several major carriers, possibly including British Airways Plc.

MartinWolk,"Microsoft Corp is expected to show a sharp 40 percent jump in quarterly earnings Thursday on strength of the software giant's core business including the latest upgrade to its best-selling Office suite.
On average analysts expect the Redmond, Wash.-based company to post earnings of $0.64 a share for its fiscal third quarter, compared with $0.44 a year ago after adjusting for a split, according to First Call.  
Several analysts predicted revenues in the range of $2.9 billion, up about 32 percent from last year's $2.2 billion and up from $2.68 billion in the December quarter.
""I think on balance it will be a very good quarter,"" said David Readerman, analyst at Montgomery Securities. ""I don't see any motivating factor why they should blow the number out.""
In January, Microsoft launched Office 97, the latest version of its ""productivity"" applications such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $2 billion of the company's $8.7 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues.  
Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from ""platforms"" including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers, which generate about third of the company's revenues.
But analysts said the fastest-growing driver of revenue continues to be the high-end Windows NT operating system and related products for back-end computer servers.
Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs estimated that Microsoft's BackOffice business, including NT, would be up 100 percent over the year-earlier quarter and represent about 20 percent of total revenues.  
Analysts expect results from the current fourth quarter to be similar to the third, but Microsoft has warned that growth is likely to slow in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
""I do expect them to reiterate that fiscal '98 will represent a period of slower growth for the company,"" Sherlund said.
While Microsoft is still benefiting from a mix shift to its more lucrative Windows 95 and Windows NT systems, analysts said it was not clear how planned updates to the products next year would affect revenues.
""They're being very cryptic on pricing,"" said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie. He said Microsoft had delayed release of the products in part because corporate customers were becoming confused by the proliferation of Windows flavors.
Nevertheless, McAdams estimated Microsoft's revenues in fiscal 1998 would rise 27 percent to $13.7 billion.
""The markets they're playing in could double the size of the company,"" he said.

MartinWolk,"Microsoft Corp Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated Thursday that he expects results in the current fourth quarter to be similar to the just-ended third quarter, which he called ""sizzling.""
But in an interview, Brown also said he expects Microsoft's growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons and a lack of planned major new upgrades.  
While the current fourth quarter is expected to show results similar to the $1.04 billion in net income and $3.21 billion in revenues posted for the period that ended March 31, Brown said the first quarter of fiscal 1998 could show a sequential downturn.
Brown said he expected results to rise sequentially after that.  
Brown also said that while the company's high-end Windows NT Workstation operating system is being pre-loaded on some new personal computers, the mix shift was not yet material to Microsoft's so-called OEM (original equipment manufacturer) revenues.
""It's just going to be more of a (fiscal) '99 phenomenon, not a '98 phenomenon,"" he said.
Brown said he expected a spike in revenues from the Office 97 upgrade would begin to tail off in the current quarter, although deferred revenues from product shipped earlier would prevent a sequential downturn.  
The next upgrade of Office will not be out until fiscal 1999, Brown said.
""So fiscal '98 is in the product cycle valley from a comparison standpoint, and that makes the comparison tough, even if business fundamentals are very good,"" Brown said.
And he said he expected the revenue surge from the higher-priced Windows 95 operating system to begin to tail off soon now that the product has been out 20 months.
Brown said he was ""very excited"" about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an ""all-time Olympic record.""
""We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS went up 80 percent,"" he said. ""That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.""

"
MartinWolk,"Microsoft Corp. said Thursday its third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $1.04 billion, well beyond analysts' expectations, on strength in its core Windows business and the new Office 97 upgrade.
The software giant's net income of 79 cents a share compared with earnings of $562 million, or 44 cents a share, in last year's fiscal third quarter. Revenues rose to a record $3.21 billion, a 45 percent increase over the $2.21 billion racked up in the year-ago quarter.
Analysts on average had forecast earnings of 64 cents a share and revenues of about $2.9 billion.
While Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated that he expects growth to slow over the next year, analysts said they were impressed by the software giant's continuing ability to rack up huge gains.
""I was floored,"" said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie, who predicted the stock would rise sharply Friday as analysts jack up their earnings estimates. ""This was a 16-cylinder engine, and all cylinders were working.""
Microsoft released the results after financial markets closed. In Nasdaq trading Thursday Microsoft fell 12.5 cents to $98.125, but the stock rose as high as $102.75 in after-hours trading, dealers said.
Microsoft credited strong revenues from the Office 97 bundle, released in January, which helped drive application and content revenues to $1.53 billion, up 24 percent from the year-earlier period.
But revenues from Microsoft's platform products, including the various Windows operating systems, rose 73 percent to $1.68 billion.
Sales of software preloaded on new computers to the so-called OEM (original equipment manufacturer) channel, rose 51 percent, faster than the PC growth rate, reflecting a continued shift to the higher-priced Windows 95 operating system from the older Windows 3.x.
In an interview, Brown said he expected growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons with year-earlier quarters and a lack of planned major new upgrades.
Brown said he was ""very excited"" about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an ""all-time Olympic record.""
""We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS (earnings per share) went up 80 percent,"" he said. ""That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.""
In fact, he said results from the current fourth quarter would be roughly equivalent to the period that just ended, and he predicted a modest sequential decline in revenues and earnings in the seasonally slow September quarter. But after that sequential growth should resume, Brown said.
Because Microsoft exceeded third-quarter expectations by 15 cents per share, analysts likely will have to raise fiscal 1997 estimates to about $2.65 per share from the previous $2.35, McAdams said. Fiscal 1998 estimates also are likely to be raised, he said.
McAdams also pointed out that the company's ""unearned"" revenues of $1.29 billion included an additional 13 cents per share that was taken in but not recognised as earnings in the quarter. Microsoft defers some revenues to account for costs over the life cycle of products such as Windows and Office.
While Microsoft routinely beats earnings estimates, analysts said they had not even heard a ""whisper"" of the blowout number, and Microsoft's stock has traded in a relatively narrow range over the past two months.
""It's just an extraordinarily well-managed company to deliver that kind of earnings upside on this size of a revenue base,"" said analyst David Readerman of Montgomery Securities.

""Worldwide acceptance of Microsoft Office 97 ignited these outstanding results,"" Brown said in a statement.
Office 97, the latest upgrade of the company's best-selling software package, was launched in January. It combines ""productivity applications"" such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $2 billion of the company's $8.7 billion in the prior fiscal year.
Brown said Microsoft also realised ""solid gains"" from sales of operating systems.
Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from ""platforms,"" including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers, which generate about one-third of the company's revenues.
""However,"" Brown cautioned, ""incredible results like these are seldom duplicated, and we are mindful of the very tough comparisons we will have in fiscal 1998.""
Brown said in the interview that the first quarter of fiscal 1998 could show a downturn from the fourth fiscal quarter of 1997. He said he expected results to rise sequentially after that.
Brown said he expected a spike in revenues from the Office 97 upgrade would begin to tail off in the current quarter, although deferred revenues from product shipped earlier would prevent a sequential downturn.

MartinWolk,"Microsoft Corp. stock surged 10 percent to a record close Friday, a day after the software giant reported an 85 percent increase in quarterly earnings, smashing Wall Street estimates.
Microsoft jumped $9.50 to $107.625 on Nasdaq and was by far the most active issue with nearly 29 million shares changing hands.
While Microsoft keeps expectations low and then routinely surpasses them, analysts were stunned by the results reported late Thursday from the latest quarter, which included earnings that were 23 percent higher than estimates.
""I think it's the best quarter I've ever seen,"" said Scott McAdams, who has watched the company for years as an analayst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. ""I was floored.""
As they always do, Microsoft executives warned they could not sustain the current pace, and analysts agreed growth will slow over the next five quarters, particularly when the company faces comparisons with the period that just ended.
But coupled with better-than-expected earnings from its hardware ally Intel Corp., Microsoft's results reflect fundamental strength in the personal computer industry, analysts said.
""The combination of very strong returns from Microsoft and very strong returns from Intel certainly indicates we're still in an upswing, and I dont believe we've hit the maximum level,"" said Rob Enderle, senior analyst with Giga Information Group.
He and other analysts said the strong sales were being driven by a shift to 32-bit operating systems and applications led by Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system and its Office 97 desktop programmes.
While Windows 95 has been on the market for 20 months, ""the original uptake was not that dramatic,"" particularly among corporate users, said Drew Brosseau of Cowen &amp; Co.
He said only 20 percent of large organisations had moved to a 32-bit desktop from the older 16-bit DOS and Windows operating systems by the end of 1996.
But last year's release of Microsoft's Windows NT version 4.0 cleared a ""logjam"" and triggered the current sales surge by allowing corporate managers to make an informed choice between Microsoft's two main operating systems, Brosseau said.
""It's pretty clear that momentum is going to continue through the end of the year,"" Brosseau said.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has another ace up its sleeve in its line of server software for corporate networks, led by the Windows NT Server operating system and the BackOffice group of applications.
Analyst Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs estimated sales of Microsoft's business systems would rise to $1.5 billion this year from $750 million last year.
Sherlund was among many analysts who raised Microsoft earnings estimates for the current quarter and fiscal 1998, which begins July 1.
First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, said 17 analysts raised estimates to an average of $3.10 a share for fiscal 1998, compared with a previous consensus of $2.72. For the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, the analysts raised estimates to an average $2.62, up from a previous consensus of $2.34.
For its fiscal third quarter ending March 31, Microsoft reported earnings of $1.04 billion or 79 cents a share, compared with $562 million or 44 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of 64 cents a share.
Revenue for the quarter rose to $3.21 billion from $2.21 billion, smashing estimates the company would bring in $2.9 billion in revenues.

Brown said he was ""very excited"" about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an ""all-time Olympic record.""
""We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS (earnings per share) went up 80 percent,"" he said. ""That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.""
In fact, he said results from the current fourth quarter would be roughly equivalent to the period that just ended, and he predicted a modest sequential decline in revenues and earnings in the seasonally slow September quarter. But after that sequential growth should resume, Brown said.
Because Microsoft exceeded third-quarter expectations by 15 cents per share, analysts likely will have to raise fiscal 1997 estimates to about $2.65 per share from the previous $2.35, McAdams said. Fiscal 1998 estimates also are likely to be raised, he said.
McAdams also pointed out that the company's ""unearned"" revenues of $1.29 billion included an additional 13 cents per share that was taken in but not recognized as earnings in the quarter. Microsoft defers some revenues to account for costs over the life cycle of products such as Windows and Office.
While Microsoft routinely beats earnings estimates, analysts said they had not even heard a ""whisper"" of the blowout number, and Microsoft's stock has traded in a relatively narrow range over the past two months.
""It's just an extraordinarily well-managed company to deliver that kind of earnings upside on this size of a revenue base,"" said analyst David Readerman of Montgomery Securities.

MartinWolk,"Microsoft Corp. stock surged almost 10 percent Friday after the software giant reported an 85 percent increase in quarterly earnings, smashing Wall Street estimates.
Microsoft was up $9 at $107.125 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq and was by far the most active issue with 23 million shares changing hands.
While Microsoft keeps expectations low and then routinely surpasses them, analysts were stunned by the results reported late Thursday from the latest quarter, which included earnings that were 23 percent higher than estimates.
""I think it's the best quarter I've ever seen,"" said Scott McAdams, who has watched the company for years as an analayst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. ""I was floored.""
As they always do, Microsoft executives warned they could not sustain the current pace, and analysts agreed growth will slow over the next five quarters, particularly when the company faces comparisons with the period that just ended.
But coupled with better-than-expected earnings from its hardware ally Intel Corp., Microsoft's results reflect fundamental strength in the personal computer industry, analysts said.
""The combination of very strong returns from Microsoft and very strong returns from Intel certainly indicates we're still in an upswing, and I dont believe we've hit the maximum level,"" said Rob Enderle, senior analyst with Giga Information Group.
He and other analysts said the strong sales were being driven by a shift to 32-bit operating systems and applications led by Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system and its Office 97 desktop programmes.
While Windows 95 has been on the market for 20 months, ""the original uptake was not that dramatic,"" particularly among corporate users, said Drew Brosseau of Cowen &amp; Co.
He said only 20 percent of large organisations had moved to a 32-bit desktop from the older 16-bit DOS and Windows operating systems by the end of 1996.
But last year's release of Microsoft's Windows NT version 4.0 cleared a ""logjam"" and triggered the current sales surge by allowing corporate managers to make an informed choice between Microsoft's two main operating systems, Brosseau said.
""It's pretty clear that momentum is going to continue through the end of the year,"" Brosseau said.
Meanwhile Microsoft has another ace up its sleeve in its line of server software for corporate networks, led by the Windows NT Server operating system and the BackOffice group of applications.
Analyst Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs estimated sales of Microsoft's business systems would rise to $1.5 billion this year from $750 million last year.
Sherlund was among many analysts who raised Microsoft earnings estimates for the current quarter and the fiscal year that begins July 1.
For its fiscal third quarter ending March 31, Microsoft reported earnings of $1.04 billion or 79 cents a share, compared with $562 million or 44 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of 64 cents a share.
Revenue for the quarter rose to $3.21 billion from $2.21 billion, smashing estimates the company would bring in $2.9 billion in revenues.

MartinWolk,"Microsoft Corp. Monday plans to announce a version of its Windows 95 operating system for hand-held consumer devices that will be available this year, according to sources familiar with the company's plans.
The Windows CE system for consumer electronics comes two years after Microsoft scuttled a similar project known as Winpad because its intensive memory requirements would have made the hardware too costly.
Since then the explosive growth of the Internet has expanded the market possibilities for small wireless devices, while Microsoft rival Oracle Corp. has popularised the concept of a $500 consumer device for accessing the Internet.
Microsoft officials declined to comment, but the company said it would have an announcement early Monday on ""a significant addition in the area of Microsoft Windows platform software.""
Microsoft executives previously had disclosed plans to supply a system for hand-held devices in time for the holiday season.
The devices, ranging from a ""smart"" wireless telephone to personal organisers with communcations capabilities, will be marketed by eight computer and consumer electronics companies including Hewlett-Packard Co., Casio Computer Co. Ltd., and Philips Electronics NV, industry analysts said.
The operating system will include stripped-down versions of Microsoft's Word and Excel applications and are likely to have some ability to get information off the Internet's World Wide Web.
But with their tiny, monochrome screens, analysts believe they will be used at first largely for accessing electronic mail and personal information such as telephone numbers and appointments.
""The Web doesn't look good on a 4-inch screen,"" said analyst Mike McGuire of Dataquest. ""What this is about is Internet transactions and communications.""
While hand-held ""personal digital assistants"" such as Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton have been available for several years the products have failed to grow beyond a niche category in part because of the difficulty of swapping information between them and desktop computers, analysts say.
Microsoft aims to break that logjam with its new system, built for RISC microprocessors from Hitachi and others rather than the Intel Corp. processors used for most Windows-based computers.
But at $500 -- or close to $1,000 for a machine fully loaded with communications accessories -- price will continue to be an obstacle, said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group, who said the ""sweet spot"" for small devices was about $300.
""I don't really think the market is going to really jump off in big number until next year,"" he said.
McGuire of Dataquest estimated worldwide shipments of hand-held devices would rise to at least 5 million units a year by the end of the decade from the current 1 million.
While that's still relatively small compared with a personal computer market of about 60 million units annually, Microsoft needs to protect its Windows franchise from any potential incursion, said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.
""If you let someone else get that operating system, over time someone could start working that system upmarket,"" he said. ""Microsoft needs to be a player here.""
Microsoft move into hand-held systems could pose a threat to U.S. Robotics Corp. and Britain's Psion Software Plc, two of the most successful marketers of proprietary hand-held products.
The Windows CE system also could be licensed for use with a rival to Oracle's  Network Computer, analysts said.

MartinWolk,"Boeing Co. said Monday first-quarter profit more than doubled and sales rose 70 percent as it ramped up airplane production, but the results disappointed Wall Street and the company's stock tumbled.
Boeing said it earned $313 million, or 87 cents a share, in the quarter, excluding an accounting credit, compared with $119 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue soared to $7.32 billion from $4.29 billion.
But Boeing's net income was 13 percent below the Wall Street consensus of $1 a share, according to First Call, and its stock fell $6.625 to close at $95.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most active issue.
""The stock is down because earnings came in quite a bit below the consensus. That's it in a nutshell,"" said Peter Jacobs, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle.
Analysts said Boeing's earnings were hurt by higher-than-expected expenses for new airplane models and other projects including a commercial space venture.
The company also said it was incurring significant overtime costs as it increases production to meet rising demand and warned that profit margins would be under pressure for the rest of the year.
""It's sort of a wake-up call to some analysts who I think have been a little too optimistic about their margins,"" said analyst Bob Toomey of Piper Jaffray.
Boeing said profit margins would be lower for the rest of the year because of a shift toward deliveries of the new 777 and next-generation 737 models. New models carry lower profit margins until the company has written down the costs of production equipment.
At the annual shareholders meeting, Chairman Phil Condit said the two new models would account for half of Boeing's production next year, but he said the industry's fundamentals remained strong.
""I'm very optimistic about the upturn in our commercial airplane business as well as our prospects in defence and space,"" Condit said. ""We're excited about the future of this company.""
Boeing delivered 68 commercial aircraft in the quarter, up from 40 in the year-earlier period when production was still hampered by the effects of a 10-week strike.
For this year, Boeing reiterated that it expects to deliver 340 jets and generate revenue of $33 billion, compared with 218 jets and revenues of $22.7 billion last year.
That includes former defence and space operations of Rockwell International Corp., absorbed in December, but not the planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Boeing executives say will be completed in August, adding about $15 billion of annual revenue.
Analysts expect Boeing production to continue rising in 1998 to about 450 jets as the world's biggest commercial planemaker works to meet surging industry demand.
""You expect that if you're ramping up rates there would be some costs incurred, and that's clearly what's happening,"" said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities.
But he said he was encouraged that Boeing still expects to meet its production target for the year.
""There always is a significant risk of running into some sort of shortfall, and all of a sudden you wind up with airplanes that ... are most of the way done and missing some critical parts,"" he said.
That happened to Boeing in the late 1960s, when the company nearly went bankrupt, he said.
This time around there is no such danger, as the company said it had $5.5 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, up slightly from three months early. Boeing's backlog rose to $89.2 billion from $87.7 billion three months earlier, chiefly because of new defence contracts.
Boeing also recorded a $64 million accounting credit related to an employee-benefit trust fund.
Boeing shares were also pressured by other factors, including a report in the London Times that Boeing rivals Lockheed Martin Corp. and Airbus Industrie were discussing a possible merger.
An Airbus spokeswoman denied the report Monday but said the European consortium was in discussions with many aerospace companies, particularly about joining its proposed A3XX jumbo jet project.
At the shareholders meeting, Condit reiterated that he was optimistic Boeing would complete its planned merger with McDonnell Douglas despite concerns raised by European Union authorities. A special meeting of Boeing shareholders to approve the merger has been set for July 25.

"
MartinWolk,"Teledesic Inc., the communications startup mostly owned by Seattle billionaires Bill Gates and Craig McCaw, Tuesday picked Boeing Co. to build and deploy its planned $9 billion satellite network.
Boeing also will invest up to $100 million in Teledesic, giving it a 10 percent stake in the privately-held company, which plans to launch 288 low-orbiting satellites by 2002 to form an ""Internet in the sky.""
Teledesic Chief Executive Officer David Twyver said the Kirkland, Wash.-based company talked to virtually all the world's major aerospace companies before settling on Seattle neighbour Boeing as prime contractor for the ambitious project.
""But let me say that no one company can do everything that has to be done here,"" Twyver said in an interview.
""We expect that most of the major aerospace and telecommunications companies if they're interested in being part of this will find room in it,"" he said.
The contract is a major victory for Boeing, which is counting on commercial ventures to provide growth for its rapidly expanding defence and space business
Boeing's partly-owned Sea Launch Co. is building a mobile, ocean-based satellite launch platform, and the aerospace giant is expanding its space business aggressively through the recently completed acquisition of Rockwell International Corp. units and the planned purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
""Our relationship with Teledesic is the perfect catalyst for bringing together all of our historical investments in the space business with our recent and planned investments in Sea Launch, Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas,"" Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit said.
Teledesic, initially formed by McCaw, a pioneer in the cellular telephone industry, and Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., has scaled back its initial plans for a network of 840 small satellites more than 400 miles in the air, Twyver said.
Instead, the company now plans to provide the same international coverage with a network of slightly larger satellites orbiting about twice as high above the earth -- still far lower than current communications satellites launched into geosynchronous orbit 22,500 miles up.
Teledesic executives say their network will provide communication comparable to land-based fiber optics, including transmission of voice, data and video, between any two points on Earth equipped with the small dishes needed to link to the low-orbiting satellites.
Other satellite projects in the works, such as Motorola Inc.'s 66-satellite Iridium project, aim to provide voice and data links to mobile users, more like today's cellular telephones.
""We expect our customers to be companies rather than individuals, initially at least,"" Twyver said. ""Almost every company now is putting mission-critical internal applications on Internet-style backbones, and they'll need to get access to every one of their sites.""
Teledesic plans to market the service directly in the United States and is in talks with major telecommunications companies overseas for resale rights.
Twyver said Teledesic is ""very well funded"" now but will be looking for other industrial risk-sharing partners to build out the network.
Boeing likely will build the satellites at a cost of several million dollars each on a mass-production line in its current facilities.
Up to 16 satellites then will be packed onto each rocket for launch over an 18-month period beginning in 2001. Various launch vehicles are expected to be used.
Twyver said the production schedule allows for an 8 percent satellite failure rate, which he said was cheaper than insuring every satellite.
The final configuration will include 12 ""beaded necklaces"" of 24 satellites each orbiting the Earth in different planes, with the option of adding more satellites later.
With the Boeing investment, Gates and McCaw each will own about one-third of Teledesic. AT&amp;T Co.'s AT&amp;T Wireless, which bought McCaw's cellular business, owns about 10 percent of Teledesic, with venture capital investors owning the rest.

MartinWolk,"Nike Inc., the world's largest maker of athletic footwear, reported a 24 percent jump in first-quarter profits Monday, reflecting strong demand for its shoes and apparel around the world.
The Beaverton, Ore.-based company also announced a two-for-one stock split, its second in two years.
For the three months ended Aug. 31, Nike earned $226.1 million, or $1.53 a share, up from $182.1 million or $1.25 a share a year ago. Revenues jumped 34 percent to $2.28 billion from $1.70 billion last year.
The earnings were slightly better than the $1.51 a share industry analysts had expected on average.
But the company's stock jumped sharply on news that Nike had taken orders for $3.5 billion in footwear and apparel through January, a 66 percent increase over the year-earlier period, analysts said.
""The futures were up beyond anybody's expectations,"" said Shelly Hale Young of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, who said few expected Nike to top the 55 percent increase in advance orders reported three months ago.
As a result, she and other analysts raised their Nike earnings estimates for the rest of the year, and Nike stock rose $2.375 to a record close of $121.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
""Management is very pleased with these results,"" Nike Chairman Phil Knight said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.
In a statement, he said Nike's ""brand strength, which many thought was nearing its peak last year, continues to grow unabated in fiscal 1997.""
Indeed U.S. sales of Nike footwear surged 27 percent to over $1 billion in the quarter, while the overall market is growing at only about an 8 percent rate.
Young of Hambrecht &amp; Quist said she expected Nike to raise its share of the U.S. footwear market to 43 percent by the end of the fiscal year from 37 percent, with most of the increase coming at the expense of rival Reebok International Ltd.
The increase is coming even as Nike imposes a 7 percent rise in the price of its shoes, which can top $100 a pair.
Young said Nike's aggressive marketing and focus on footwear technology have given it the edge.
""They have the better shoes and they have the brand that consumers want to buy, and therefore they can increase prices,"" she said.
Overseas, where Nike is not as well established in all markets, Nike sales rose 35 percent from last year's first quarter to $781 million, a figure that was hurt by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar.
The company also continued its strong performance in ahtletic apparel, where sales surged to $584 million, a 75 percent increase.
At the company's annual shareholders meeting in Beaverton, Ore., Knight and others strongly defended the company against rising criticism of its overseas manufacturing practices.
Shareholders overwhelmingly defeated a proposal for independent monitoring of the factories introduced by the United Methodist Church.
Knight blamed media reports for distorting Nike's record and said the company generally pays twice the minimum wage in countries where it operates.
He said the company recently had discovered ""horrible conditions"" among Pakistani workers -- including children -- sewing soccer balls at home under contract for Nike and had worked to establish centralized sewing centers that would eliminate the abuses.
Nike outside directors Jill Conway and John Thompson said they had traveled recently to Indonesia and Vietnam and were generally satisfied by factory conditions.

MatthewBunce,"Declared cocoa arrivals at Ivorian ports for Ivory Coast's 1996/97 (October-April) main crop totalled 970-980,000 tonnes by April 14, close to record levels seen in the 1995/96 season, exporters and crop analysts said.
The 1995/96 main crop (ending April 30) reached just over a million tonnes.
""Arrivals are now at a trickle compared to last year but it is still possible the total (main crop) will reach a million by the end of the month,"" said one crop analyst.
Exporters said cocoa was arriving at Ivory Coast's two ports -- Abidjan and San Pedro -- at a total of up to 5,000 tonnes a week, compared to 8,000 tonnes a week in 1995/96.
Little or no main crop cocoa remained on south-western plantations visited by Reuters. ""Cocoa is now for the mid-crop (usually smaller, poorer quality beans),"" said one coastal area buyer.
Ivory Coast has forecast 950,000 tonnes for the 1996/97 season but some private forecasters upgraded their full-year predictions from that level to around 1.1 million tonnes after large arrivals in early 1997.
Last year, Ivory Coast produced a full-year record of 1.2 million tonnes after a bumper 200,000 tonne mid-crop (May-September).
Sources said Ministry of Agriculture data showed cocoa arrivals to April 4 (from October 24) stood at 940,0000 tonnes -- about six percent down from 1,003,366 last year. Another 40,000 tonnes or so should be added to the 1996/97 figure as the season opened three weeks later than the usual October 1, they said.
Other arrivals data seen by Reuters gave similar figures.
""The latest figures I have from the Caistab (cocoa and coffee marketing board) show arrivals at about 975,000 by April 14 but that is after some downward adjustments for sub-grade (inferior beans),"" said one source.
Arrivals to the end of the main crop in 1994/95 were 815,000 tonnes, with weekly arrivals of under 4,000 tonnes.
Trade sources say exporters usually over-estimate arrivals early in the season to help secure bank finance, but square accounts later in the season by under-declaring.
Crop forecasters say declared arrivals in Ivory Coast can exceed tree crop harvests as quantities of cocoa are carried between seasons in the hope of price rises and to mix poor with good quality cocoa.
One cocoa buyer for Ivorian exporter Jean-Abile Gal (JAG) said the latest cocoa bean sizes averaged 98 beans per 100 grammes at San Pedro, and 105 at the main port, Abidjan -- against an export standard of up to 105 with less than eight percent humidity.
Exporters said average humidity levels at both ports were below eight percent.
Up-country buyers' stores in coastal and south-western areas were mostly empty, except for coffee, but larger warehouses at San Pedro, including JAG's, were still well stocked.
""There is nothing left. Some exporters are desperate to meet contracts and cannot get cocoa,"" said one buyer. ""Cocoa harvested now is really for the mid-crop (from May).""
Port forwarders' figures seen by Reuters showed 1996/97 cocoa volumes handled 12 percent down on 1995/96, but managers said warehouse stocks for end-April shipment would close the gap.
""It is very acceptable. We thought the gap could be twice that,"" said a manager for SAGA, San Pedro's largest forwarder. ""Last year, arrivals figures were a lot more available so it has been harder to track.""
Cocoa bean shipments rose from 39,637 tonnes in February to 51,981 in March and at least another 10,000 tonnes was due to leave next week.
""Some of what is left in stores will be for local processors (using around 135,000 tonnes of beans a year),"" said one crop analyst.
SACO, San Pedro's only factory, had large volumes of produce stored in sheds with bagged cocoa under external awnings. Cocoa product exports totalled around 4,000 tonnes for February and March.
Several new warehouses are planned to increase port cocoa storage capacity. New factories are also in the pipeline.
Exporters are now looking forward to pod counters' mid-crop predictions, expected this month, and further news on Ivory Coast's intention to destroy illegal cocoa plantations in classified forest areas.
The country's Minister for Commodities, Guy-Alain Gauze, said earlier on Friday in the Netherlands that the upcoming mid-crop would be somewhere near 100,000 tonnes.
"
MatthewBunce,"Ivory Coast's second port of San Pedro is gearing up to play an increasingly important role in the key cocoa and coffee sector -- both as a shipper and as a processor of the beans.
Three large new warehouses are under construction and the first of two planned cocoa processing factories is nearing the tendering stage.
""A factory site has been chosen and construction is about to go out to tender,"" said a spokesman for Abidjan-based Ivorian exporter ERAF.
""When a bidder has been selected ground-levelling starts and work will be around the clock to open in March 1998,"" export manager Claude Caissagnon told Reuters.
ERAF has announced plans for a 25,000 tonnes a year bean processing plant in San Pedro with Paris-based partner, Orebi and Dutch firm Nederland.
Plans for a second factory by Ivorian group SOLEGI are less clear but San Pedro exporters told Reuters they expect it to go ahead.
Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa crop by the year 2000 to boost export value.
Industry sources point to attractive tax incentives behind a spate of industrial development in and around San Pedro - including cocoa and coffee industries and timber sawmills.
Three private factories can already process up to 160,000 tonnes of cocoa beans a year but after a record 1995/96 harvest of 1.2 million tonnes exporters doubt the 50 percent target date will be met.
Caissagnon said ERAF's planned factory -- producing only cocoa butter and cake -- could expand capacity to 75,000 tonnes/year. Existing Ivorian factories also produce powder and cocoa mass by grinding beans.
San Pedro's importance has grown with rising southwestern cocoa output since 1990.
A loosening of commodity marketing by the state Caistab cocoa board has also meant buyers' transport costs are lower than to the main eastern, port of Abidjan.
Port arrivals of cocoa for the 1996/97 season are already close to end-April 1995/96 levels of around one million tonnes as young, hybrid plants in the area around San Pedro have swollen local output.
Ivory Coast wants to limit long-term annual production to around one million tonnes and has said it will destroy illegal farms in classified forests.
Three warehouses under construction are due to be ready by the 1997/98 season (Oct-Sept). Construction managers said the warehouses would be owned by Omais, a Lebanese coffee and cocoa buyer and exporters PACI and SHAC.
An accute shortage of warehouse space in 1995/96 meant trucks of cocoa were left stranded at port approach roads.
Ivorian forwarder SIVOM was also expanding warehouse space and extra space could result from laws limiting exports of tropical timber, he added.
National bean processing capacity is set to increase to 180,000 tonnes later this year with the addition of capacity to Abidjan-based UNICAO -- part-owned by U.S.-based Archer Daniel Midland (ADM).
Up to four other factory proposals, apart from ERAF's, could raise capacity to well over 400,000 tonnes over the next few years.
SACO, Ivory Coast's largest cocoa processor, owned by Europe's Callebaut Barry group, has two factories with a total capacity of around 90,000 tonnes. Its second plant at the northern entrance to San Pedro opened in the 1995/96 season.
""ERAF's site is on the opposite side of the road from SACO with access routes possible from Sassandra and Soubre directions,"" said Caissagnon.
"
MatthewBunce,"The 1996/97 cocoa harvest in central Ivory Coast could be earlier than in the main southwest growing area and more prolonged if good rains continue for the next few months, buyers in the central region said.
""October and November will be the strongest,"" said Daloa-based private buyer Antoine El-Hayek.
""A total of 950,000 tonnes would be surprising...the harvest now depends on good rain before January,"" he told Reuters, adding, ""Mould is a danger. With this humidity and no sun, drying has been hard.""
Other buyers expected main crop quality to be better in 1996/97 than this year because farmers could spend more time treating the smaller harvest.
Forecasters predict a 1996/97 main crop of 850,000 to 900,000 tonnes against one million in 1995/96.
Pod sizes on farms seen by Reuters between Daloa and the central town of Gagnoa suggested a relatively early start to the season and a bigger harvest in early 1997 than further south.
But there was little flowering, indicating weaker March harvests.
Good quantities of early main-crop cocoa were seen drying on the roadsides between Daloa and Gagnoa.
Buyers said they were not stocking 1995/96 mid-crop cocoa and they had seen little being stored by farmers.
""There is a little in the bush, but not much, and that is (being held by) those who are not in a hurry for cash,"" private buyer Makkram Haddad said.
Farmers are often squeezed for cash at this time of the year because of the cost of sending children back to school in October.
The manager of a cooperative store in Gagnoa said he aimed to attract more cocoa by paying farmers a 30 CFA a kg bonus at the end of the season. This would come out of the transport commission element in the marketing price structure set by the government at the start of each season.
A large competing buyer had recently set up in Gagnoa, he added.
He expected 1996/97 cocoa purchases in the Gagnoa area to be on a par with 1995/96, despite lower tree yields.
Marketing in the area had been disrupted by civil disturbances in the run-up to last October's presidential election, he said.
Pesticide use on farms remained minimal, according to the cooperative's figures on sales of Endosulfan and Diazinon-based products, which were used to fight capsid attacks.
The store manager said many farmers found the cost of a full spraying programme prohibitive. Annual treatment of a typical three hectare farm would cost around 55,000 CFA.
"
MatthewBunce,"Ivory Coast is destroying some cocoa farms in its protected forests but the impact on 1996/97 (October-September) output will be minimal as officials await clear eviction plans, forestry officials and crop analysts say.
""Nothing has really been done,"" said one state forest agency (SODEFOR) manager.
""We are told to get them (farmers) out but we are waiting for practical policies on the way to go ahead,"" south coast area manager Tanoh Yao told Reuters during a recent tour of protected forests.
Ivory Coast said in March that 30 percent of protected forests were ""illegally occupied"" by up to 450,000 farmers and their relatives, growing up to 100,000 tonnes, roughly one-tenth of the 1996/97 cocoa crop.
World Bank officials put the figure at around 50,000 tonnes.
The March 7 decree said officials would ""systematically destroy all plantations in parks and reservations"" to stop clearance of classified forests and national parks. A ""decontamination"" period would allow individual cases to be considered and give farmers time to quit farms.
No timetable or details of implementation were given.
Crop analysts expect Ivorian forest protection plans to bite in 5-10 years as World Bank and international pressure grows, but they predict limited action over the next few years.
""(The evictions) could be bluff so we do not expect any short-term effect,"" said one, adding that ""illegal"" output was impossible to quantify. ""The (""illegal"") yield would change each year with tree age and as planters move around.""
Donors say protected forest cover has dropped to 3.6 million hectares from 13 million at the time of independence from France in 1960.
SODEFOR offices in forest areas have displayed copies of the decree near entrances next to local newspaper articles on evictions of farmers and destruction of cocoa trees.
Yao said some farms had been destroyed in increasingly productive forests bordering the large Tai National Park in south-west Ivory Coast near Liberia, but elsewhere the action had been limited.
""At Guiglo (western district) and around Tai, it has begun,"" said Yao. ""(SODEFOR) is also replanting along roadsides as a first step to cut down on access to deeper forest areas.""
Up-country buyers say a large SODEFOR base north of Ivory Coast's increasingly important cocoa export port at San Pedro has recently been expanded.
""People had one-hectare farms or so but then chopped more and more forest down. Now there are no more animals so we have to walk 20 km to hunt,"" said one village cooperative buyer for a main Ivorian exporter. ""The policy is a good idea.""
Exporters said one farmer had lodged a complaint with San Pedro's prefect in April after eviction from a nearby farm outside Meadji. Others in deep forest areas had also been hit.
Crop analysts say large swathes of protected forest have been cut down but farming techniques there were poor.
Tai forest officials say loosely-defined tenure laws could make the destruction of plantations and villages difficult.
""The farmers are in negotiations with SODEFOR. Some of them have been in the forest for 20 years so we don't know where they will be lodged,"" says Commandant Koffi N'Dri, head of the Tai forest protection unit PACPNT (Projet Autonome pour la Conservation du Parc National du Tai.
""Illegal production in Tai itself is very small but in the surrounding forests it is another matter,"" he added.
Tribal chiefs south of Tai said oil palm plantation owners had destroyed more forest than cocoa and coffee growers.
""In five or 10 years we will no longer have any forest in our region,"" one Tai forest chief told Reuters.
""There is some cocoa and coffee but it is closer to main roads,"" he said. ""(The state says it owns) the forest but we want to rent land so at least our children have a future.""
Palm oil firms had chopped down forest and recruited villagers to work plantations without any rent or tenure provisions.
Refugees from neighbouring Liberia's war had mainly planted food crops, rather than cocoa and coffee, chiefs and missionaries living in south-western forest areas told Reuters.
""Oil palm prices are better than for cocoa here,"" said one priest near the Liberian border.
"
MatthewBunce,"Heavy April rains in Ivorian cocoa areas have favoured mid-crop (May-Sept) pod growth and flowering for early 1997/98 main crop (Oct-April) harvests, weather and crop analyts said on Thursday.
""At the end of March we were at 109 percent of the 10-year average (Jan-Mar) in all but a few areas,"" said one crop analyst. ""I would say April has been about average but the last 10 days will give the overall picture.""
National weather centre forecasters said coastal and inland areas, particularly around Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, had received well above average levels in the first 20 days of April. ""If rains are heavy for the last 10 days of April you can say the (long) rainy season has begun (usually lasting until August).""
Many crop analysts use private data from undisclosed areas but official weather data for the first 20 days of April showed rains at 10 weather stations averaged 78.85 mm. A total of 95 mm fell in the first 10 days of April and 693.5 in the second.
One crop analyst put overall 1997 rainfall at just below average. Another said rains had risen to 145 mm against his 10-year average figure of 134 mm for 12 stations. Rains in some areas had been between 35-145 percent above normal.
""March and April have been good and recent rains also seem quite heavy,"" said one. ""April could be close to its average.""
March rains averaged 111 mm, against crop analysts' long-term averages ranging from 80-90 mm. February rains of 10 mm (against a usual 50 mm average) had threatened mid crop potential until rain fell later, crop analysts said.
Young flowers for 1997/98 main crop harvests where more abundant than at the same time last year but accurate predictions of harvests would not be possible until June onwards, analysts said.
Crop analysts' estimates of the 1996/97 midcrop range between 150,000 tonnes and 200,000 tonnes but rains into May will partly determine harvests. Arrivals stood at 970-980,000 tonnes by mid April.
""Mid-crop assessments are particularly difficult. You need to visit four times as many sites for an accurate indication because of the smaller number of pods involved,"" one explained.
Mid-crop arrivals, with smaller bean sizes than last year's export grade harvests (up to 105 beans/100 grammes), are expected from early May -- against mid-April last year.
One set of official weather data show rainfall averages for the first three months of 1997 were 34.6, 11.3 and 100 mm respectively -- against 14.2, 50.2 and 64.9 in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 season.
The long-term averages for the same three months (1987-96) were 13.6, 37.4, 83.2. For April, the average was 130.4.
The latest April 1997 data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of April in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed):
Daloa 0.2 (105.8), Gagnoa 0 (142.8), San Pedro 0 (18.3), Tabou 0.4 (1.0) Man 5.4 (98.7), Dimbokro 18.3 (73.2), Yamoussoukro 22.1 (83.8), Abidjan 0 (128.8), Sassandra 0 (10.6), Adiake 33.7 (64.5), Korhogo 15.1 (14.2).
For the second 10 days of April, the rains were:
Daloa 49.3, Gagnoa 63.7, San Pedro 47.1, Tabou 57.0, Man 29.3, Dimbokro 22.2, Yamoussoukro 107.7, Abidjan 156.5, Sassandra 39.1, Adiake 69.9, Korogho 51.7.

MatthewBunce,"Ivory Coast opened talks with donors on Monday on implementing reform of the cocoa and coffee sector to qualify for the final part of a loan for agricultural restructuring.
Donors said agreement on releasing the final $45 million of a $150 million loan may not be reached until 1998.
""We will mainly discuss cocoa and coffee but some questions will probably not be resolved until the end of the year,"" said a World Bank official attending the talks, which end on May 7.
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, has declined to release trading data to the World Bank on an export-contract auction set up last May with the help of donor funds. The Bank would like to know volumes, prices and dates of trades at the auctions but Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan has said the figures were commercially confidential.
Industry sources have complained that the auction encourages price speculation and overbidding to win export contracts. They also complain that auction contract rules on shipment dates and bid confirmation are not enforced.
Some exporters have already complained of difficulties in obtaining contracts because larger companies can bid above world market rates because of better access to finance. That threatens the viability of smaller exporters and market competition.
Exporters and the World Bank failed to agree on three proposed changes to auction rules when European Union, IMF and French development agency officials last met for talks on the system in September 1996.
Exporters, the World Bank and European industry officials subsequently proposed changes in auction rules to ensure cocoa quality. The Ivory Coast has not responded directly to those proposals.
Industry delegates are due in Ivory Coast in mid-May for follow-up talks aimed at finding a solution to concerns about the auction and quality.
Coffee sector talks have recently focused on how to liberalise marketing while maintaining adequate quality checks.
A report laying out options for Ivory Coast by British Consultant Landell Mills was expected in January but lack of guidance from Ivory Coast on which options to develop had delayed completion, said one donor.
""They are now in the process of writing it,"" he added, without indicating a delivery date.
The structural reforms to be funded by the loan also include the rice, sugar and cotton sectors.

MatthewBunce,"Ivory Coast exported 16,307 tonnes of robusta coffee beans in March, against 13,527 in February and 20,903 in March 1996, official shipping data show.
Ivorian coffee marketing started later than usual in 1996/97 after low world prices in late 1996, tighter bank lending policies to exporters and quality problems that slowed grading, exporters said.
""This year is slower but there is still plenty of coffee about,"" said one industry buyer, noting that the season opened in mid-November rather than October.
The data showed 12,904 tonnes of March exports went from Abidjan, the main port, with 3,403 shipped from Ivory Coast's second port of San Pedro.
Cumulative exports in the first six months of the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) season were 45,783 tonnes against 58,667 in the same period of 1995/96.
Coffee product exports, from Abidjan, included 694 tonnes of soluble coffee and six tonnes of roasted coffee.
Ivory Coast forecast a 1996/97 crop of 230,000 tonnes, against 180,000 tonnes recorded last year.
Port sources put arrivals by late March 1997 at over 175,000 tonnes but said Ivory Coast would at least meet its full year output forecast.
Some buyers are still sorting and grading at stores and say more coffee is still held in villages.
But they said the quality of coffee sacks had also been poor in some areas due a shortage of supply from exporters. Piles of loose coffee awaiting grading could be seen in upcountry buyers' stores last week.

MatthewBunce,"Cocoa bean exports from Ivory Coast jumped to 171,104 tonnes in March, against 148,827 in February and 169,065 in March 1996, official shipping data show.
March exports and bean quality were similar to last year's levels even though the 1996/97 crop is expected by pod counters to fall short of last year's 1.2 million tonne record, exporters said.
""Last year there was a demand peak earlier in the year but this year demand came later,"" said one shipper. ""March (1997) has been one of the biggest shipment months ever so we are looking hard at the (export) figures.""
Abidjan handled 119,123 tonnes of March 1997 exports with a further 51,981 tonnes leaving via the second port of San Pedro.
Cumulative exports for the first six months of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) totalled 767,337 tonnes, against 722,646 by the end of March in 1995/96.
""The average bean count so far has been 101 (beans per 100 grams) so quality has been very good,"" said the exporter, adding that bean sizes last week averaged 100/100 grams.
Ivory Coast's bean export standard is 105 beans per 100 grams with less than eight percent humidity.
Some upcountry buyers have pointed to slipping bean sizes ahead of the mid-crop (May-Sept).
The main destinations for March exports from Abidjan were broadly the same as last year. North-west European ports received 85,198 tonnes, with 60,812 for Amsterdam. U.S. east coast ports took 17,161, including 13,865 for New York.
Separate figures by destination for San Pedro were not immediately available.
Shipments from the two ports during the main January and March cocoa contract months totalled 166,268 tonnes and 171,104 tonnes, against 174,927 and 169,065 last year.
Some shipments loaded in late February 1997 had probably been recorded as March exports, said one shipper.
""The (export) figure is very high for one month but bulk shipments might have put the volume up,"" he added.
Ivory Coast produced a crop of 1.2 million tonnes in 1995/96 and private forecasts for 1996/97 range up to at least 1.15 million tonnes.
Port arrivals stood at around 982,000 tonnes by mid-April as the main crop (Oct-April) tailed off, compared with 1.03 million tonnes in 1995/96, industry sources said this week.
Analysts have made preliminary harvest estimates of up to 180,000 tonnes for the mid-crop (May-Sept), but steady rains needed into June will partly determine final volumes.
Ivory Coast has not revised its 1996/97 total crop forecast of 950,000 tonnes, but U.K.-based broker GNI cut on Wednesday set its full year 1996/97 Ivory Coast cocoa crop estimate at 1.15 million tonnes.
GNI sharply cut its estimate of this year's world cocoa supply deficit from 180,000 tonnes to 33,000.

"
MatthewBunce,"Ivory Coast is set for a bumper 1996/97 (October-September) coffee crop because of favourable weather and better farm maintenance but buyers point to quality problems, industry and port sources said on Wednesday.
With five months of the 1996/97 season remaining, exporters and crop analysts expect a total crop of up to 300,000 tonnes, against 180,000 tonnes last year and Ivory Coast's official forecast of 230,000 tonnes.
Port arrivals by April 17 totalled 228,000 tonnes compared with 150,000 tonnes by the same time last year, suggesting a return to pre-1990s levels.
Exporters said markets would be found for the increased supply of poor grades. But one quality inspector said it was unlikely the full 1996/97 crop would be shipped because of wastage and rejection.
Precise warehouse stocks were not known but the latest export and arrivals figures suggested stocks of well over 150,000 tonnes, after allowing for offtake by local roasters.
""There's still more coffee upcountry but it is coming down slowly,"" one upcountry buyer told Reuters. ""Farmers are holding back because buyers have been offering such low prices.""
Coffee marketing started slowly after the season opened later than usual in mid-November. A fall in world prices in December, stricter bank lending policies for export financing, and poor quality slowed movement of the crop from farms to ports.
Ivory Coast set a farmgate price of 695 CFA ($1.20) a kg for 1995/96 but slashed the rate as world prices dropped in late 1996, leaving the Caistab state marketing board with a large paper loss after domestic price-stabilisation payments to exporters.
Quality problems this year have meant buyers offered farmers as little as 300 CFA per kg compared to the Caistab's guideline price of 500 CFA. But one industry buyer paid over 500 CFA for premium quality beans.
""Farmers harvested the coffee in October but no-one started buying until a couple of months ago,"" said one crop analyst. ""Coffee is usually harvested in January (after cocoa) so there was a long storage period and the beans turned black.""
The output rise was caused by mild weather in the January-March 1996 flowering period. That was boosted by a peak in the general three-year cycle which sees trees yielding a weak, then moderate and finally strong crop.
""Prices were better in 1995/96 so farmers took more care over pruning trees...and general maintenance,"" one analyst said. ""That is paying off this year as tree yields have gone up.""
The manager of one plantation said better maintenance meant some farms were yielding 600 kg a hectare, compared to 450 last year.
Arrivals are running far ahead of 1996/97 exports which reached a cumulative total of 45,783 tonnes by end-March, compared to 58,667 tonnes from a smaller crop by the same date in 1995/96.
Exporters have built up stores which need sorting and regrading.
""The season will be twice as long as usual,"" one buyer in the productive northwestern district around Man told Reuters in January -- when coffee marketing usually starts.
Rains in December hampered drying of beans. Farmers had also harvested a mixture of ripe and unripe cherries and had not separated them before sale, buyers said.
Upcountry stores visited by Reuters in mid-April had small stocks of coffee awaiting grading or regrading. Some coffee had been stored loose because of a shortage of jute bags supplied by exporters.
Ivory Coast aims to boost exports to the level of 300,000 tonnes per year seen before the early 1990s when a drop in world prices discouraged maintenance of trees by farmers.
Buyers and crop analysts said plans to rehabilitate plantations, funded by donors, had yet to have any noticeable effect.
""They may be talking about it, but no farmers I have met have received any payments,"" said one crop analyst.
"
MatthewBunce,"Rains continued across Ivory Coast's cocoa belt in late April, confirming the onset of wet season patterns and boosting mid-crop (May-Sept) and early 1996/97 main crop (Oct-April) prospects, weather and crop analysts said on Tuesday.
""A favourable weather pattern developed in April with strengthening rains in many areas,"" said one weather analyst, adding that a band of rain usually sitting 200 km south of the region's tropical weather front was now over cocoa areas.
""There have been some heavy rains but so far the flowers (for the 1997/98 maincrop) have held on,"" said one crop analyst.
Official rainfall data for the third 10 days of April totalled 789.2 mm against 693.5 mm in the previous 10 days and 95.2 mm for the first 10 days of the month.
Rains fell mainly in south coast areas between Abidjan and Tabou but steady rains also fell in other key growing areas around Gagnoa. Rains were lightest in northern areas.
One crop analyst put overall 1997 rainfall at just below average but said end-April rains were likely to have brought levels back to average.
Another said rains had risen to 145 mm against his 10-year average figure of 134 mm for 12 stations. Rains in some areas had been 35-145 percent above normal.
A dry period in February threatened to cut prospects for the mid-crop but subsequent rains allowed pod forecasters to upgrade forecasts for the period to a range of 160-180,000 tonnes -- compared to 200,000 tonnes last year.
Crop analysts now expect the total 1996/97 cocoa crop to be near last year's record of 1.2 million tonnes. Ivory Coast has not revised its original total crop forecast of 950,000 tonnes.
Latest figures for the 1996/97 main crop, which ended on April 30, have not been released but are expected by exporters and crop analysts to show port arrivals of just over one million tonnes.
This year's mid-crop depends partly on steady rains into June -- when forecasters also begin early assessments of cocoa trees for the 1997/98 main crop.
Latest data from Ivory Coast's national weather station showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of April in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets):
Daloa 21.8 (49.3), Gagnoa 62.7 (63.7), San Pedro 49.4 (47.1), Tabou 95.4 (57.0) Man 12.5 (29.3), Dimbokro 41.8 (22.2), Yamoussoukro 69.0 (107.7), Abidjan 221.2 (156.5), Sassandra 154.7 (39.1), Adiake 51.7 (69.9), Korhogo 9.0 (51.7).

MatthewBunce,"Central African leaders on Thursday welcomed a decision by President Mobutu Sese Seko not to seek reelection, saying it opened a way for a peaceful end to Zaire's civil war and gave its transitional parliament a key role.
Mobutu and the presidents of Gabon, Chad, Congo, Central African Republic and Equatorial Guinea urged the parliament to fill the vacant post of speaker -- Mobutu's constitutional successor in the event of death or incapacity.
""The heads of state of Central Africa took note of the important statement made by President Mobutu Sese Seko, according to which, because of his health problems, he will not stand for reelection,"" a statement issued after a summit in Gabon's capital Libreville said.
This provided ""new prospects for a negotiated political, settlement of the conflict"", it added.
""The heads of state invite Zaire's political forces under the direction of the High Council of the Republic - Transitional Parliament to proceed with the election of its president to allow normal functioning of institutions and favour an orderly and democratic transition,"" the statement said.
Mobutu, who has prostate cancer, met with his fellow leaders during a morning session. The other leaders met without him during much of the afternoon.
Mobutu aides say he will return to Kinshasa by Friday.
Mobutu, 66, has dominated Africa's third largest country for more than three decades. Laurent Kabila and his rebels, who took up arms in October demanding Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis, now control three quarters of the mineral-rich nation.
Kabila has said he will drive Mobutu from Kinshasa if he does not hand power to him before rebel fighters arrive.
Residents say they are around 200 km (125 miles) from the city. A spokesman for South Africa's Nelson Mandela, who brought Mobutu and Kabila together on a South African ship on Sunday, said the rebels appeared to have halted their advance in line with a pledge from Kabila.
In Tanzania, South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said a second meeting between Mobutu and Kabila was set for next Wednesday, adding that the place was uncertain because of Mobutu's health.
In Paris, U.S. special envoy Bill Richardson said a fresh summit was crucial to ensure a peaceful transfer of power.
""I think the probability is high for a second meeting and I'm also encouraged that this second meeting will produce a result that does not involve a violent end, and that includes also an inclusive transitional government,"" he said.
One Zairean opposition newspaper, the Potentiel, dubbed the meeting Mobutu's ""Goodbye summit"" but Zaire's information minister, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, rejected suggestions that his departure for Gabon was a veiled flight into exile.
He said the only thing that would prevent Mobutu from returning immediately would be more talks. ""He is coming back after the summit, unless there is another meeting. There is no reason why the president should flee the country, no reason.""
Mandela promised after Sunday's inconclusive meeting in Congo's port of Pointe Noire that he would bring Kabila and Mobutu back together within 10 days.
Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said South Africa expected the two men's aides would first thrash out a formula ""which we hope will define very clearly the roles of both in the transition process"".
"
MatthewBunce,"Zaire's embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko went into a mini-summit in Gabon with a handful of fellow French-speaking African presidents on Thursday to try to find a peaceful end to the war threatening his capital.
Witnesses said Mobutu, sporting his trademark leopard skin cap, embraced Gabonese president Omar Bongo, another veteran leader who came to power in 1967, two years after Mobutu.
The two walked up a red carpet into the presidential palace to meet the presidents of Chad, Congo, the Central African Republic and former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea. Cameroon, chairing the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), was represented by the foreign minister.
One Zairean opposition newspaper, the Potentiel, dubbed the meeting Mobutu's ""Goodbye summit"".
But Zaire's government, in the person of Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba, rejected suggestions that Mobutu's departure for Gabon was a veiled flight into exile and said the veteran leader would return to his capital after the meeting.
""There's no question of the president fleeing the country,"" he told Radio France International on Thursday.
He said the only thing that would prevent Mobutu from returning immediately would be another meeting. ""He is coming back after the summit, unless there is another meeting. There is no reason why the president should flee the country no reason.""
South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, who brought Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila together on board a South African ship in Congo's port of Pointe Noire on Sunday, said at the time he would organise a fresh meeting within 10 days.
Hundreds of civilians and fighters from both sides were reported dead after a battle for Kenge, a town 200 km (125 miles) east of Kinshasa. Church and humanitarian sources hoped to establish whether massacres had taken place.
Mobutu, 66 and struggling with cancer, has dominated Africa's third largest country for more than three decades.
He has seen his hold over three quarters of the mineral-rich nation broken by Kabila and his rebels, who took up arms in October demanding Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis.
A spokesman in the Gabonese president's office, Vincent Mavungu, said Thursday's mini-summit aimed to find a negotiated settlement after the weekend meeting between Mobutu and Kabila.
""It is therefore normal that consultations take place at all levels to try and find this solution, that is what explains the presence of a certain number of heads of state,"" he said.
One U.N. source said he doubted very much whether there would be another face-to-face meeting between Mobutu and Kabila. ""They (the Central African presidents) will try to get Mobutu to withdraw in a dignified way,"" the source added.
Gabon's Bongo indicated that Mobutu's poor health had prevented the veteran president from meeting other heads of state on Wednesday. ""You know his state of health,"" Bongo said.
The Mobutu-Kabila weekend talks ended inconclusively.
Residents of Kenge, in radio contact with Kinshasa, said the rebels were in control of the town on Wednesday after Mobutu's forces recaptured it briefly on Sunday night. They said at least 200 civilians, 106 government soldiers and 15 rebels were killed.
Kinshasa was reported calm on Thursday but residents of the city of five million people remain apprehensive -- a mood reflected in the capital's newspapers.
The independent Reference Plus quoted Mobutu's security adviser Honore Ngbanda as saying the city was a powderkeg and any fire lit there could be very difficult to put out.
"
MatthewBunce,"Ivorian coffee exporters are busy grading a large crop and will pay little attention to next week's meeting of Association of Coffee Producing Countries, when world export plans will be reviewed, exporters said.
""Forget it. It means nothing,"" said one on Tuesday. ""The (current retention) quantity is not shocking and we do not expect anything new but it might hit sentiment.""
Green robusta coffee arrivals at Ivorian ports totalled around 250,000 tonnes by May 9 in the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) season against just over 180,000 by the same time last year, they said.
African producers agreed in January to cut robusta exports (Jan-June) from 6.52 million (60-kg) bags to 5.67 million under an ACPC export plan but the amount to be retained by each country was unclear.
Ivory Coast agreed to subtract 15,000 tonnes from its share of a previously agreed African quota totalling 6.52 million bags (Jan-June). Its share of the existing quota was not published.
Ivorian coffee exports and local industry offtake since the start of the season were about 110,000-120,000 tonnes to date, leaving export warehouse stocks of just over that amount.
""Those stocks have nothing to do with the (ACPC) plan, said one. ""That (stock) takes into account Nestle (Ivory Coast's main roaster) buying 30,000 tonnes for this year,"" said one source. ""Jean-Abile Gal (a smaller roaster) has also bought 5,000 to 10,000 for blending with imported arabica.""
Ivorian exporters expect a steady flow of shipments up to the end of the season despite roller-coaster world prices which this week hit a year high of $1,835 tonne basis July.
Robusta prices have risen 51 percent since January after late 1996 lows which prompted African countries to press the ACPC for an export limit plan to propel flagging robusta prices closer to higher Arabicas, which have doubled since January. Analysts have said the rises were more due to production fundamentals and uncertainty stemming from Just-In-time inventory policies adopted by roasters, rather than export retention.
Ivorian coffee exporters say the (Jan-June) ACPC plan was irrelevant for Ivory Coast given that coffee grading capacity only allows about 20,000 tonnes to be processed a week. That meant stocks would have built up without the plan with little chance of exceeding quotas.
Stocks might be carried into 1997/98 depending on late-season world prices, they added. However, shipments could pick up in July. U.S. analysts cited a robusta coffee supply squeeze ahead of end-season shipments for a robusta price spike basis July.
""It depends on the exporters' books,"" said one forwarder.
If the price trend continued, warehouses would empty out despite rising exports from non-ACPC Asian producers, said another. ""Ivory Coast usually exports between 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes a year. If late-season prices are good all the coffee might leave,"" he said.
Arrivals totalled about 12,000 tonnes last week, said one exporter. Quantities remaining upcountry were not clear but villagers were still holding stocks back for better prices from buyers, he added.
""When prices are low up to 50,000 tonnes of coffee can be carried over between seasons. Not of all of this year's crop will necessarily be exported,"" he added.
Ivory Coast has produced a better-than-expected 1996/97 crop, seen reaching anything up to 300,000 tonnes by the season's end against 180,000 last year. It has forecast 230,000 tonnes for this year but arrivals totalled that amount by the end of April -- with five months of the season remaining.

MatthewBunce,"French chocolate group CEMOI is building a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast which will open in October 1997, the company's managing director said on Wednesday.
""The factory can process 60,000 tonnes of beans a year,"" Managing Director Patrique Poivrier told Reuters by telephone from CEMOI's headquarters at Perpignan, in the south of France. He put the cost of the project at 160 million French francs.
Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop locally by the year 2000 to add export value and remove lower quality late season (May-Sept), or mid-crop, beans from international markets.
CEMOI's factory would open at its full capacity but could be upgraded to 120,000 tonnes after two years, producing cocoa liquor and cocoa cake and butter, Poivrier said. Work began at the construction site in northern Abidjan (Yopougon) on Friday, he added.
CEMOI, one of Europe's largest chocolate confectioners, uses 40,000 tonnes of raw cocoa beans a year and would sell products from the extra 20,000 tonnes capacity mainly to Europe and perhaps China.
""We are also looking at markets in China,"" he said.
Poivrier said the factory had been planned to secure a regular supply of good quality cocoa and by-pass Ivorian commodity exporters.
Ivory Coast already has three cocoa processing factories with capacity for processing up to 160,000 tonnes of beans a year.
Europe's Callebaut Barry group owns two factories. Ivorian exporter SIFCA owns a third, with some share participation from U.S.-based Arthur Daniels Midland. It plans to expand capacity by 21,000 tonnes by 1998.
Several other factory projects are nearing final planning stages.
U.S.-based Cargill will soon reach a decision on whether to go ahead with plans to build a 60,000 tonnes-capacity factory in partnership with Ivorian exporter SICC.
""There should be a decision in June,"" said a source close to the negotiations.

MatthewBunce,"Heavy wet season rains in April favouring Ivorian cocoa midcrop growth (May-Sept) dropped off in early May but harvests are expected to match forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes, weather and crop analysts said on Thursday.
""Nothing much has really changed,"" said one crop analyst returning from upcountry and referring to favourable pod growth and flowering seen in early April. ""The development seems to be coming along quite nicely.""
Official weather data for the first 10 days of May totalled 292.6 mm against 789.2 mm in the previous 10 days.
Wet season rains, which arrived in April, are expected to peak in June before small dry season conditions in July and August.
Steady June rains would favour pod growth and bean sizes and help propel harvest volumes toward preliminary crop analyst mid-crop forecasts of between 150,000-200,000 tonnes.
""I would have hoped for a bit more soil moisture,"" said one crop analyst. Another said levels were around average for the time of year.
Early May rains were concentrated north of main cocoa growing areas, with a total of 338 mm falling around Odienne, Bouake and Bondoukrou, and are not included in the above data.
Ivory Coast produced a bumper 200,000 tonnes mid-crop in its record 1.2 million tonnes harvest year (Oct-Sept). This year's main crop (Oct-April) was close to one million tonnes when the season closed at the end of last month.
The latest data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of May in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed):
Daloa 44.4 (21.8), Gagnoa 12.0 (62.7), San Pedro 1.3 (49.4), Tabou 60.5 (95.4) Man 33.3 (12.5), Dimbokro 39.7 (41.8), Yamoussoukro 34.6 (69.0), Abidjan 35.1 (221.2), Sassandra 0 (154.7), Adiake 27.1 (51.7), Korhogo 4.6 (9.0).

MatthewBunce,"Ivory Coast's cocoa mid-crop (May-Sept) could match harvest forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes but bean sizes are seen down from the record 1995/96 season (Oct-Sept), crop analysts and exporters said on Thursday.
""The development seems to be coming along quite nicely,"" said one. ""It is still early but I see no reason to suspect the mid-crop will be poor.""
Good peak wet season rains in June would decide the final mid-crop tally but this year's bean sizes are not expected to match the mainly exportable grades (105 beans per 100 grammes) seen in the record 1.2 million tonnes (total crop) 1995/96 year.
""Last year's mid-crop (200,000 tonnes) was exceptional. I think the sizes will return to more normal levels,"" said another crop analyst, pointing to a range of 110-120 range with lowest grades possibly touching 150.
Ivory Coast's main crop reached around one million tonnes by the season's closing date of April 27. Crop analysts expect the mid-crop to be down on 1995/96 with some early forecasts in a 160-180,000 tonnes range.
Crop analysts said said plantation soil moiture levels had dropped in some areas after heavy wet season rains in April eased off in the first ten days of May.
""There was less moisture than I thought there would be, but it is not a problem,"" said one.
Bean sizes would swell if June rains were sufficient.
""I do not have a pessimistic view of mid-crop,"" said the analyst. ""As far as I am concerned soil humidity is average but our teams have not yet completed their tour.""
Crop analysts returning from upcountry farm inspections reported little harvesting and drying of cocoa. They did not expect mid-crop arrivals at port to strenghten until June -- after a lull in activity between the main and mid-crops.
""What is there will sit around for mixing in with better beans and larger quantities. It is just not worth the farmers selling yet,"" said one.
Exporters say late main crop and a trickle of mid-crop beans arriving at ports are in a 105-110 range.
""Last year, even the tail of the mid-crop met export standards,"" said one. Special contracts for grades outside the official export standard would still be exported.
""Discounts will be applied, as for poor coffee beans, but it will all be exported,"" he added.
Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa crop by the year 2,000, partly to remove poorer grades from export markets, but also to push up world prices while adding export value.
Local processors, with three factories, have a total bean processing capacity of around 160,000 tonnes.
That figure could rise to at least 209,000 tonnes in 1996/97 as local factories build extensions and possible oil-palm factory capacity for cocoa bean processing comes on line.
Other factories already under construction or in final planning stages could take Ivorian bean processing capacity to over 350,000 tonnes by 1998/99 (Corrects from 1997/98) -- without taking into account a raft of plans in early discussion stages.

MatthewBunce,"Port arrivals of 1996/97 Ivorian cocoa totalled around 1.02-03 million tonnes by May 12, down from 1.11 million by that date in the record 1995/96 year, port sources said on Tuesday.
Weekly arrivals at Abidjan and Ivory Coast's second port, San Pedro, dropped sharply to 5,000 tonnes in the week to May 12 from about 50,000 during the final week of the main crop (Oct-April), raising concern that the size of the May-September mid-crop would be disappointing.
""The mid-crop has been weak so far but we are still optimistic,"" said one Abidjan-based crop analyst. ""Some people thought it was going to be a bit late but we are optimistic as July and August will be the most important time (for arrivals).""
Ivory Coast's main crop totalled around 1.04 million tonnes by its April 27 close, against about 1.06 million tonnes in 1995/96 when a larger than expected mid-crop of just under 200,000 tonnes took that year's total to a record of around 1.2 million tonnes.
Early forecasts of Ivory Coast's 1996/97 crop proved to be cautious as arrivals by the end of the main crop had exceeded Ivory Coast's official full-year (Oct-Sept) forecast of up to 950,000 tonnes.
The 1996/97 crop is not expected by local crop analysts to set a new record but it will not be far behind if early private mid-crop forecasts of 150-180,000 tonnes prove to be correct.
""We are still fairly optimistic. Our figure is at the higher end of that range but we may cut by just a little,"" said the crop analyst.
Other crop analysts said recent talk of a mid-crop as small as 80,000 tones had been based on weak May and early June arrivals and signs of poor bean quality and sizes.
""What was around was small but I think it (bean quality) has improved,"" said one analyst. ""It should now be possible to get beans of 105 to 110 (beans per 100 grams).""
Ivory Coast's export grade standard of 105 beans per 100 grams sometimes eludes exporters during the mid-crop, when bean sizes usually decline along with harvest volumes. Exporters last year were surprised by high bean quality well into the mid-crop period.
Export quality inspectors have reported bean sizes in a 105-110 range with little evidence of humidity problems.
Torrential rains since mid-May have not raised bean humidity levels above the eight percent permitted for export grades. Farmers had problems drying main crop beans during heavy December rains, leading to some quality problems at port.
Crop analysts also report favourable signs for next year's 1997/98 main cocoa crop, but add that no reliable indication for the first half of that year would appear on trees until late July.
""We are only looking at the very beginning and it looks fairly good,"" said one. ""Nothing untoward has happened and rumours of a disastrous crop are probably wishful thinking. No one is yet in a position to know.""

MatthewBunce,"The El Nino weather pattern developing in the Pacific could damage West African cocoa crops, but the extent of any losses is hard to predict because of local weather and crop patterns, industry analysts said on Thursday.
""Sometimes it has effects on yields and sometimes it doesn't,"" said one crop analyst, referring to seven other El Nino events since one of the most damaging in 1976.
On Tuesday the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said weather in the Pacific had triggered an El Nino weather pattern that would probably affect world crops.
Cocoa futures for July contracts spiked at a new high of 1,085 stg a tonne in London trading on Thursday but long-term price effects would depend on traders' views on supply deficits into 1997/98 (Oct/Sept).
El Nino is the name given to a reversal of ocean water circulation in the southern Pacific. The phenomenon, which scientists say is becoming more common, is generally associated with droughts in parts of Africa, Australia, Indonesia and South America.
In more northerly countries, El Ninos can spell rain.
El Nino cut Nigerian 1976/77 cocoa production from a possible 220,000 tonnes to around 160,000 tonnes, with Ghana's crop cut to around 330,000 tonnes from 412,000, say analysts.
""El Nino can cause enormous havoc. Depending on when it hits it can affect one or two years' main crop,"" one analyst told Reuters in Abidjan.
Ivory Coast was largely unaffected in 1976/77 as widespread tree plantings offset El Nino damage, leaving a stable crop trend.
A second wave of prolonged El Nino damage arose between 1982 and 1984, when bush fires caused by abnormally dry weather swept through Ivorian plantations.
""In 1992/93 yields were good so prices were not seriously affected,"" said one analyst. Collapsing Eastern European consumption after the fall of the Berlin Wall coupled with plentiful world stocks had dampened supply fears, he added.
""Now there is a deficit forecast and consumption is again expanding in Asia,"" he said.
UK-based trader ED &amp; F Man in its May report said, ""Unless the weather in West Africa improves, the cocoa market faces a substantial drawdown in stocks in 1997/98"".
Man forecasts a supply deficit of 125-150,000 tonnes by the end of the 1996/97 season and a 34 percent rise in world grindings to 2,795,000 tonnes.
Other analysts say it is too early to guess the effects of the El Nino.
""If the El Nino develops and hits in late 1997 there will be no effect on the cocoa. The main crop (Oct-April) will already be on the trees,"" one said. ""(It) would only affect next year's mid-crop (May-Sept).""
One crop analyst said scant rains in the 1993/94 crop year (Oct-Sept) resulted from El Nino weather but failed to damage crops because thick cloud cover over West Africa prevented a drop in soil moisture.
Heavy rains have fallen throughout Ivory Coast over the past three weeks.
""People have not got terribly excited about it in the past,"" he added, referring to the effects of the previous El Nino reported in 1994. ""Futures may now be rising as people take on insurance cover but that stock can easily be dumped back into the market later if necessary.""

MatthewBunce,"Plans to build cocoa factories in Ivory Coast will take national processing capacity to 360,000 tonnes in 1997/98 (Oct-Sept), in line with a target of 500,000 tonnes by 2000, Ivory Coast's commodities minister said on Friday.
""If you take into account Cargill, Touton, Cemoi, STF-CI, Orebi and Shanghai we will reach 360,000 tonnes in 1997/98,"" commodities minister Guy-Alain Gauze told Reuters on Friday, referring to chocolate processors' plans to build factories.
Gauze was speaking after a meeting on Friday with the world chocolate trade body OICCC (Office International du Cacao, du Chocolat et de la Confiserie) on cocoa quality and supply.
Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa exporter and aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop buy the year 2000. It produced a record 1.2 million tonned in 1995/96 and is set to harvest over 1.1 million tonnes in 1996/97
""Callebaut-Barry will raise its capacity to 100,000 tonnes from 90,000 tonnes this year, so by the year 2000 we will reach 500,000,"" Gauze added.
Callebaut-Barry already owns two factories in Ivory Coast and accounts for over a half of Ivorian annual processing capacity, which is set to rise to at least 180,000 by 1998.
Cocoa accounts for 40 percent of Ivorian export earnings but the government aims to diversify the country's economy away from agriculture by encouraging commodities processing, mining and energy sectors.
The OICCC was in Ivory Coast for the first of what it plans to be regular talks with the government on cococa issues, including bean quality and security of supplies.
OICCC spokesman Tom Harison told reporters afterwards that he welcomed Ivorian plans to raise cocoa processing capacity to 500,000 tonnes, or 50 percent of annual harvests, by the year 2000 as healthy competition for European grinders.
Other delegates were more sceptical.
""The question is how much the Ivorian farmer will have to give up to pay for it,"" said one, referring to tax and subsidy sweeteners to investors for building new factories.
The OICCC sees world demand growing at three percent in 1997/98 and sees ""immense potential for extra (chocolate) demand in Eastern Europe and Asia.""
""We believe in this. We have put our money in (to factories),"" said Harrison, adding that Ivory Coast was well placed as a supplier to benefit from stabilising or declining cocoa production in other major producing countries, such as Brazil and Indonesia.
But he pointed to an ageing population in Europe, health concerns over chocolate and stricter advertising rules which he said threatened future demand in some regions.
""People are having fewer children, and children are big consumers,"" he added. ""We are spending a lot of money to protect ourselves.""
He said producer country concerns over use of up to five percent non-cocoa fat in chocolate in Europe was a minor issue next to public perception of chocolate as a ""product which makes you fat and makes your teeth fall out.""
Gauze has fought European plans to allow non-cocoa fat usage, putting resulting demand for beans at between 60,000 tonnes and 200,000 tonnes.
Ivory Coast fears a fall in cocoa usage would hit its bean and processed product exports -- a view not shared by some chocolate manufacturers in Europe and the United States.
""Future demand for chocolate is goind to come in a wider and wider range of products,"" he added, saying that the OICCC did not have a common position on use of non-cocoa fats.
Overall cocoa consumption was rising despite use of synthetic and vegetable substitutes for cocoa fats, he added.

MatthewBunce,"A world chocolate industry group meeting Ivorian officals to discuss cocoa quality and supply will meet donors in Washington on Monday to discuss effects of market reforms on bean quality, a spokesman said Friday.
""We know that where there has been liberalisation in the past there has been a drop in quality,"" said a spokesman for the world industry forum OICCC (Office International du Cacao, du Chocolat et de la Confiserie).
OICCC officials would meet World Bank officials in Washington on Monday, he said.
""You must protect quality and you must protect the forward market,"" OICCC spokesman Tom Harrison told Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze at a meeting with journalists after separate talks with donors and ministers on Friday.
The talks on Friday between OICCC representatives, Ivorian agriculture and commodities ministers and industry delegates, were held against a background of stricter food legislation worldwide and rising demand for quality chocolate in some countries.
World supply has also fallen or stabilised in other producer countries, including Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia, leaving chocolate manufacturers more dependent on Ivorian production.
""Legislators and consumers are putting pressure on us,"" said one delegate. ""There are a lot of factories going up in Eastern Europe and Asia and we cannot afford hiccoughs.""
Ivory Coast has closed upcountry cocoa checking stations and liberalised cocoa marketing since 1995 under the terms of a $150 million World Bank farm sector loan.
Industry buyers say cocoa bean quality has dropped as a result. Donors reject the idea and say only a complete liberalisation of marketing prices will provide farmers with enough incentive to improve husbandry.
Ivory Coast also put in place a cocoa export contract auction system but there have been concerns that rules encourage exporters to overbid to win contracts, creating a parallel price above terminal market levels.
""We have particular problems in blending good cocoa with poor cocoa... particularly since the Caisse (state marketing board) stopped upcountry quality checks,"" said Harrison.
Exporters say poor and good quality beans are often mixed together to meet Ivory Coast's export grade standard of 105 beans per 100 grammes with under 10 percent humidity.
Harrison also called for Ivory Coast to produce more of the high-quality beans that could be used to give chocolate its cocoa flavour.
""We do use some Ivorian beans in our flavour element (for chocolate) but we have to be highly selective,"" he said. ""To make high quality chocolate we need beans with no off-odours,"" said Harrison.
""Only one country produces the beans which give us the flavour element in our chocolate and that is Ghana,"" he added.
The size of Ghana's crop is between a third and a quarter of Ivory Coast's annual crop, which in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) hit a record 1.2 million tonnes.
It has kept upcountry checks in place and this week said it would not go ahead with donor-sponsored liberalisation of internal marketing.
Ghanaian cocoa usually attracts a $30 dollars a tonne premium over other origins, including Ivory Coast.
Ivory Coast and the World Bank held discussions in May on further cocoa sector liberalisation but disagreed on policies to increase competitiveness while maintaining quality.

But he told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that ""we will listen and explore all reasonable measures.""
He also said Philip Morris was willing to work with government officials to hammer out new regulations on tobacco sales, even as the industry fights a court battle against tough new restrictions on sales, especially to minors, put in place by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year.
""We are willing to work with responsible government representatives and others on a balanced system,"" Bible said.
He did not spell out what initiatives he might consider, other than to say Philip Morris favoured restrictions on young people buying cigarettes and two years ago launched a programme to limit people under 21 from obtaining cigarettes.
""We do not want kids to smoke,"" Bible said.
Anti-smoking groups have said the industry targets its advertising to encourage young people to smoke.
At the meeting, Philip Morris shareholders rejected a shareholder proposal that the company adopt the same standards on marketing to youths outside the United States that it put in place domestically two years ago.
Bible also said Philip Morris would continue fighting the of hundreds of individual, state and class-action suits it faces ""vigorously.""
Tobacco executives have met for the first time in recent weeks with state officials and anti-smoking activists on possibly settling the massive litigation against the industry.
Negotiators said on Wednesday they had met on Sunday and Monday in Chicago but reported that no deal was imminent, a White House official said after negotiators from both sides briefed White House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey.
Published reports have said the industry might pay as much as $300 billion over 25 years into a compensation fund for smokers who fall sick with lung cancer and other diseases. In return, cigarette makers would get broad shelter from lawsuits and would likely see higher stock market valuations on their tobacco and non-smoking businesses.

MichaelConnor,"Philip Morris Cos Inc shareholders on Thursday voted down by a margin of more than nine to one a shareholder proposal that the firm adopt the same standards on marketing to youths outside the United States that it put in place domestically two years ago.
The proposal to extend the limitations to overseas markets was opposed by Philip Morris chief executive Geoffrey Bible and the board of directors.  
""It's absolutely hypocritical for Mr Bible to hail the company's youth access program at home ... and at the same time not apply the same standard anywhere else,"" said shareholder Edward Sweda, an anti-tobacco activist and a lawyer with the Tobacco Control Resource Center in Boston.
Philip Morris' U.S. program -- Action Against Access -- eliminated mail sales of Marlboro, L&amp;M and other Philip Morris cigarettes and give-aways of cigarettes at public gatherings.  
The company also added warnings against youth sales to its cigarette packs and began lobbying for state laws to force shopkeepers to check for proof of age, Philip Morris spokeswoman Karen Daragan said.
""The intent (of the U.S. program) is to keep sales to places were IDs can be checked,"" she said.
But shareholder activists noted that this action was limited to the United States and the shareholder proposal cited data showing how effective Philip Morris cigarette advertising was outside the United States.  
It quoted one study saying 95 percent of children in Hong Kong recognized the Marlboro brand name and a World Health Organization forecast that seven million youths who take up smoking in the developing world will die from smoking-related diseases by 2025.
Bible did not speak directly to the proposal at the meeting but Philip Morris said in the company's proxy for the annual meeting that the company has long opposed sales of cigarettes to young people and a single style of marketing was wrong for a global company selling food, beer and tobacco products in 180 nations.
""Your management thinks it makes more sense for the company to continue to take action against youth access in a manner that recognizes the diversity of markets in which the company operates,"" the company said.
Top tobacco companies are secretly bargaining with anti-tobacco forces on a $300 billion or more deal to resolve much U.S. tobacco litigation and likely sharply reduce the marketing of cigarettes in the United States.

MichaelConnor,"General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jack Welch defended his $28.2 million in salary, bonuses and incentives for 1996, telling shareholders Wednesday that market forces determined pay packages for top U.S. executives.
""The issue is the competitive marketplace,"" he told a critic at GE's annual meeting. ""The market is willing to play at a certain level ...""
Stockholders at the meeting defeated a proposal to limit Welch's pay to $1 million unless put to a shareholder vote.
The proposal to limit Welch's pay received 9 percent of the votes cast, with 91 percent backing Welch's existing compensation arrangements.
Bill Patterson of the AFL-CIO group of labor unions, a supporter of the effort to put a cap on Welch's paycheck, said Welch's compensation was 148 times more than that paid on average to GE's 239,000 employees.
The proposal was made by a Teamsters union pension fund.
Patterson said the pay, even with Welch's highly acclaimed management successes and the stellar stock market performance of GE's shares since he became chief executive 16 years ago, was a source of bitterness and cynicism for many GE workers.
Welch said he was well paid and was benefitting from the labor of all GE's employees. He noted that stock options were now distributed to some 22,000 GE employees, as opposed to only 200 as recently as 1988.
Big pay packages, including deferred compensation plans, were needed to retain top performers, Welch said. He said some top GE executives, such as the current head of AlliedSignal Inc. had left the company for more pay and broader opportunities.
Welch, the latest U.S. chief executive to be criticized for high compensation, last year received $6.3 million in salary, $15.1 million from a long-term incentive program and $6.2 million by excercising options on GE stock.
He was also paid almost $600,000 in benefits, such as life insurance, according to GE's proxy statement.
Walt Disney Co. stockholders, including several leading institutional investors, two months ago challenged a 10-year pay package given Chairman Michael Eisner worth as much as $771 million. Twelve percent of Disney shares were voted against the Eisner pay package.
One study said CEO pay rose about 20 percent in 1996 and 16 percent in 1995.

At least one model who appeared as the Marlboro Man in advertising campaigns around the world has died of smoking-related illness.
The proposal to extend the company's limitations on domestic marketing to foreign markets was opposed by Philip Morris chief executive Geoffrey Bible and the board of directors.
The company said it has long opposed sales of cigarettes to young people but that a single style of marketing was wrong for a global company selling food, beer and tobacco products in 180 nations.
""It's absolutely hypocritical for Mr. Bible to hail the company's youth access programme at home ... and at the same time not apply the same standard anywhere else,"" said shareholder Edward Sweda, an anti-tobacco activist and a lawyer with Tobacco Control Resource Centre in Boston.
Philip Morris's U.S. programme, launched two years ago and called Action Against Access, eliminated mail sales of Marlboro, L&amp;M and other Philip Morris cigarettes and give-aways of cigarettes at public gatherings.
The company also added warnings against youth sales to its cigarette packs and began lobbying for state laws to force shopkeepers to check for proof of age, Philip Morris spokeswoman Karen Daragan said.
Top tobacco companies are privately negotiating with anti-tobacco forces on a $300 billion or more deal to resolve much U.S. tobacco litigation and likely sharply reduce the marketing of cigarettes in the United States.

MichaelConnor,"Quickly expanding Republic Industries should meet full-year 1997 share-profit estimates of $0.70, Republic chief financial officer Mike Karsher said on Monday.
All four Republic segments, including car retailing, performed well in the first quarter and the diversified services group expects to accelerate the pace of openings of its AutoNation used-car superstores in 1997, Karsher told Reuters.  
But Karsher cautioned the four or five new superstores being added to the 1997 schedule would not add to 1997 full-year profits since the outlets typically incur initial losses until sales volume picks up.
Republic is on an acquisition campaign. In the past six months it bought major car-rental agencies such as Alamo and car dealerships in many parts of the United States.
For the first quarter, Republic reported a doubling of share profits to $0.08 from the same period in 1996.
Karsher said the share profits were $0.01 higher than a consensus of Wall Street analysts forecasts.  
Net income grew even faster to $28.9 million from $12.4 million as revenues rose to $1.504 billion from $1.016 billion.
The company has greatly expanded its share base with its stock-swap acquistions and had average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 374 million, up from 283 million a year earlier.
""All four business segments had very good quarters,"" he said.
Republic has opened three AutoNation stores so far in 1997 and had planned to open 10 more this year, but was adding four or five stores.
""We are pleased with the performance of the AutoNation stores,"" he said.
Beyond auto sales and rentals, Republic sells security services and operates waste haulage businesses.

MichaelConnor,"Republic Industries, Inc., expanding its nationwide car dealership network, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire two more companies in Florida for a total of $62 million in stock.
The dealerships are Gulf Management Inc., which operates Lexus of Tampa Bay and Lexus of Clearwater, Fla.; and the Steve Moore General Motors automotive group of Palm Beach, Fla., which includes Chevrolet, Cadillac, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Geo brands.
The deals include all related real estate, and are subject to manufacturer and government approval.
The dealerships' owners will retain their responsibilities under long-term employment agreements, Republic said.
Republic, led by Florida billionaire Wayne Huizenga, owns the nation's largest chain of new vehicle dealerships and is building a chain of used car megastores it operates under the AutoNation USA brand name.
Republic also owns National Car Rental System Inc., Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. and has agreed to acquire Spirit Rent-A-Car.
Until last summer, Republic had mainly been a waste management company. Its aggressive strategy of creating a nationwide auto dealership network has sparked lawsuits by Japanese motor giants Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. to block Republic's plan to acquire their outlets in major U.S. markets.
Each company wants AutoNation to stop buying retailers which sell its cars. In its suit filed last week, Honda said AutoNation was cheapening its Honda and Acura brands.
Both companies limit the number of dealerships which can be owned by one propietor and have said AutoNation wants to control 20 percent of their U.S. sales.
Huizenga this week shrugged off the lawsuits, saying that AutoNation never aspired to control one of every five Toyota and Honda sales in the United States.
""We never said 20 percent and we never expected to get that much,"" Huizenga told the annual shareholders meeting of Republic on Tuesday. ""We know we will be partners with them.""
Huizenga, credited with creating giant video-retailer Blockbuster and Waste Management Corp., said AutoNation can take minority stakes in Toyota and Honda dealerships or use other techniques for tapping into the strong sales flows of highly popular Toyota and Honda vehicles.
""There are ways to accomplish what we want,"" Huizenga said. Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Republic's stock was off 94 cents at $27.375 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading.

MichaelConnor,"U.S. billionaire Wayne Huizenga shrugged off lawsuits filed by two Japanese motor giants, saying on Tuesday that the AutoNation car-retailing arm of his Republic Industries Inc never aspired to control one of every five Toyota and Honda sales in the United States.
Both Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd have filed suits in U.S. courts against AutoNation, one of several buyout companies prowling the tens of thousands of independent car retailers in the United States.
Each company wants AutoNation to stop buying retailers which sell its cars. In its suit filed last week, Honda said AutoNation was cheapening its Honda and Acura brands.
Both companies limit the number of dealerships which can be owned by one proprietor and have said AutoNation wants to control 20 percent of their U.S. sales.
""We never said 20 percent and we never expected to get that much,"" Huizenga told the annual shareholders meeting of Republic. ""We know we will be partners with them.""
A renowned businessman credited with creating giant video-retailer Blockbuster and Waste Management Corp, Huizenga said AutoNation could take minority stakes in Toyota and Honda dealerships or use other techniques for tapping into the strong sales flows of highly popular Toyota and Honda vehicles.
""There are ways to accomplish what we want,"" Huizenga said.
Huizenga is chairman and co-chief executive of Republic, an auto-services, home-security and garbage-hauling conglomerate which has bought dozens of small car dealerships and other businesses in the past 18 months using Republic's high-flying shares in stock-swaps.
But Republic's shares are 25 percent or more off their highs, at least in part to investors worries that rivals are beginning to narrow AutoNation's lead in consolidating used and new car dealerships.
Ford Motor Co executives last week briefed dealers in Indianopolis, Indiana, on a voluntary and highly innovative plan to gather together about 18 Indianapolis-area Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships into five or six giant sales outlets with stand-alone, satellite service facilities for light repairs and warranty work.
The giant centres, similar to the 11 AutoNation superstores now operating, would be owned by Ford and by participating dealers, a Ford spokesman has said.
Ford is looking to test the concept in two or three medium-sized markets in the next two to three years with an eye to a possible public offering.
""We welcome that,"" Republic president Steve Berrard said. ""We think it's a great endorsement.""
Besides AutoNation, Circuit City Stores Inc.'s CarMax and others are using many of the customer-friendly techniques pioneered by General Motors Corp's Saturn unit to court the two of every three Americans who hate to haggle.
Both GM and Chrysler Corp have had programmes to reduce their dealership ranks through consolidation and buy-outs, but neither has proposed as radical a restructuring of its distribution system.

MichaelConnor,"Sterling Software Inc's $165 million purchase of Texas Instruments Inc software unit will close on June 14 and will help Sterling's financials almost immediately, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday.  
""Three or four minutes,"" Sterling Williams told Reuters when asked how long Sterling Software would spend integrating Texas Instrument's 1,300 staff and 62 facilities around the world. ""It will enhance both profits and revenues almost immediately,"" Williams said.
Williams also said Sterling Software's cash holdings, enlarged greatly by last fall's spinoff of Sterling Commerce Inc, remain largely intact after the Texas Instruments' deal and will be used to pay for more acquisitions.  
Founded in 1981 and with more than two dozen acquisitions to its credit, the company will have some $600 million in cash after the Texas Instruments' check is written, Williams said.
""The biggest opportunities out there are in applications software,"" Williams said. ""Size doesn't attract or repel us.""  
Applications software groups, such as the Texas Instruments' business Sterling is buying, help design new software for big organizations and cobble together different computer systems.
Sterling is also interested in companies which produce software for big computer systems, Williams said.  
The Texas Instruments' acquisition announced a month ago will add $250 million in annual revenues to Sterling Software and better than double to half the portion of Sterling Software revenues which come from applications software operations, Williams said.
Sterling had fiscal 1996 revenues of about $440 million.  
Williams said Sterling Software's top executives had spent the past month meeting TI Software's managers around the world and had clear, detailed plans for weaving the unit into Sterling.
He said cost savings would come through cuts in research and administration and that layoffs would likely be minimal. The combined sales forces would allow broader marketing of Sterling Software's products and services, he said.
""Our ramp up basically takes place before the announcement,"" he said. ""But there is a settling-in phase where you make course corrections.""  
The combination would stimulate sales growth in Sterling's applications operations, which had been flat in fiscal 1996 after fast growth in the early 1990s, Williams said.
He declined to discuss detailed forecasts.
TI's customers will be largely new ones for Sterling and acceptance of the deal among customers seems to be good, Williams said.
""Not a single customer called and said he was worried,"" he said.
Sterling Software shares rose 5/8  and closed at 32-1/4.

MichaelConnor,"Any sweeping settlement among state governments and tobacco companies would leave standing a great many anti-smoking suits, including a $5 billion claim scheduled for a June 2 trial, plaintiff lawyers said on Friday.
""It's a lousy settlement for my clients and the American people,"" said Stanley Rosenblatt, one of two lawyers pressing the Broin class-action suit here on behalf of flight attendants claiming injuries from secondhand tobacco smoke.  
Rosenblatt's case goes to trial on June 2 and is a landmark, because it is both the first class-action suit against cigarette makers to survive preliminary legal challenges and the first trial of a claim of damage from second-hand smoke.
Some 1,000 anti-tobacco lawsuits currently exist in U.S. courts against tobacco companies, according to Richard Daynard of the Tobacco Products Litigation Project at Northeastern University.  
Norwood Wilner, another Florida attorney who secured a $750,000 jury judgment against the Brown &amp; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries Plc in 1996, has no plans to delay his next trial, said his legal aide, Jenny Stieger.
""We have a trial date of August 4, for another lady with lung cancer,"" Stieger said.
Wilner on May 5 lost a suit on behalf of smoker Jean Connor, who was killed by lung cancer, against RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.  
Reynolds, the maker of Winston and Salem brand cigarettes, will also be the defendant in the August trial on the claim of Joann Karbinyk, Stieger said.
Another anti-tobacco lawyer, Ronald Acosta, has two tentative trial dates scheduled for summer in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida. Wilner expects to try still another case in November, Stieger said.  
Other cases expected to come to trial in 1997 include another class-action on behalf of Florida smokers in September and a secondhand smoke case in Mississippi brought by the family of a non-smoking barber who allegedly died of cancer caused by the cigarette smokers awaiting haircuts in his shop.
According to published reports, in part challenged by Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, tobacco companies and the 29 state governments suing the industry for billions in healthcare spending on smokers are near a deal limiting the number and type of lawsuits which could be brought by smokers.  
The Wall Street Journal said the proposed terms would make it nearly impossible for future smokers to sue cigarette makers for lung cancer and other common tobacco-related illnesses. ""The global settlement is not a done deal,"" said Stieger. ""There is not a whole lot of support for a deal messing with the tort system.""
Attorney Rosenblatt said during a pre-trial hearing for the Broin class-action suit that the tobacco industry and the attorneys general would reach a settlement.  Tobacco lawyers would then go to ""a friendly court"" and ask it to halt the Broin trial.  
""I don't think that's going to be successful, but that's the plan,"" he said.
Michael Russ, a lawyer for Brown &amp; Williamson, told Reuters as the hearing broke for lunch: ""If that is the plan, I don't know about it.""

MichaelConnor,"Cigarette companies will face one of their biggest legal challenges in four decades Monday when the first ever class-action anti-smoking case goes to trial in a Florida court.
""This is the first of the big ones,"" Richard Daynard, an anti-smoking activist who heads the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University in Boston, said of the case, known as Broin vs. Philip Morris Co., et al.
In addition to being the first class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry, the case is also being watched very closely because the plaintiffs -- 60,000 airline flight attendants -- are not themselves smokers.
That fact will prevent the cigarette companies from using one of their traditional defences -- that smokers are aware of the possible health risks of smoking and voluntarily chose to smoke.
The $5 billion Broin case was brought by airline flight attendants who claim their lung cancer and other tobacco-related illnesses were caused by passengers' cigarette smoke. Smoking was banned on U.S. airliners in 1988.
""One of the most successful defences for tobacco companies is that the smokers knew of the risks,"" said Professor Michael Zimmer of the Seton Hall School of Law in New Jersey. ""In secondhand smoke, you don't have that.""
Lawyers said the ranks of tobacco attorneys representing the 10 companies named in the lawsuit will challenge and probe the testimony of experts called by Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, the Miami husband-and-wife attorney team pressing the Broin lawsuit. The case is named for Norma Broin, 42 and suffering lung cancer.
Among the witnesses for the flight attendants will be two former U.S. surgeon generals and physicians and scientists drawing on a decade or more of research on secondhand smoke, Stanley Rosenblatt said.
A Harvard University study published last week which found a strong link between heart disease and secondhand smoke is a boon for the flight attendants, Rosenblatt and other attorneys said.
A lawyer for Philip Morris declined to discuss the details of the case, other than to say the tobacco companies expected to prevail.
Zimmer said the Rosenblatt's case may be weakened by the two-stage trial structure, since little of the individual suffering and pain will be telegraphed to the jurors as the attorneys battle over statistics and scientific methodology.
""In class-action suits, juries want a human element and the plaintiffs won't have that,"" Zimmer said.
""A loss in Broin would make the companies ever more desperate,"" said Daynard, a pioneer in promoting lawsuits against cigarette companies.
Other multibillion-dollar lawsuits by the states of Mississippi, Florida and Texas, and another class-action lawsuit in Miami, are scheduled for trial in coming months.
All are part of a four-decade legal assault which may be costing the industry as much as $600 million a year to counter.
A loss in the Broin case might also unleash another wave of class-action and other individual lawsuits against U.S. cigarette makers, which already face an estimated 1,000 current claims in the United States, lawyers said.
The Broin case, which wound through Florida courts for six years, comes to trial just as state governments and cigarette companies are negotiating a deal likely to block many types of anti-tobacco suits and settle the 29 lawsuits brought by state attorneys general.
The landmark talks may also yield industry acceptance of stiff U.S. marketing and sales regulations and creation of a $300 billion pool to pay for the medical care of sick smokers.
"
MichaelConnor,"The Florida judge in the Broin secondhand-smoke lawsuit on Thursday said he may undo the class-action status of the case, a move that would likely delay the start of a trial, scheduled for Monday.
Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye said during a hearing that even if tobacco companies were found liable by a jury for injuries caused by secondhand smoke, the claims of an estimated 60,000 plaintiffs might be too cumbersome for a single trial.  
Kaye said determining the direct linkage of secondhand smoke to individual ailments and setting the amounts due each of the non-smoking flight attendants covered by the Broin suit might be nearly impossible.
""I am very concerned about these issues,"" Kaye said.
The judge, who is also weighing a tobacco-industry request that fraud and conspiracy allegations be dropped from the suit, gave no indication when he might rule. Another pre-trial hearing was scheduled for Friday.  
Kaye five years ago knocked down the class-action status of the Broin case, first filed in 1991, but was overturned three years ago by a Florida appeals court, which ordered a trial after hearing tobacco company arguments the case was too cumbersome.
In a class-action suit, a few plaintiffs claim damages on behalf of a broader group with similar injuries. All share in damage payments, if there are any.  
The Broin case, named after American Airlines flight attendant Norma Broin, alleges that cigarette smoke aboard U.S. passenger jets caused the lung cancer and other ailments of thousands of non-smoking flight attendants. In-flight smoking in the United States was banned in 1988.
In court on Thursday, tobacco company lawyers asked Kaye to end the class-action status of the Broin suit and said each of the claims needed to be tried individually, since many factors beyond cigarette smoke may have caused the flight attendants' injuries.  
""This cannot proceed as a class action without dissolving into 60,000 individual trials,"" said Hugh Whiting, an attorney for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.
Susan Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the Broin case, said people with like injuries could be grouped for determining damages if the tobacco companies should be found liable in the first stage of the trial. Such sessions would be ""relatively simple,"" she said.  
She also said a financial settlement might be worked out with the tobacco companies if a jury should rule against them. ""They don't like to talk about that but it's a possibility,"" she said.
Tobacco companies have yet to pay a single dollar in damages, despite four decades of U.S. lawsuits, but they are now in secret talks with government officials that might end some of the court actions against the industry.  
Kaye asked Rosenblatt what would happen if he should end the class-action status of Broin. She said she and her co-counsel and husband, Stanley Rosenblatt, were not now prepared for such a late change.

MichaelConnor,"Ordinarily seated at the rear of a courtroom, behind deep ranks of dark-suited corporate lawyers fighting anti-cigarette lawsuits, is the mystified legal defender of Dosal Tobacco Co.
""What am I doing here?"" Jose Martinez often asks as he fidgets through yet another courtroom hearing in one of the high-profile tobacco cases heading for trial.
Martinez, of the Miami law firm Martinez, Gutierrez &amp; DeCordoba, puts that question to judges and to plaintiff attorneys pressing lawsuits on behalf of sick smokers, non-smokers claiming injuries from other people's cigarette fumes and the State of Florida, which is seeking tobacco money for Medicaid costs.
""We're just a small manufacturer, a family operation. We shouldn't be here,"" Martinez insists to anyone who will listen.
Dosal -- now swept up in one of the great legal battles of the century -- is a tiny family-owned company based in Opa-Locka, a poor city north of Miami built by a real estate developer with a fanciful taste for Moorish architecture.
It makes but a few million cigarettes a year -- compared with Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the largest cigarette maker in the world, which last year shipped nearly 231 billion cigarettes in the United States alone.
Still, Dosal's name appears in three anti-tobacco lawsuits in Florida and another in Michigan, along with deep-pocketed giants such as RJR Nabisco Holdings and Philip Morris, which last year had more than $35 billion in tobacco sales.
Dosal's main customer is the Florida prison system, which sells Dosal's DTC brand cigarettes in regular and king-sized lengths to the smokers among the state's 50,000 inmates.
Even so, Dosal is named in the state's lawsuit against tobacco companies.
Dosal also makes a brand or two favored by elderly Cuban emigres in south Florida, including Competidora.
""They buy bulk tobacco and make cigarettes on machines in Opa-Locka. It's a very small operation,"" Martinez said. ""And the customers for the Cuban brands are old and dying.""
Good-humored and joking much of the time, Martinez is deadly serious about eliminating the legal threat to Dosal.
In addition to filing formal requests that Dosal be dropped, he presses plaintiff lawyers informally with arguments on the futility of suing a company with limited financial resources.
""I ask every day,"" Martinez says.
If kept in the lawsuits, including the so-called Broin class-action suit scheduled to go to trial Monday in Miami, Dosal could be made to pay a share of any monetrary judgment. The lawyers pressing the Broin case intend to ask for $5 billion or more in damages.
And while the tobacco industry has yet to pay out a dollar in court damages after four decades of litigation, leaks in the industry's defenses are widely seen on Wall Street and elsewhere.
The Broin case, being brought on behalf of an estimated 60,000 ailing and non-smoking flight attendants by lawyers Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt, is the first of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits coming to trial this year against U.S. cigarette makers.

""All the other suits copied theirs.""

MichaelConnor,"The judge in the Broin secondhand-smoke trial ruled on Tuesday that prospective jurors be questioned separately out of fear that strongly felt differences over tobacco may unduly influence others and perhaps even influence the outcome of the $5 billion case.
Judge Robert Kaye said that, while he was eager to get a jury in place, he was worried about possible fallout from news stories on the trial and feared that inflammatory opinions expressed in open court might unfairly influence a verdict.
Individual questioning of potential jurors in the case, known as Broin vs. Philip Morris et al, would continue ""so as to not infect the rest of the panel with some dangerous remarks,"" Kaye ruled.
In the historic case -- the first class action and first secondhand-smoke case against the tobacco industry to go to trial -- some 60,000 non-smoking airline flight attendants are suing nine cigarette companies for maladies they claim were caused by smoke from airline passengers' cigarettes.
In the first two days of jury selection prospective jurors expressed widely varying opinions about cigarette smoking.
One said secondhand smoke very likely caused disease in non-smokers while another compared lawsuits against tobacco companies for smoking-related illnesses to suing Kentucky Fried Chicken for Americans' high cholesterol.
Jury selection has been slow, with only five out of 29 individuals examined Monday making an initial cut.
Six jurors and between six and 12 alternate jurors are needed for the trial, which is expected to turn on dense statistical arguments and detailed evidence from scientists and physicians.
Participants in the case do not expect testimony to begin until at least next week.
Lawyers for the two sides clashed Tuesday over procedures for questioning of potential jurors.
Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the class-action lawsuit named for lung-cancer survivor Norma Broin, told Kaye he wanted to ask more questions of potential jurors than he can manage in the 20 minutes to 30 minutes he has so far spent on each person.
Rosenblatt said he would be willing to ask the questions of large groups in order to save time.
But David Hardy, an attorney for two tobacco companies, said the questioning of individual potential jurors separated from others was vital.
""There were several comments, which if heard by a group, would have prompted a presumption of a poisioned panel,"" Hardy said, referring to early questioning of potential jurors.
Rosenblatt argued that the risk of any influence from an individual comment was slight and could be handled with instructions from the judge.
""If someone disagrees with a terrible opinion, we can deal with that,"" Rosenblatt said.
The judge ruled, however, that individual questioning would continue.
Kaye already had placed limits on attorneys talking to reporters and barred the identification and photography of potential jurors, who are identified only by number.
He also assured lawyers in court that the 200 or more people awaiting questioning were in courthouse rooms with televisions tuned only to non-news programmes.
Kaye later dismissed, at the tobacco companies' request, a retired truck driver who said he had quit smoking after 23 years and believed strongly that secondhand smoke was dangerous.
""When people smoke around you, do you ask them to stop?"" Hugh Whiting, another tobacco company attorney, asked the man.
""I move from around them,"" the man said.
""Because it makes you sick?""
""That's right. I'm very delicate,"" the man said.
Kaye also excused a college student who said a two-month trial would prevent her from taking a course in sociology.
Other people questioned Tuesday included an organiser of Miami's annual Orange Bowl Parade and a retired police dispatcher who quit smoking when cigarettes rose to 50 cents a pack. ""I was too cheap,"" she said.
Rosenblatt has said he intends to ask for $5 billion or more in damages if tobacco companies are found liable for the lung cancer and other tobacco-related ailments among the flight attendants. Smoking on U.S. passenger jets was banned in 1988.
"
MichaelConnor,"Tobacco-industry lawyers in the $5 billion Broin secondhand smoke case on Tuesday touched off a testy outburst from the trial judge, who accused them of muddling the minds of prospective jurors with trick questions.
""We pull them apart,"" Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye told Edward Moss, an attorney for Brown &amp; Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain. ""We are playing with their heads.""
Kaye, speaking towards the end of a second, slow day of jury selection in the landmark trial, criticised the questions put to jurors by Moss and attorneys for other big tobacco companies such as Philip Morris Cos Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco as too firmly aimed at uncovering anti-smoking attitudes among the prospective jurors.
""You have been playing with people's heads for two days ...,"" Kaye said.
Kaye said smoking was a widely controversial practice, making it impossible to find a fully neutral jury of six and as many as a dozen alternative jurors to hear the case. Florida law only required that jurors be able to put aside their prejudices and decide on the evidence presented, he said.
Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney for the 60,000 sick flight attendants represented in the Broin class-action suit, said, ""These are consumate mind games that are being played by very skilful lawyers. Their problem is that they are looking for people that live in a cave ... uninformed people.""
The clash came after the questioning of a young musician who said her voice had been harmed from secondhand smoke while singing in nightclubs. But, under follow-up questioning by Kaye, she said she could set aside her belief that cigarettes should be banned in the United States and decide a verdict just on the evidence presented at the trial.
Kaye refused a tobacco lawyers request that the musician be bumped as prejudiced against cigarette makers but she can be dropped later if the tobacco lawyers choose to use one of 27 juror challenges they may make without explanation.
The woman was just one of six prospective jurors who survived some six hours of courtroom questioning on Tuesday. The other five included an organiser of Miami's annual Orange Bowl parade, a retired police dispatcher and a bookings manager for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. Eleven people have now made past the initial round of attorney queries.
At least a dozen more people are to be questioned on Wednesday, Kaye said.
Earlier, the judge sided with tobacco lawyers who opposed a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups, instead of one by one. Kaye said that, while he was eager to get a jury in place, he was worried about possible fallout from news stories on the trial and feared that inflammatory opinions expressed in open court might unfairly influence a verdict.
Individual questioning of potential jurors in the case, known as Broin vs. Philip Morris et al, would continue ""so as to not infect the rest of the panel with some dangerous remarks,"" Kaye ruled.
In the historic case -- the first class action and first secondhand smoke case against the tobacco industry to go to trial -- non-smoking airline flight attendants are suing nine cigarette companies for maladies they claim were caused by smoke from airline passengers' cigarettes.
In the first two days of jury selection prospective jurors expressed widely varying opinions about cigarette smoking.
One said secondhand smoke very likely caused disease in non-smokers while another compared lawsuits against tobacco companies for smoking-related illnesses to suing Kentucky Fried Chicken for Americans' high cholesterol.
Rosenblatt has said he intends to ask for $5 billion or more in damages if tobacco companies are found liable for the lung cancer and other tobacco-related ailments among the flight attendants. Smoking on U.S. passenger jets was banned in 1988.
"
MichaelConnor,"Tobacco industry lawyers Wednesday accused the judge hearing a second-hand smoking suit of failing to reject potential jurors with anti-cigarette prejudices.
Another five people, including a freelance television-news producer opposed by tobacco lawyers, passed initial questioning on Wednesday in the class-action case, bringing to 16 the people in the potential-jurors pool.
Court officials said 80 or more potential jurors will be needed to find the six-member jury and the 12 alternates to decide whether U.S. cigarette makers are liable for lung cancer and other smoking-related ailments among 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants. Jury selection is expected to continue for several weeks.
Jury selection began on Monday, and Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye has intermittently asked follow-up questions to potential jurors after rival lawyers finish probing individuals' attitudes toward tobacco use, big tobacco companies and their own smoking habits.
Kaye, who accused tobacco lawyers late Tuesday of muddling the minds of prospective jurors, on Wednesday put questions to a Miami police department payroll clerk after she told Edward Moss, a lawyer for Brown &amp; Williamson, the U.S. cigarette business of B.A.T Industries of Britain, she believed cigarettes should be banned. She also said she was initially more sympathetic to the flight attendants than to the tobacco defendants such as Philip Morris.
Kaye subsequently asked if she could put aside her sympathies and make a fair decision based on evidence presented during the trial and the woman said she could.
Moss protested immediately after the woman left the courtroom.
Moss said the judge's questioning was unfair to the tobacco companies and asked that the woman be eliminated from consideration because she was biased against cigarette companies. ""Her responses indicate the defendants have a different burden than the plaintiffs,"" Moss said.
""That is a matter for the court to decide,"" Kaye said, refusing to block the woman.
A similar clash occured late Tuesday, when Kaye accused the tobacco lawyers of manipulative questioning of jurors and Moss said the judge should not question the jurors.
Kaye also rejected a tobacco lawyer's request that a freelance television-news producer be blocked. The woman said she had sued a big corporation several years ago and had worked on stories about cigarettes for a Miami station but that she could weigh the evidence fairly.
Other people questioned and allowed to pass into the prospective jurors pool included a Pan American jet dispatcher and an office worker with two young children.
Jury questioning has been slow, with each side spending 20 minutes or more querying each person. Next week, the court will question jurors only on Monday and Tuesday because of a break for a Jewish holiday.
"
MichaelConnor,"A Miami television journalist who produced a news report on niche-brand cigarettes was knocked from the pool of standby jurors in Florida's $5 billion secondhand smoke trial on Thursday.
The unidentified female television-news producer was among 15 people questioned by judge and lawyers on Wednesday. She said she had produced a television report for Fox station WSVN Channel 7 on cigarette marketing, scheduled for broadcast that evening. Despite tobacco lawyers objections, she was placed in the pool of potential jurors to sit on the trial, expected to last eight weeks or longer.
Tobacco company lawyers again on Thursday asked Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye to remove the freelance news producer, saying her piece negatively portrayed tobacco companies and reflected a bias making her unsuitable to fairly decide whether the defendants are liable for the smoking-related illnesses of 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants.
A tape of the short television report on flashily packaged Black Death, City and other so-called micro-brand cigarettes favored by some young smokers was shown in court and included interviews with shopkeepers, young smokers and a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society.
Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the class-action suit, said the television report had been very likely edited by other journalists and did not necessarily reflect the mindset of the news producer.
But Kaye sided with the tobacco lawyers and removed the woman from the standby jurors pool, saying, ""The appearance that it was weighted would make it inappropriate for her to be seated.""
After four days of jury selection, the standby jurors pool numbers 18. Some 60 are needed to seat a jury of six. A second round of screening will be required to find between six and 12 alternates before testimony can begin in the landmark trial, a court official said.
A nurse, a college student and an immigrant from Mexico were placed in the standby pool on Thursday. People excused by Kaye include a nun who described smoking as a vice and the sure cause of diseases she has seen firsthand as a nurse and several people with schooling or vacation plans fixed firmly during June and July.
Kaye late on Wednesday said he was reconsidering a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups as a way of speeding up jury selection. Tobacco company lawyers objected, saying that since smoking and attitudes about secondhand cigarette smoke were hot-buttom matters people had to be questioned separately.
A court official said Kaye would likely decide on group questioning of prospective jurors on Friday or later. Kaye earlier this week refused a similar request from Rosenblatt.
Jury questioning for the trial, the first on secondhand smoke claims, is likely to run through at least mid-June, in part because the jury selection next week will occur only on Monday and Tuesday because of a break for Jewish holidays.

MichaelConnor,"Tobacco company lawyers defending against the $5 billion Broin secondhand-smoke lawsuit are ahead in the race to seat favorable jurors, repeatedly knocking out nurses and others who say secondhand smoke probably causes disease, according to trial consultants.
""Tobacco's been really lucky at getting out people with knowledge about smoking and health -- all those nurses,"" said one Florida trial consultant after five days of jury picking for the Broin trial. ""The plaintiffs must be crying.""
Thirty-two people, out of more than 75 closely questioned by rival lawyers and the trial judge, passed initial screening last week and may be among the six chosen to decide whether or not cigarette giants such as Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco are liable for heart ailments and other smoking-related diseases among 60,000 flight attendants who never smoked.
The flight attendants, including Norma Broin, a 42-year-old employee of American Airlines who had lung cancer, allege that cigarette smoke from passengers aboard U.S. passenger jets caused their illnesses. Smoking on U.S. jets was banned in 1988.
""The tobacco lawyers are maneuvering very well to get jurors excused for cause,"" said Stanley Rosenblatt, who along with his wife is pressing the landmark flight-attendants lawsuit. ""They don't want anyone educated who knows that secondhand smoke causes disease.""
The trial consultants monitoring jury-picking agreed, with one saying the perfect juror for the tobacco industry would be a conservative white male smoker with minimal formal education.
""You could hear a groan in the courtroom when that snuff user got bumped,"" said one consultant, referring to a Caucasian father in his thirties who dismissed the flight attendants' lawsuit as ridiculous. ""They really wanted him.""
By contrast, the Rosenblatts ideally want mothers in the jury pool with at least a college education, a distaste for smoking and a healthy suspicion of big institutions such as highly profitable tobacco companies, the consultants said.
Tobacco lawyers declined to comment, but the trial consultants, speaking on a promise of anonymity, said, ""Anyone in the health industry is good for the Rosenblatts and bad for the tobacco companies.""
Several nurses, including a nun who described smoking as a vice since it was harmful to both smokers and non-smokers, were challenged successfully by tobacco lawyers for causes such as an anti-tobacco bias. Like the Rosenblatts, the tobacco lawyers later in the jury-picking can block as many as 27 people from the jury without any explanation.
While many people questioned last week objected to smoking on health grounds, only one person, a bank executive with two small children, said she had a strong bias against ""powerful and influential tobacco companies.""
A dozen or more prospective jurors said U.S. airlines that employed the flight attendants were responsible for any sicknesses caused by secondhand smoke and not the tobacco companies. The airlines are sheltered from the lawsuits by U.S. workers' compensation laws, passed in the early 1900s, lawyers said.
Among the people chosen as standby jurors were a civil engineer, a newspaper-truck driver, a waiter, a painter and a retired police-department dispatcher. Some were smokers or ex-smokers and many were non-smokers.
Rosenblatt and the trial consultants said they were at this time unconcerned about the jury's eventual composition since another 30 or so standbys had to be chosen and discretionary challenges can always be used. Jury selection is to continue Monday and Tuesday and resume again on June 16.
The consultants said rulings by trial Judge Robert Kaye of Dade County Circuit Court on standby jurors at first seemed to favor the flight attendants, but later tilted toward tobacco companies.
The judge has twice reversed decisions on standby jurors, including knocking out a Miami television-news producer on Thursday whom a day earlier he had let into the standby group over tobacco lawyers' objections. Kaye reversed himself after seeing a two-minute news story she had produced on the marketing of flashily packaged micro-brand cigarettes such as Black Death and City.
Late on Friday, Kaye changed course again and ordered that jury questioning be done in groups of six, instead of by individual examination, as a way of accelerating jury selection.

MureDickie,"Foreign lenders owed money by members of China's chaotic investment trust house sector risk an unpredictable official response in the case of default or collapse, rating agency Moody's Investors Service has warned.
Regulators struggling to rein in wayward trust houses were unlikely to rush to rescue those that failed, the agency said in a report issued just days after the central bank announced the closure of one of China's largest investment firms.
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, announced last week it had shut down the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC) because of serious illegal and irregular business practices that had caused it huge losses.
""Moody's believes that regulatory support for institutions in trouble... will continue to be unpredictable, and will overall be less likely to be forthcoming from the central bank in the future,"" the agency said.
""Where little public interest is involved, it is probable that the central regulators would not be active in encouraging or financing a rescue, preferring a default in an attempt to impose some order on an increasingly chaotic system,"" it said.
The central bank's lack of political clout in dealing with the trust houses, some of which were mere speculative vehicles for powerful institutional sponsors, had resulted in a selective approach to dealing with their problems, it said.
Foreign lenders had so far been mostly repaid after the reported closure of more than 100 non-bank financial institutions in recent months, but such a policy was far from guaranteed, it said.
China has yet to announce detailed plans for creditors to CADTIC, which was backed by the Ministry of Agriculture, but analysts have suggested that at least some foreign companies with outstanding loans might lose out.
The central bank said repayment priority would be given to domestic individual creditors, with other lenders to be repaid after the liquidation of what was China's biggest trust after the China International Trust and Investment Corp (CITIC).
CADTIC's collapse highlighted the difficulties Beijing faces in policing the financial sector while managing the transition from strict central planning to the new market-style economy.
Regulators were likely to take a more supportive approach towards problems among China's largest state banks than towards those encountered by the trust houses, Moody's said.
The big four state banks -- the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China -- already received a great deal of government support on a daily basis, the agency said.
The banks would all be insolvent if their loan values were written down to reflect impairment, but resolution of this problem would require a complete restructuring of the state sector as well as bank recapitalisation, it said.
While China's other large commercial banks had much sounder finances, official support for them in the event of problems was uncertain, Moody's said.
Regulators could well tolerate the failure of a large bank if it was deemed to be the result of imprudence, illegality or incompetence, while struggling small banks were unlikely to receive any support at all, it said.
"
MureDickie,"Hainan Airlines plans to buy 10 airliners from Boeing Corp in the next two years in a major fleet expansion to be funded by bonds, loans and China's first public airline share issue, company officials said.
The regional airline, which is based in the southern tropical island province of Hainan, had already agreed on a basic contract with the U.S. planemaker for four 737-400s and three 737-800s, said airline chairman and president Chen Feng.
Hainan Airlines was also waiting for approval from China's aviation authorities to buy three Boeing 767 aircraft for around $60-70 million each, Chen told Reuters in an interview in the provincial capital, Haikou.
Delivery of both the Boeing 737s and 767s was expected to begin in 1998, when Hainan Airlines also planned to bring into operation seven new Metro 23 light aircraft from U.S. manufacturer Fairchild Aircraft Inc, company officials said.
""Next year we plan to take about 20 aircraft,"" Chen said. ""It's big money... minimum $600 million.""
The airline, which currently operates nine Boeing 737s and a handful of turboprops and executive jets, would take out options on a further three 737-800s, said chief economist Li Bing.
""We have hired a lot of new pilots,"" Li said.
Part of the cost of the new aircraft would be covered by the airline's planned issue of about 80 million foreign currency B shares to be listed on the Shanghai bourse in the first quarter of this year, company officials said.
The issue, originally scheduled for last year, is expected to make Hainan the first airline to list publicly on one of China's two domestic exchanges.
The airline hoped to list two million domestic currency A shares in Shanghai shortly after issuing the dollar-denominated B shares, raising at least $30 million, Chen said.
""The money we get for the shares we will certainly use for fleet expansion,"" said economist Li, adding that proceeds would also be directed toward training and recruitment and would be far from enough to cover major aircraft purchases.
The airline planned to issue $300 million in bonds in the United States to help to finance fleet expansion and expected financial support from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, said Chen.
Li said the airline, which is 25 percent owned by American Aviation Investment, a fund partially controlled by U.S. financier George Soros, was waiting for approval from China's aviation authorities before signing the 737 deal.
Company officials said the turbulent diplomatic relationship between Washington and Beijing could sometimes make buying U.S. jets a sensitive political issue, but such considerations were not expected to delay approval of the 737 deal.
Sino-U.S. ties have warmed sharply in recent months, bolstered by high-level contacts and a January visit by U.S. congressmen that U.S. diplomats said helped to hasten the sale this month of two Boeing 747s to flagship carrier Air China.
That deal was followed on Monday by Boeing's announcement of a $68 million order for two 737s from China's Yunnan Airlines.
Hainan Airlines officials said they had seriously considered buying from Boeing's European arch-rival Airbus Industrie but had been put off by the training and technical costs of a switch from the U.S. manufacturer.

MureDickie,"China and the United States began talks to hammer out their textile trade differences on Tuesday with both sides voicing optimism that agreement could be reached before a Friday deadline.
Washington and Beijing had a productive first day of a scheduled three days of talks aimed at extending a bilateral textile accord and resolving a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, said top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes.
""Very productive morning,"" Hayes said, adding that much remained to be done. ""We still have lots of issues to resolve."" ""We are maintaining an optimistic attitude towards the prospects of these textile talks,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing. ""The resolution of this problem will be beneficial for both sides.""
The 1994 Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 last year but was extended by one month to allow the two sides to seek compromise on the terms of its renewal.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries that have prompted U.S. threats of multi-million dollar penalties and raised the spectre of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue.
The Friday deadline for a renewed textile accord could not be pushed back once more -- but U.S. officials believed agreement would be reached in time, Hayes said before her talks at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
""The deadline is January 31 and there are no more extensions, so we have to reach agreement,"" she told reporters, adding that sparring over textiles was not likely to lead to a trade conflict.
""We are in hopes that the consultations will continue the mood that they had in the previous consultations and that is that both sides are trying to get an agreement,"" she said.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Chinese spokesman Shen said Beijing wanted to sit down to study seriously U.S. views on the textile debate.
""I believe that none of us, including the U.S. side, hopes to see a trade war,"" he said.
China's large textile exports to U.S. and European customers have long been a source of diplomatic dispute but have in recent years become especially sensitive for U.S. trade officials eager to reduce Washington's swelling trade deficit.
Sino-U.S. ties have been strained by disputes over issues ranging from trade to Taiwan to human rights, but tensions have eased greatly in recent months and U.S. diplomats have suggested Beijing is keen to do more to balance the trade books.
As negotiatior Hayes discussed textile issues, U.S. trade official Lee Sands was due in the Chinese capital on Tuesday for meetings expected to focus on Beijing's long-stalled entry to the World Trade Organisation.
Beijing has been vocal in blaming Washington for blocking its accession to the global trade club, which China wants to join on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries.

MureDickie,"U.S. and Chinese officials have made a productive start to textile trade talks that are the last chance to hammer out a deal before a Friday deadline, top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said on Tuesday.

The two sides failed to reach agreement on the issue in talks in the United States last month. Washington said then it would re-examine its decision to reduce quotas for Chinese textile imports.
China's textile sales to the United States have long been a sensitive point for U.S. trade negotiators eager to reduce Washington's swelling trade deficit.

MureDickie,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Wednesday called for tougher action to curb the spreading cancer of corruption, saying the war on graft was a vital struggle for the destiny of the nation and its ruling Communist Party.
The unity of Party and people was vital to bolster enthusiasm for developing China but was threatened by graft in communist ranks, the official Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as telling the Party's Central Disciplinary Inspection Committee.
""The war against corruption is a serious political struggle for the hearts of the Party and the people and will affect the destiny of the Party and the state,"" said Jiang, who has staked much of his political credibility on curbing graft.
""On this issue our banner must be bright, our attitude steadfast and our work carried through with perseverance,"" he told a meeting of the disciplinary committee that was attended by Premier Li Peng and other leaders.
Corruption, almost unknown in China under the Stalinist rule of the late Chairman Mao Zedong, has boomed during nearly two decades of market-style economic reform.
China's top anti-graft official on Monday said Beijing had scored major successes in battling corruption in 1996 but called for greater efforts this year to fight abuses by officials eager to barter their bureaucratic clout for economic gain.
Disciplinary authorities had punished more than 116,000 people in 1997, up 14.3 percent from the year before, said disciplinary committee chairman Wei Jianxing.
More than 72,000 officials had owned up to using their positions to obtain better housing, with 74 percent handing over a total of 94 million yuan ($11.3 million) to pay for the housing, he said.
All too many of the Communist Party's 57 million members were forgetting its socialist traditions of gritty struggle and frugality, leading to increasing extravagence, waste and one-upmanship, said Jiang.
""The existence of such phenomena provides a hotbed that cloaks and allows the spread of even more serious problems of corruption,"" he said.
Analysts say Jiang, who in 1989 was plucked from his post as Shanghai party secretary to become anointed successor to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, is anxious to win popular loyalties with his high-profile anti-graft campaign.
While the president and party chief has won some credit from the disgrace of corrupt officials as senior as former Beijing party chief and Politburo member Chen Xitong, many Chinese say results of the corruption crackdown have been patchy at best.
Party members at all levels had to do more to ensure honest government, Jiang told the disciplinary committee.
""Currently the situation of the war on corruption is still serious, the task of rectifying Party tendencies is still onerous and the development of the work uneven,"" he said.
China's communists should heighten their vigilance and build on their successes as they worked to modernise China, he said.
""The great success of 18 years of reform and opening and modernising construction strongly testifies that this party of ours is a good party,"" he said.
"
MureDickie,"China on Wednesday told U.S. President Bill Clinton not to worry about Chinese human rights and Hong Kong's future freedoms, saying Beijing's rights record spoke for itself and liberty in the British colony was assured.
Clinton said on Tuesday that Washington had made less progress than hoped in influencing Chinese rights policies and warned that Hong Kong's value to China might fall if liberties in the colony were lost after it returns to Beijing's rule.
""The national conditions of China and the United States are not the same and it is natural for different views on human rights to exist,"" said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in reaction to Clinton's comments.
The reaction -- exceedingly mild by Beijing's standards -- came as Chinese and U.S. officials met in the capital to discuss trade and human rights, issues that have long dogged the cross-Pacific relationship.
In its report on Clinton's remarks, China's official Xinhua news agency mentioned only the U.S. president's defence of his engagement policy towards China, and said nothing of his comment that liberty's advance in the authoritarian communist nation was inevitable.
Analysts said Beijing was determined to keep up the momentum of a recent Sino-U.S. rapprochement and would not allow it to be derailed by Clinton's remarks on Hong Kong and human rights.
Concerns over the future of the British colony, which reverts to China at midnight on June 30, were unfounded, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.
China had guaranteed freedom for Hong Kong's people with its mini-constitution for the territory, the Basic Law, she said.
""Under the Basic Law the people of Hong Kong have full freedom and all democratic rights,"" she said. ""There is no basis or need for doubt or concern about this.""
China's own constitution and laws protected the rights of members of all its nationalities, she said.
""The efforts and achievements made by the Chinese government in this area are there for all to see,"" she said. ""Anyone who is not biased will reach a fair conclusion.""
A U.S. delegation arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks on human rights with Chinese officials, after a year in which almost all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement were either imprisoned or driven into exile.
The delegation was seeking concessions that could make it unnecessary this year for Washington to sponsor a U.N. resolution faulting China's rights policy, U.S. officials said.
A Western diplomat in Beijing said the delegation's arrival was a sign of Chinese and U.S. determination to bolster the recent warming in ties that has helped soften the impact of disputes over issues ranging from Taiwan to copyright piracy.
However, the delegation was unlikely to extract sufficient clear concessions from Beijing to make it politically viable for Clinton not to sponsor a critical resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in March, the diplomat said.
Talks on issues such as human rights should take overall ties into account and should be carried out on a basis of equality, the Chinese spokeswoman said.
"
MureDickie,"China and the United States made progress Thursday in talks on a new textile accord but negotiations could stretch late into the night on the last day before a deadline for agreement, a U.S. trade official said.
""We hope to complete the talks tonight,"" chief negotiator Rita Hayes said after talks Thursday morning with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
Progress had been made on market access, she said. But the two sides still had a long way to go on the third day of talks to renew a 1994 textile accord and resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, she said.
Washington could make significant cuts in China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the Jan. 31 deadline, Hayes said.
""We still have a lot of issues, so that means a lot of work today, probably late into the night,"" she said. ""We are not going to give China another extension because we have already given them another month.""
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on Dec. 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. The United States has threatened multi-million dollar penalties and raised the specter of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue.
""I am always optimistic and I am in hopes that we will complete the round today ... but that is something both sides have to work very hard on,"" Hayes said.
If an agreement was not reached in time, past practice showed that the United States could cut China's textile import quota significantly until a deal was struck, she said.
""I am in hopes that it won't come to that. China doesn't want it to come to that -- and certainly the States doesn't,"" she said.
In Washington, acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday that the talks were proceeding fairly well.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.

MureDickie,"China on Thursday slammed a plan by rival Taiwan to ship nuclear waste to North Korea, saying the scheme was a blatant attempt by Taipei to split the country and spoil Beijing's ties with its communist neighbour.
China was also concerned by the environmental implications of the January 11 contract under which Taiwan will ship up to 200,000 barrels of low-level nuclear waste to North Korea, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said.
""China's government and people express their resolute opposition to the actions of the Taiwan authorities,"" Shen told a news briefing in Beijing.
Taiwan's nuclear waste plan was a clear attack on Beijing's cherished goal of reunification with the Nationalist-ruled island, Shen said. China considers Taiwan a renegade province.
It was also an assault on China's diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, a Stalinist neighbour with which Beijing has for decades shared an alliance that Chinese propaganda has termed ""as close as lips and teeth"".
""(The Taiwan authorities') goal is also very clear: it is to destroy China's relations with the country concerned and obstruct the improvement and development of ties across the Taiwan Strait,"" Shen said.
Beijing has diplomatic relations with both Pyongyang and its arch rival Seoul, neither of which formally recognises Taiwan. North and South Korea are still technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace accord.
While China says it cherishes its close alliance with cash-strapped North Korea, analysts say the relationship has been cooled in recent years by Beijing's ties with Seoul and by Pyongyang's reluctance to reform its moribund economy.
South Korea, which dropped diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1992 to formalise links with Beijing, has expressed concern that radiation from the Taiwanese waste could pollute the Korean peninsula -- a fear echoed by Shen.
""The technological demands of nuclear waste management are very serious,"" the Chinese spokesman said.
""If it is not managed properly or unexpected events occur it can pollute surrounding countries and regions,"" he said. ""The Chinese side is highly concernced about this.""
Taipei maintains the pact to ship low-level waste from Taiwan Power Co nuclear plants to North Korea complies with all international regulations and that shipments would be securely packed in steel barrels.
Despite escalating protests against the deal, Taiwan and North Korea forged ahead on Tuesday with preparations for an initial shipment of 60,000 barrels of waste.
Seoul and diplomatic ally Washington have long seen North Korean attempts to build a nuclear power industry as a potential cloak for the development of nuclear weapons that could shift the balance of power on the heavily militarised peninsula.
U.S. officials said this week said they saw no nuclear arms proliferation threat from the low-level waste shipments but signalled Washington was aware of Seoul's environmental fears.

MureDickie,"U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to visit China in late February in a trip aimed at further improving ties that have warmed rapidly in recent months, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
""China places great importance on this visit,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.
Albright would hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and a wide range of issues was expected to be discussed, Shen said.
Albright's first visit as Secretary of State comes at a time when relations between China and the United States are warming swiftly, with U.S. Vice President Al Gore reported to be preparing to visit Beijing in late March.
U.S. President Bill Clinton met China's President Jiang Zemin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila last November and the two agreed on an exchange of presidential visits, the first since early 1989.
""A major topic of the meeting of the two foreign ministers will be how to push forward relations on the basis of the presidential meeting,"" Shen said of Albright's visit.
Former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to China last November on a fence-mending visit that both sides hailed as a major step in repairing ties ravaged by disputes for well over a year.
The announcement of Albright's China trip coincides with a flurry of visits by U.S. officials to Beijing.
A U.S. human rights team led by Sandra Kristoff, the National Security Council's chief Asia expert, and including Peter Eicher, director of the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, was to conclude two days of talks in Beijing on Thursday.
The U.S. team was in China on the eve of the release of Washington's annual worldwide human rights report that once again slams Beijing's record.
This year's report says that by the end of 1996 there were almost no active dissidents left in China who had not been jailed or exiled.
Officials said the team would seek concessions from Beijing on human rights that could make it unnecessary this year for Washington to co-sponsor a United Nations resolution critical of China's policy.
Albright has vowed to confront Beijing on its human rights record, trade issues and weapon sales abroad -- all thorns in Sino-U.S. ties -- but says relations between the two Pacific giants cannot be held hostage to any one issue.
China on Wednesday told Clinton not to worry about Chinese human rights and Hong Kong's future freedoms, saying Beijing's rights record spoke for itself and liberty in the British colony was assured.
Clinton said on Tuesday that Washington had made less progress than hoped in influencing Chinese rights policies and warned that Hong Kong's value to China might fall if liberties in the colony were lost after it returns to Beijing rule.
Senior U.S. trade official Lee Sands began talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of cross-Pacific friction.
Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry.
Top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes was also in Beijing for talks to hammer out a new textile accord with negotiations seen extending right up to a Friday deadline for agreement.
"
MureDickie,"Washington's top textile trade negotiator said on Thursday talks with China on a textile accord were likely to stretch late into the night on the last day before a Friday deadline for agreement.
The two sides made progess but still had a long way to go on the third day of talks to renew their 1994 textile accord and resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, negotiator Rita Hayes told reporters.
Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the January 31 deadline, Hayes said before resuming the talks with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
""We still have a lot of issues, so that means a lot of work today, probably late into the night,"" she said. ""We are not going to give China another extension because we have already given them another month.""
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries, The United States has threatened multi-million dollar penalties and raised the spectre of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue.
""I am always optimistic and I am in hopes that we will complete the round today... but that is something both sides have to work very hard on,"" Hayes said.
If an agreement was not reached in time, past practice showed that the United States could cut China's textile import quota significantly until a deal was struck, she said.
""I am in hopes that it won't come to that, China doesn't want it to come to that -- and certainly the States doesn't,"" she said.
In Washington, acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said on Wednesday the talks were proceeding fairly well.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Textiles are just one of a range of issues dogging a Sino-U.S. relationship that has long been strained by disputes over topics ranging from trade to human rights to Taiwan.
Relations have improved dramatically in recent months, but many sources of potential dispute remain.
A U.S. delegation arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks on human rights with Chinese officials, after a year in which almost all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement have been either imprisoned or driven into exile.
U.S. trade official Lee Sands began talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), long a source of cross-Pacific friction.
Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry.
Sands declined to answer reporters' questions about the talks, but Hayes said a key U.S. requirement was further opening of China's protected markets.
""What we are asking China for is upfront market access, before they join the WTO,"" she said. ""We are still working out those differences.""
"
MureDickie,"China's jailing of leading dissident Wang Dan is clear evidence of the kind of abuse that this week led a U.S. report to condemn Beijing for its rights record, the former student leader's father said on Friday.
All nations had the right and responsibility to concern themselves with human rights in other countries, said Wang Xianzeng, whose son was last year sentenced to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.
""In Wang Dan's case, I know... the human rights situation is very bad,"" Wang Xiangzeng told Reuters by telephone.
""If (the United States) is seeking the truth in its concern with the Chinese human rights situation, then that is as it ought to be,"" he said.
In an annual human rights report on 193 countries released on Thursday, the United States accused China of effectively silencing public dissent against the government by detaining, jailing or driving into exile all known dissidents.
This year's hard-hitting report was released amid a dramatic improvement in Sino-U.S. ties that have long been rocked by disputes over issues ranging from rights to trade to Taiwan.
Analysts say Beijing, which stayed silent on the U.S. report on Friday and has recently reacted with uncharacteristic mildness to U.S. concerns over human rights and Hong Kong, is eager to keep up the positive momentum in cross-Pacific ties.
The recent Sino-U.S. rapprochement last October survived Wang Dan's jailing after a four-hour trial that was denounced by human rights activists as a politically-orchestrated sham.
Wang Xianzeng said his son, a former leader of 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army, had done nothing to justify the harsh sentence meted out by judges of the Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court.
""Nothing Wang Dan did...offended against the laws of China, as his parents we cannot agree with such a heavy sentence and we cannot accept the verdict,"" Wang Xianzeng said.
He said both he and Wang Dan's mother, 61-year-old museum researcher Wang Lingyun, planned to visit their son next month at his prison in Jinzhou city in China's Liaoning province.
Wang, who served four years in jail for his role in the 1989 protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was still suffering from numerous medical complaints that could not be treated at his draughty jail in China's frigid northeast, his father said.
""(Wang Dan) suffers many illnesses...they can't cope with serious complaints although they can deal with small problems or colds,"" he said.
Wang Dan was one of China's most articulate political dissenters between his parole from the 1989 sentence until he vanished into detention in May 1995.
His jailing and the later dismissal of his appeal were part of a series of hammer blows last year that all but silenced China's tiny band of pro-democracy activists.
U.S. officials have said human rights remain an important influence on Sino-U.S. relations, but have made clear that no one issue will be allowed to derail warming ties with Beijing.
China was not the only target of the U.S. State Department report, which also found problems with the rights records of allies Turkey, South Korea and Germany as well as Russia, Indonesia, Haiti and Nigeria.
Wang Xianzeng said it was only right for the international community to take an interest in the human rights records of different nations -- adding such interest could be mutual.
""China can also concern itself with human rights in the United States, can it not?"" he said.
"
MureDickie,"A World Trade Organisation (WTO) without China is a global trade body with a missing limb, but the world's most populous nation still must meet basic criteria before gaining entry, a British minister said on Thursday.
A robust approach could be taken to Beijing's application for WTO membership, Ian Lang, president of Britain's Board of Trade, told a news conference in the Chinese capital.
""A WTO without China would be a WTO with a limb missing,"" Lang said in an speech to Chinese and British businessmen that was released to reporters at the news conference.
""We very much support China's application to join the WTO. However, we also believe that China's accession must be on the right terms,"" Lang said.
""It has to be...on the same terms on which other countries have membership of the WTO,"" Lang told the news conference. ""It is important not to dilute the strength of the WTO.""
Beijing has been seeking to join the global trade body with developing country status, but some Western nations maintain that China's economy is too big to warrant such treatment.
""I understand the anxieties that China has, it...still feels it has a considerable way to go in some areas,"" Lang said.
""There are certain fundamental elements to approaching membership of the WTO that can be approached fairly robustly,"" he said. He cited trade transparency, market access, tariffs and legal structures as areas that needed further exploration.
A WTO working group will meet later this year in Geneva to try to negotiate a deal that would allow China's accession, but China said last month its prospects appeared bleak.
Lang said China and Britain were expected to sign a memorandum of understanding next month that would let Chinese companies list on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
Many cash-strapped Chinese companies are keen to apply for listing on overseas markets, but Chinese securities officials say agreement with the LSE has been long delayed by disputes between London and Beijing over Hong Kong.
Some 20 Chinese companies are listed in Hong Kong while a handful are traded in New York.
Lang said Sino-British ties were continuing to warm following high-level exchanges this year.
Relations between Beijing and London have been tested in recent years by disputes over the mid-1997 return of Hong Kong, now a British colony, to Chinese rule.
"
MureDickie,"Former U.S. president George Bush called on Thursday for an end to U.S. trade threats against China, saying more dialogue was needed between Washington and Beijing to mend cross-Pacific ties.
The United States should give China permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status to end the annual diplomatic battle over its renewal, Bush said in a speech at a seminar in Beijing.
""I am very concerned about the rancour that sometimes rears its head these days,"" he said. ""There is too much China-bashing in the United States of America.""
Some members of the U.S. Congress had little understanding of China and how to deal with Beijing, Bush said.
""Threatening China does not work,"" he said. ""It might be good domestic politics in some quarters of the United States, but it does not bring about change, and it ought to stop.""
Relations between Washington and Beijing have been badly strained this year by disputes over trade, copyright theft, nuclear proliferation and Taiwan.
Washington needs a strategic dialogue with Beijing to iron out differences before they become major disputes and to help stabilise a bilateral relationship that was of unsurpassed importance, Bush said.
""We can start by granting permanent, unconditional MFN for China,"" he told the Chinese and U.S. businessmen and officials in a speech salted with nostalgic references to his experiences as a diplomat in Beijing during the 1970s.
MFN give favourable tariff treatment to Chinese goods imported into the U.S.
Sino-U.S. ties chilled in March when Chinese missile tests off the coast of rival Taiwan led Washigton to send two aircraft carrier battle groups into the area in a show of force.
In June, the two sides narrowly averted a multi-billion dollar trade war over intellectual property theft in China, while alleged sales of Chinese nuclear technology to Pakistan and Beijing's fat U.S. trade surplus have also strained ties.
Both sides say relations have warmed in the last few months but Bush said more was needed, advising Beijing to value the contribution of U.S. businessmen in China -- a group that has long campaigned for better ties and permanent MFN.
""American business is China's best ally in reducing the misunderstanding and suspicions that cloud our relationship from time to time,"" Bush said.
"
MureDickie,"China and the United States signed a new textile agreement on Sunday in an eleventh-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and was hailed by both sides as a breakthrough.
U.S. officials said their main achievement was gaining assured access for the first time to Chinese textile markets, adding that it also granted China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact.
Millions of dollars in penalties slapped by Washington on Chinese imports remained in force under the deal, although Beijing had agreed to withdraw its threat of retaliation, top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said after the signing.
""For the first time the United States has market access with China...and this is something we felt very strongly about,"" Hayes told reporters. ""It is now a situation that we have a level playing field.""
The four-year textile accord was signed by Hayes and Li Dongsheng, China's chief negotiator and director of the trade management department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
Officials of both sides welcomed the deal, which was hammered out during negotiations that ran far beyond their original three-day schedule to become a gruelling six-day marathon topped by all-night sessions.
""After six days of hard work, the delegations have reached a rather ideal conclusion,"" said Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, who attended the signing ceremony.
Officials of both sides declined to give details of the accord, but Hayes said it would create U.S. jobs by allowing exports while slightly increasing China's U.S. import quota.
The talks focused on renewal of the 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, with market access for U.S. goods to China also a major stumbling block, officials said.
Breakthrough came during a one-day extension to the final deadline for renewal of the Sino-U.S. accord, which had originally been scheduled to expire on Dec. 31 but was extended by one month to allow time to reach a compromise.
""I think this morning at the beginning we were unhappy with each other, but now we have become friends,"" U.S. negotiator Li told Hayes during the signing of the accord.
The accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed the action to allow time for further talks.
After the signing of the textile accord, Beijing announced it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but U.S. negotiator Hayes said Washington's penalties remained in force.
""The transshipment charges that were made in September still stand as they did,"" she said without elaborating.
Access to China's huge and growing markets was also an issue in other Sino-U.S. meetings in Beijing last week.
U.S. trade official Lee Sands held two days of talks in the Chinese capital to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of bilateral friction.
""The agreement is once again proof that China and the United States can settle their trade disputes through negotiations based on equality and mutual benefits,"" said negotiator Li.

MureDickie,"China and the United States signed a new textile agreement on Sunday in an eleventh-hour deal that narrowly averted a multi-million dollar cross-Pacific trade war and was hailed by both sides as a breakthrough.
""China has the largest share of the U.S. market and we now have a share of the China market,"" top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said after the signing ceremony.
The fifth Sino-U.S. textile accord was signed by Hayes and Li Dongsheng, China's chief negotiator and director of the trade management department of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and welcomed by officials of both sides.
""After six days of hard work, the delegations have reached a rather ideal conclusion,"" China's Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi said.
The marathon talks that included at least two all-night sessions and dragged right through Saturday night had focused on renewal of the 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese textile exports.
Market access for U.S. goods to China had been a major stumbling block.
Breakthrough came during a one-day extension of a January 31 deadline for multi-million dollar penalties on China's exports, and it was clear disaster was only averted at the eleventh hour.
""I think this morning at the beginning we were unhappy with each other but now we have become friends,"" Li told Hayes before the signing.
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.
""This agreement eloquently demonstrates the common interests of the United States and China in developing trade and economic relations,"" state television quoted Li as saying.
Neither side gave details of the terms.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions. China had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Hayes had said issues at the forefront in the final rounds of talks were two major demands -- the U.S. market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.
""The agreement was a good start to 1997 for cross-Pacific relations,"" said U.S. embassy charge d'affaires William McCahill. ""This is a year of opportunity for Sino-U.S. relations.""
""(The deal) augurs very, very well for the year and the years ahead,"" he said.
Washington could have made significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement had not been reached.
Market access was an issue in other U.S.-China meetings in Beijing last week.
U.S. trade official Lee Sands held two days of talks in Beijing last week to discuss China's long-delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, a source of bilateral friction.
Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry.
However, Chinese officials seemed pleased with the textile deal.
""The agreement is once again proof that China and the United States can settle their trade disputes through negotiations based on equality and mutual benefits, thus creating a stable environment for the long-term development of bilateral economic and trade ties,"" Li said.
"
MureDickie,"China and the United States reached agreement on Sunday to extend a deal on textiles, averting a multi-billion dollar trade war, an official with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said.
""The two sides will be signing the agreement in a ceremony shortly,"" the official said by telephone.
The eleventh-hour agreement followed marathon all-night talks between U.S. chief textile negotiator Rita Hayes and a team of Chinese officials on renewal of a 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese textile exports.
Hayes had said on Saturday she was confident of accord in last-ditch talks after extending by a day a January 31 deadline for multi-million dollar penalties on China's exports.
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.

Hayes said earlier issues at the forefront in the final rounds of talks were two major demands -- the U.S. market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.
Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.
Washington could have made significant cuts to China's textile quotas if an agreement had not been reached before the deadline.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in the dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries.
"
MureDickie,"U.S. President Bill Clinton's commitment to pursue a deeper dialogue with Beijing in his State of the Union address is likely to reassure China that Washington is ready to take it seriously, analysts said on Wednesday.
The weight Clinton gave to boosting prickly cross-Pacific relations and his vow to visit China would be welcome signals from an administration that long appeared to put Beijing far down its list of priorities, said one Western diplomat.
""One of the things that has upset China about the Clinton administration is that it hasn't been treated as important enough,"" the diplomat said.
""The Clinton administration has now really realised the importance of Sino-U.S. relations,"" echoed a senior Chinese expert on U.S. policy.
""This year, it seems the Clinton administration plans to resolve Sino-U.S. problems and implement new policies,"" said the expert, who declined to be identified.
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Clinton said a deeper dialogue with China was vital for U.S. interests and vowed to exchange visits with Chinese President Jiang Zemin to boost cooperation and deal frankly with Sino-U.S. differences.
""An isolated China is not good for America,"" Clinton said. ""A China playing its proper role in the world is.""
The U.S. president's remarks came after months of rapid warming in a Sino-U.S. relationship that for years had been buffeted by diplomatic disputes over such issues as Taiwan, trade, copyright piracy and human rights.
The improvement in relations was bolstered by a series of high-level contacts, successful textile trade negotiations and by the charm offensive Beijing had aimed at members of the often-hostile U.S. Congress, the analysts said.
But weary diplomats in Beijing and Washington would have plenty of new worries to cope with in coming months, they said.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright's visit to China this month, while hailed by China as a boost to ties, would bring problems of its own if she followed through on promises to talk straight on Beijing's rights record, the diplomat said.
""If she has decided she's going to talk about human rights, the Chinese might not find it a very pleasant time,"" he said.
Washington's expected decision to back a motion condemning China for its rights policies at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva would also strain the new amity, he said.
""Those are the first few bumps that the relationship has to negotiate,"" he said.
Beijing was coming to believe that the Clinton administration was not the main source of U.S. opposition on such issues as human rights, the Chinese expert said.
""The Clinton administration doesn't want to pay more attention to the human rights issue, but it is under strong pressure from the U.S. media and Congress,"" he said.
The U.S. Congress was also the main stumbling block slowing China's entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), he said.
Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the preferential terms accorded developing nations, has long accused Washington of sabotaging its accession.
The Western diplomat said Beijing leaders were finally realising the importance of courting Congress, which China had for too long seen as no more than an equivalent of their own docile legislature.
Senior Chinese leaders have in recent weeks given visiting congressmen a warm welcome and the nation's propaganda machine has been relatively restrained in its reaction to a U.S. government report strongly critical of Beijing's rights record.
China's initially mild reaction to the report was a positive sign, the Western diplomat said. However he noted that Beijing had taken weeks to respond to a similar 1995 report and then unleashed a 7,000-word tirade blasting Washington.
Such a diplomatic broadside could still emerge to rock ties this year, but it was unlikely to be quite as long, he said.
"
MureDickie,"A state-sponsored group of Chinese academics has slammed a U.S. report that criticises Beijing for silencing dissent as a malicious and slanderous interference in China's internal affairs, official media said on Thursday.
The U.S. State Department 1997 report had violated the principles of the United Nations and ignored the progress China had made in protecting human rights, the official People's Daily quoted the scholars as concluding at a seminar in Beijing.
""The report is full of groundless accusations and intentional fabrications,"" the newspaper, mouthpiece of China's Communist Party, quoted Tian Dan of the China Society for the Study of Human Rights as saying.
""The United States government always 'reheats cold food', misleads public opinion and hopes to repeat its lies so often that they become true,"" Tian said.
The scholars' attack, which was carried by all major newspapers, was the first clear sign of Chinese anger at the January 30 U.S. report, which criticised Beijing for abusing basic freedoms and for wiping out overt political dissent.
China, which is eager to keep the momentum of the recent rapid warming in long-strained Sino-U.S. ties and has reacted with rare restraint to U.S. recent rights concerns, has yet to issue an official response to the State Department report.
All active Chinese dissidents had been jailed, detained or driven into exile in 1996, although there had been some widening of freedoms outside the political arena, the U.S. report said.
Both Washington and Beijing say relations have improved dramatically in recent months after two years of disputes over issues ranging from human rights to Taiwan to trade.
China's initially mild reaction to the U.S. report was a positive sign, but Beijing took 23 days to react to a similarily critical report last year and then unleashed a 7,000-word tirade that blasted Washington, a Western diplomat said on Thursday.
Such a diplomatic broadside could still emerge to rock ties this year, but it was unlikely to be quite as long, he said.
China's official Xinhua news agency quoted the scholars' seminar as saying the U.S. report's ""malicious and slanderous"" attack on Beijing's rights record had exposed its real aim of using the issue as an excuse to interfere in China's affairs.
The evidence provided in the report was mainly based on Western media reports, the statements of overseas pro-democracy activists and distortions of speeches of Chinese officials, Xinhua said.
Criticism over individual cases raised by Washington was factually wrong, it quoted the experts in rights, philosophy, history, law, social sciences and journalism as concluding.
The Chinese constitution had more articles on human rights protection than did the United States, while the U.S. judicial system lagged far behind in cracking down on crime and safeguarding citizens' freedoms, said Professor Dong Yunhu of the Chinese Communist Party's central academy.
""The U.S. government is not qualified to find fault with China in this respect,"" he said.
International human rights activists have long criticised China for its harsh treatment of dissent, its widespread of administrative detention without trial and its enthusiasm for executions as a means to deter rising crime.
Analysts say human rights will continue to be a major irritant in sensitive Sino-U.S. ties, despite attempts by both Washington and Beijing to ensure that the issue is not allowed to derail their recent rapprochement.

NickLouth,"Regional telephone companies reported strong fourth-quarter results Tuesday, powered by growing demand for Internet phone lines, wireless and other services like caller ID and call waiting.
While the marketplace is growing quickly, the companies' shares continue to be overshadowed by the uncertainties of head-to-head competition with long distance companies, which are hoping to gobble up major chunks of the local phone markets at the end of the year.
NYNEX Corp. said its net income grew 10 percent to $416.5 million, or 95 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $378.7 million, or 88 cents a share, in the 1995 period.
Consolidated revenue edged up 0.9 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.30 billion. It was reduced by a change in accounting for directory revenues, the assessment of prior-period service rebates and Nynex's decision not to stimulate certain markets while it was in the process of improving services.
Bell Atlantic Corp. said its profits, depressed by one-time items, fell to $346 million, or 79 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $392 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion.
Excluding one-time gains and losses, however, Bell Atlantic's operating income grew 7.3 percent to $424 million from $395 million.
""We posted strong gains in our key communications markets in 1996 as we prepare to complete our merger with NYNEX in 1997,"" said Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond W. Smith.
The two companies agreed to merge in April 1996, hoping to create a company with over $50 billion in market capitalisation. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March.
""Robust market demand for our communications products and services has produced record revenue growth and record earnings that will strengthen our competitiveness in existing markets and support our entry into significant new markets such as in-region long distance,"" Smith said.
For the year, Bell Atlantic earned $1.88 billion, or $4.28 a share, on revenue of $13.1 billion. In 1995, the company earned $1.86 billion, or $4.24 a share, on sales of $13.4 billion.
""Both Bell Atlantic and Nynex reported better than expected results compared to analysts' consensus,"" said Bill Vogel, analyst at brokers Dillon Reed.
""Bell Atlantic had a very strong and robust quarter. There were quite a few charges in the quarter, fundamental volumes of the business are at or above expectations,"" he said. ""For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth.""
SBC Communications Inc., parent of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., said its net income rose 4.8 percent to $542.9 million, or 90 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $517.8 million, or 85 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
""Our outstanding financial performance was driven by excellent results by our wireline and wireless businesses, as strong demand and effective marketing led to the addition of a total of 1.5 million customer lines during the year,"" said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief executive.
Pacific Telesis Group, with which SBC is merging, is expected to report earnings later Tuesday.
Southwestern Bell had an outstanding year, with revenues up a record 8.9 percent, compared with 5.8 percent in 1995. The growth was driven by a 9.7 percent increase in local service revenue, up from 7 percent a year ago.
Southwestern Bell added 732,000 access lines during 1996 and 156,000 during the fourth quarter, compared with 611,000 during 1995 and 149,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago, for a total of 15.0 million access lines at the end of the year.
Caller ID, one of SBC's flagship products, expanded its market penetration to nearly 37 percent.
"
NickLouth,"SBC Communications Inc said on Tuesday that soaring demand for wireless services is beating its expectations and shows no signs of slowing down in 1997.
""I'm amazed by how much momentum we have. Frankly its in advance of our business plans, and its due to both the healthy economy and an overall exploding telecom marketplace,"" SBC Chief Financial Officer Don Kiernan told Reuters.
SBC's U.S. wireless user base jumped by 20.2 percent to 4.4 million during 1996, with 739,000 customers added compared with an internal forecast of 600,000-650,000.
The company was a cent below First Call's analyst consensus with earnings per share of $0.90 for the fourth quarter compared with $0.83 a year earlier, though Kiernan said the miss was less once rounding errors were discounted.
SBC shares, which lost as much as 1/2 immediately after the results, were unchanged at $52-3/4 at 1500 EST/2000 GMT.
Wireless is providing SBC with new outlets for services like caller ID and voice dialling, which gives and extra kick to revenues in a fast growing marketplace, Kiernan said.
During 1996 1.9 million SBC wireless customers took cellular long distance, 42.5 percent of the total, which generated $60 million extra in revenues.
""As wireless customers realise its not that much more expensive to use a cellular phone to make a long distance call we could get a real windfall...,"" Kiernan said.
On top of this services such as Caller ID are a big boost to revenues and profits, first because they cost almost nothing to provide to each marginal user and because they help retain customers who might switch between providers.
""Revenue per customer in wireless is down only 1.5 percent from the prior year,"" Kiernan said. Wireless companies have come to expect bigger falls in average revenue per user as falling prices enable casual users to take a mobile phone.
Traditionally, wireless providers cope by switching to cheaper methods of acquiring new customers through retailers or resellers to offset marginal revenue declines.
But Kiernan said value-added services help support the wireless revenue curve, even as costs decline.
Already SBC reaped over $1 billion in revenues in 1996 from value-added services, mostly on the wired network.
In wired networks a new generation of software-based features would be available in mid-1997 using advanced intelligent networks (AIN), Kiernan said.
AIN means a phone or data network carries plenty of its own computing power and more information about a call than existing networks.
Desktop video conferencing is available already, but others will include call management based on information extracted from caller-ID records. Eventually many of the new features will migrate to the wireless network too.
Kiernan said that SBC had just last week started selling a package of local and long distance calling, plus local and long distance wireless under the Cellular One brand in New York state.
""We will be rolling that out in our other out-of-region markets in Chicago, Washington/Baltimore, Boston during 1997, so that will further buoy up average revenue per customer,"" he said. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))

NickLouth,"Fourth quarter results so far from the regional Bells show a breathless increase in demand across the U.S. for additional lines, wireless phones and services like caller ID. There are no signs of it slowing.
Analysts said results on Tuesday from Bell Atlantic Corp, NYNEX Corp and SBC Communications Inc generally met aggressive market expectations.
""These companies have clearly raised the bar on expectations for demand growth. It should be sustainable for 1997,"" said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber.
However, the share prices of the group continue to reflect investors worries about looming competition in the Bell's core local markets and how well they will do in long distance.
""The big issue is competition and when does that have an impact,"" Klugman said. In the meantime, booming demand continues to show up at the Bells' bottom line.
""Both Bell Atlantic and NYNEX reported better expected than results compared to analysts' consensus,"" said Bill Vogel, an analyst at brokers Dillon Reed.
SBC was a cent below the First Call consensus of $0.91 for the fourth quarter, but SBC chief financial officer Don Kiernan said that this was less when rounding errors were removed. The 1996 consensus of $3.46 was hit dead on.
""Its really much closer (to fourth quarter consensus) than it looks,"" Kiernan told Reuters.
Analysts were sanguine about SBC's performance.
""Generally SBC met aggressive expectations for revenue. Expenses were higher than we expected, but offset by a lower tax rate and a $22 million revenue boost from a regulatory change,"" said Bill Deatherage of brokers Bear Stearns.
Deatherage said the higher expenses seem to have come from Internet and data transport initiatives, investment for long distance services and Americast.
Americast is a venture with Walt Disney Co, GTE Corp, BellSouth Corp, Ameritech Corp, and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp to produce media content for interactive and multimedia networks.
Klugman said that NYNEX was pulled back a little by the relative weakness of the north eastern economy, and had reined in its marketing spending as a result of service penalties.
""I don't think they have had the opportunity to harvest the full benefits of the change in regulatory regime (to price cap from rate of return),"" he said.
However, Vogel noted that NYNEX had made a first.
""For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth,"" he said. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))

NickLouth,"Nextwave Telecommunications Inc., an ambitious newcomer among the giants of the wireless world, is to re-file for its delayed initial public offering in the next two weeks, a source close to the company said Monday.
An unknown in the industry until it began bidding in 1996's C-band Personal Communications Services (PCS) auctions, Nextwave has spent a staggering $4.7 billion on wireless licenses for the third largest network in the United States.
The company planned to go public last summer, but after a series of delays finally came to a parting with lead manager Merrill Lynch in the fall. It must now amend a required document it sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Revised documents are not yet finalised, but Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers are set to be co-lead managers of the $200 million equity offering and CIBC Wood Gundy is leading the $300 million debt offering, the source said.
Nextwave, based in San Diego, declined to comment ahead of the re-filing, and the source declined to be identified.
Nextwave's total outlay may top $8 billion, when the $3 billion to $3.5 billion cost to build the network is included.
Some analysts have been spooked by the huge debt Nextwave is taking on and see the wireless market as being dangerously overcrowded already. Nextwave, however, is sanguine.
""The company has pre-sold 35 billion network minutes of use. To put it in perspective, that is equal to the entire U.S. cellular industry's 1994 traffic,"" the source said.
While Nextwave has huge debts, it will not incur the massive advertising, marketing and customer acquisition costs incurred by its clients and their rivals as they duel in the market place for fickle customers.
The company has 21 customers, headed by MCI Communications Corp.
Nextwave is essentially offering off-the-shelf digital wireless service to any reseller that could want it.
These already include long distance and local telephone firms who need wireless to bundle with their wired offerings, other wireless firms which have holes in their own license coverage and electric utilities that see a future in telecom.
"
NickLouth,"AT&amp;T Corp's core businesses performed better in the last quarter of 1996 after struggling during much of the year, but a new problem of rising bad debts from business customers is causing analysts some concern.
""The growth in traffic volumes (3.2 percent) was better than the 2.5 percent we were expecting,"" said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. ""But they are still losing market share to the tune of three percentage points a year,"" he said.
An extra $200 million provision for uncollectible revenue dragged earnings below consensus for the fourth quarter.
AT&amp;T's operating net was $0.76 against $0.68 in the year-earlier period and adrift of the $0.79 First Call consensus of analysts. Increased provisions will now cost $100 million each quarter.
""It knocks out close to four cents a share (in earnings) going forward,"" said Klugman.
""No one was expecting that,"" said Bette Massick, an analyst at Bear Stearns. The problem is partly poorer credit profiles at businesses, plus increased bankruptcies and bad debt.
But breaches of contract and bankruptcies among the mushrooming number of long distance service resellers who use AT&amp;T's network is clearly a major problem too, analysts say.
""When a reseller goes out of business the network provider takes the hit,"" said Klugman.
AT&amp;T and other network providers are required by Federal Communication Commission rules to do business with resellers, who then compete with them for customers.
AT&amp;T said it had lowered customer turnover -- or churn -- and had maintained its market share in business services.
""Volumes in long distance was better and revenue growth better than we expected,"" said Massick.
However she said she was lowering her earnings estimate for the company for 1997 to $3.20 from $3.65 per share.
""You have to cut your number for that (the uncollectibles) alone),"" she said.
AT&amp;T seems to have overcome the worst of its problems in the credit card business where operating losses fell to $4 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million in the third quarter of 1994.
""At least it is not losing significant amounts of money any more,"" Klugman said. He added that the business was still very competitive and AT&amp;T, once a pioneer with no-fee cards, had lost its competitive edge.
AT&amp;T shares took the results in their stride, falling 7/8 to 38-1/2 by mid-afternoon, against the backdrop of a sharp fall in the broad market.
Chief Financial Officer Richard Miller said earlier that first quarter results would be comparable or slightly higher than those of the fourth quarter.
The company said it must decide how much to spend on the entry into local telephone markets and how much to spend defending its long distance markets against the regional Bells as deregulation becomes a reality later in the year. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))
"
NickLouth,"AT&amp;T Corp, after recording a $200 million rise in bad debt and uncollectibles in the fourth quarter, sees a need for an industrywide drive to crack down on customers who fail to pay their telephone bills.
""It used to be if you don't pay your phone bill, you didn't get phone service. Now with multiple suppliers, we can shut off their service, but they can go someplace else to get service,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Miller said Wednesday.  
The extra $200 million was the main reason AT&amp;T fell short of consensus estimates for the fourth quarter, analysts said.
AT&amp;T's operating net was $0.76 against $0.68 in the year-earlier period and adrift of the $0.79 First Call consensus.
""We think there are some behaviors that are beginning to emerge that we need to work on as an industry,"" Miller told Reuters in an interview.
""The majority of the problems we had in 1996 were in the business market, but we are also seeing increased uncollectibles in the consumer area,"" he said.  
There were increases in business fraud, delinquency and bankruptcies during the period, AT&amp;T said.
""We studied this in the fourth quarter and concluded we need to step up our ongoing provisioning. As we take on receivables, we allocate a certain proportion to bad debts or uncollectibles,"" he said.
""Half the $200 million was catch-up for (underprovisioning in) the past and the other represented what we were incurring in the fourth quarter,"" Miller said.  
In 1996, AT&amp;T had $9 billion of account receivables plus $7.1 billion of financial receivables. Of these it put a total $1.3 billion into allowances including uncollectibles.
Miller said the $100 million extra in the fourth quarter should be seen in the context of this overall figure.
Worldnet, AT&amp;T's Internet access service launched in 1996, ended the year with 568,000 subscribers, but added fewer in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.
""Were close to being on our plan on online services...in a brand new industry that is very dynamic that is quite remarkable,"" he said.  
He would make no predictions for when it might break even.
Miller said the company planned to market Worldnet aggressively, and the results of that effort would be seen in the first quarter.

NickLouth,"AT&amp;T Corp. is earning more, but having trouble getting paid.
The nation's largest telephone company said Wednesday that operating profits from continuing operations for the last quarter of 1996 rose 14 percent, but said it had to put aside $200 million to cover unpaid bills by customers.
The telecommunications company, which has now completed its split into three major units, said it earned $1.24 billion, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $1.09 billion, or 68 cents a share, in 1995's last quarter.
Chief financial officer Richard Miller told Wall Street analysts in a conference call that results for the first quarter of 1997 would be comparable or slightly above those of the fourth quarter.
Revenues in the latest period rose to $13.24 billion from $12.89 billion.
The Basking-Ridge, N.J.-based company's 1995 fourth-quarter operating profits excluded restructuring and other charges totalling $2.036 billion, or $1.27 a share. Including these charges, its net earnings from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $948 million, or 59 cents a share.
Competition has brought the company a new headache.
""It used to be if you don't pay your phone bill you didn't get phone service. Now with multiple suppliers, we can shut off their service, but they can go someplace else to get service,"" Miller told Reuters.
The problem is worst among business users, particularly the hundreds of tiny long-distance resellers, some of whom go bankrupt after ordering millions of network minutes from carriers like AT&amp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. in order to compete with them.
AT&amp;T's fourth-quarter operating net per share was three cents below the 79 cents industry analysts had forecast, according to First Call, mainly on the extra $200 million in provisions for bad debts.
As a result, some analysts lowered their 1997 estimates.
""No one was expecting that,"" said Bear Stearns analyst Bette Massick. ""You have to cut your number on that alone.""
For all of 1996, AT&amp;T's income from continuing operations rose to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion for 1995, excluding the charges. Earnings per share for 1996 were $3.47, a 5.5 percent increase over $3.29 per share in 1995.
Total 1996 revenues were $52.2 billion, a 3 percent increase over 1995's $50.7 billion.
""AT&amp;T had a record year in 1996 in the face of extraordinary challenges and unprecedented changes in our business and in our industry,"" said Chairman Robert E. Allen.
In September 1995, AT&amp;T said it would restructure its businesses, spinning off equipment company Lucent Technologies in September, and it completed with the spinoff of computer company NCR at the end of 1996.
AT&amp;T also sold its majority position in AT&amp;T Capital Corporation to a consortium of investors during the year.
AT&amp;T said its communications services revenue increased $529 million in the latest quarter, up 4.3 percent from the same period last year. Communications services revenues include wireline services and wireless services, as well as communications products and other services.
It said its long-distance calling volumes grew 6 percent over the same period in 1995 and 1.8 percent over the previous quarter.
""The growth in traffic volumes (3.2 percent) was better than the 2.5 percent we were expecting,"" said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. ""But they are still losing market share to the tune of three percentage points a year,"" he said.
AT&amp;T's wireless services revenue, which includes cellular voice and data, messaging and air-to-ground services, grew 18.4 percent to $937 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. Its cellular service subscribers grew to 5.2 million, a 31.7 percent increase from a year ago.
Revenues from communications products and other services, which include consulting and outsourcing, on-line, and wireless product sales, were $386 million, an increase of nearly 17 percent from the year-ago quarter.
However, credit card revenue plunged 32.3 percent to $374 million, primarily as a result of the securitization programme instituted at AT&amp;T Universal Card Services in 1995.
Credit card operating losses fell to $4 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million in the third quarter of 1996. In 1995's fourth quarter, it made an operating profit of $109 million.
AT&amp;T's stock closed 50 cents down at $38.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

NickLouth,"BellSouth Corp on Thursday produced another set of strong earnings, with fourth quarter figures one cent above consensus, and extremely strong access line growth and cellular customer expansion.
Analysts note BellSouth has done this on a lean cost base, aided by a conservative approach to expensive projects like Personal Communications Services (PCS), and futuristic broadband networks.
""They did report a penny better than expectations,"" said Lind Meltzer, an analyst at UBS Securities.
The company boosted earnings per share before one-off items by 12.3 percent to $0.64, from $0.57 a year ago. The First Call consensus was $0.63.
""I think their double digit earnings growth is sustainable,"" said Barry Sine, an analyst at SBC Warburg, though he was less confident that growth would continue at 12-13 percent as had been seen.
Total operating revenues rose six percent to $5.05 billion from $4.76 billion in the fourth quarter and operating expenses rose 5.7 percent, excluding year ago charges.
Preparing for entry into long distance and to defend the local calling market from new rivals is a challenge to costs, but BellSouth is so far doing well.
""Just holding the line on margins is an achievement, and they managed to expand a little,"" said Sine.
BellSouth only bid for PCS licenses to fill in gaps of its regional cellular coverage while some other Bells banded together to build a national network.
Analysts also applaud its 'wait and see' approach to the information superhighway, which has been more broadly adopted by phone companies after technological and marketing setbacks.
""They have been proved right,"" Sine said.
Access line growth over BellSouth's huge and economically buoyant region was 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. This was below the third quarter's 4.9 percent and the 5.0 of the second quarter.
""We're not sure how much of this decline is secular, and how much is related to the (second quarter strength) from the Atlanta Olympics,"" Sine said.
""Volume growth at BellSouth did look a little weak considering they are normally at the high end of the regional Bells,"" Meltzer said.
SBC Communications Inc and Ameritech Corp each recently reported some moderation in line growth.
In Ameritech's case this is a deliberate cut back in marketing because second lines have a long payback period, particularly when used for linking computers to the Internet which does not generate access revenues, analysts have said.
BellSouth telephone operations cash expenses rose 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago.
""They have got some room to go on costs as they came to cost-cutting a little later than some,"" Sine said.
BellSouth its employees per 10,000 access lines had fallen to 28.2 from 32.5 a year ago, a measure of productivity improvements.
The stock closed 1-1/2 lower at 42-3/8 as the broad market fell. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))
"
NickLouth,"AT&amp;T Corp is hoping to use its new local calling service for businesses to take valuable customers away from regional Bell competitors, appealing to those that want a single bill for a package of services.
Jeff Weitzen, executive vice president for AT&amp;T business markets, said that while the company would initially provide local service by reselling the networks of local phone companies, many customers would soon be found valuable enough to get their own AT&amp;T digital line.  
""In essence what we announced today was only our launching pad,"" Weitzen told Reuters in an interview on Monday.
AT&amp;T announced two services designed to make further inroads in the business calling markets where it already reaps $20 billion of annual revenue.
AT&amp;T Business Local Service, aimed at those who spend less than $2,500 per month, offers local calling on a single bill with any other AT&amp;T service. It is being launched in California on February 3, with other states to follow.  
The second, AT&amp;T Digital Link, offers outbound local calling in 35 states over existing digital lines. AT&amp;T will install its own lines to customers spending more than $2,500 a month, making it easier to offer high-speed data, Internet and other services.
By the end of February, Digital Link, which has been tested with 2,500 customers, will be available in 45 states.
Weitzen hopes to bring customers aboard with the first offer, use a package to calculate what they spend, then pull them across to the more profitable second offering.  
""A large number of customers don't have digital facilities, but when you bundle up the various offerings, they take will cross that ($2,500) line rather quickly,"" he said.
By the end of this year, Business Local Service will be offered across large parts of the country using the circuits of regional Bells under resale agreements, most of which are still under negotiation.
For the moment AT&amp;T only has a resale deal with Pacific Telesis Group for California and is close to finalizing one with Ameritech Corp.  
AT&amp;T's California coverage plans are hindered by the lack of an agreement with GTE Corp, which has several calling regions in California.
Also by the end of this year, a third version of Digital Link software will allow users to cut out regional Bells completely from both inbound and outbound calling, with even 911 emergency calls and local directory-assistance calls being handled via AT&amp;T.
As part of that upgrade, AT&amp;T will need to pass regulatory hurdles in the states concerned.
"
NickLouth,"Ameritech Corp is confident that it has a three-part strategy to keep its earnings growth intact even when new competitors enter its midwest region in force later this year in search of new customers.
The Chicago-based regional Bell has strengthened its core local calling business, moved to enter new businesses like cable TV and security which add value to the network, and sought out profitable niches abroad.
""The beauty is we started these strategies three years ago and they work,"" said Chief Executive Richard Notebaert.
Over lunch in a Manhattan restaurant, Notebaert told Reuters that the costs of fighting new competitors would be significant, but would not seriously hinder growth.
""Will it affect us? Yes. Will it takes us below double digit earnings growth? I don't think so,"" he said.
While some Bells have sought safety and market strength in mergers, Notebaert said Ameritech had not so far found any business combinations that met the acid test.
""We haven't seen anything that would add value for shareholders,"" he said, declining to give details.
Ameritech has taken an individual path in its core business by pushing software calling features like call-waiting and caller ID -- which are very profitable -- instead of extra lines which may not be so profitable.
""We just stopped stimulating it (demand)"" he said, adding that growth in lines had fallen to 3.5 percent a year from 4.5 percent when new lines were actively marketed.
New lines have a very long payback when cable reinforcement is needed in the street, Notebaert said. The additional revenue may be small, especially if the line is used solely for a facsimile machine or Internet usage.
Ameritech also struck out alone in its foray into the security business, which concentrates on remote monitoring of premises. The company bought SecurityLink in 1994 and National Guardian in 1995 and now has 367,000 users, mostly businesses of which 78 percent are outside its home region.
""We are number two in the U.S. and we need to be number one,"" Notebaert said.
Ameritech, which is licensed to offer long distance services in 42 states, has considered using its security  customer base as a launching pad to sell other telecom services outside its region, Notebaert said.
Ameritech has quietly become a force in cable TV, offering service in 20 of 32 franchises it owns in its local region.
The programming is supplied by Americast, which Ameritech owns with BellSouth Corp, SBC Communications, Walt Disney Co, GTE Corp and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp.
Ameritech is shy about revealing cable TV customer numbers. It would only say they number tens of thousands. Of customers approached, 25 percent have taken the service.
The offering is typical of Ameritech's down to earth approach. Notebaert has shied away from futuristic services when it is not clear what the market will support.
""Everyone who went into interactive and multimedia lost their shirts,"" Notebaert said.
Ameritech powered 30 percent of its earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 1996 came from overseas investments, which includes stakes in companies in New Zealand, Hungary, Belgium, Norway and Germany.
""We could have done much more, but we didn't want to take our eye off the ball at home,"" Notebaert said. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))1

NickLouth,"MCI Communications Corp's increased focus on high value customers has produced real results in the last quarter of 1996, positioning the company well for the impending market fight with regional Bells.
""Normally I take strategic position shifts with a pinch of salt, but you can really see it in this quarter's MCI numbers,"" said Richard Klugman of PaineWebber
MCI, which reported results earlier on Tuesday, expanded long distance revenues by 10 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, ahead of volume growth of eight percent.  
This reverses the normal position for long distance companies, which have tended to get less revenue for each average minute used on their system year by year.
""You are seeing a favorable gap (revenue growth minus volume growth),"" Klugman said. ""Part is the price increases around Thanksgiving, but part is the data services,"" he said.
Data services are high value services, and are not billed on a minute basis.
MCI said that it had increased average revenue per customer, cut the proportion of customers leaving for other carriers and built a more effective base for the future.  
""We are far more selective about customers going forward,"" MCI Chief Financial Offier Doug maine told Reuters.
To push this process along MCI is aligning the pay of its sales people with the overall value rather than number of customers. The start of MCI One, a package of services on one bill, has helped that process, he said.
""They did what they said they would do and increased the focus in the long distance business on higher value customers,"" said Barry Sine, an analyst at SBC Warburg.
Analysts are expecting a substantial increase in MCI's spending this year for marketing the expansion into local calling. MCI is sticking with its guidance to analysts to expect flat earnings per share for the year, they said.
MCI is in the process of merging with British Telecommunications Plc. MCI stock was 1/4 firmer at 34-5/8 by midsession. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))

NickLouth,"MCI Communications Corp on Wednesday said it developed a new network type called Vault which combines conventional voice telephone networks with packet-switched networks like the Internet on a single line.
MCI said the cost is part of the $100 million a year it is spending on upgrading its Internet networks. The company plans to earn $2 billion a year in Internet revenues by the end of the century.
""It can be done over a conventional phone line,"" MCI Chief Engineering Officer Fred Briggs told Reuters.
For example the technology will allow a customer to talk to and receive computer data from an MCI service representative simultaneously on a single, conventional telephone line by turning the voice into data packets.
""We have been working on this for months,"" Briggs said. He declined to say whether MCI had patented the technology.
Customers currently need separate lines to communicate over a telephone network and a packet-switched network.
Packet switching means that traffic is divided into manageable chunks and labelled for its ultimate destination. It will be sent via the most convenient route, while conventional phone calls can only travel the route set in advance.
Packet switching has a network efficiency benefit. It is the difference between diverting cars away from city congestion and not being able to do the same to bypass a breakdown on the subway.
""From a customer's perspective, communications will be simplified.  The issue of which network a communication travels over will be irrelevant,"" said MCI President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Price.
MCI is already using Vault technology to provide enhanced features to its directlineMCI product by allowing customers to update their account profiles via the World Wide Web.
MCI plans to add products suitable for vault in areas like intranet managed services, facsimile, document sharing, video conferencing and communications management. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))

NickLouth,"Global One, a telecommunications venture owned by Sprint Corp., Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom, lost more money than expected in 1996 and is poised to cut jobs, two sources close to the company said Wednesday.
The venture set up in January last year was expected to lose $250 million for 1996 but has in fact lost almost $370 million, one source close to the venture told Reuters.
""The partners are furious about the losses. Word has come down that they are looking to cut jobs,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified.
Neither Global One nor Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint, which owns a 33 percent stake in the group, would comment.
It was not immediately possible to contact Deutsche Telekom or France Telecom which share the remaining 67 percent. However, a second source, close to one of the partners later confirmed the accuracy of the story.
Current analyst expectations are of losses of up to $250 million, of which around $85 million would be attributable to Sprint and $51 million of that has already been recorded in the first nine months.
Sprint is planning to report fourth quarter results on Feb. 4 and First Call's analyst consensus of fourth quarter earnings has already slipped in recent days to 69 cents per share from 70 cents, compared to a year ago 79 cents, when Sprint posted a net profit of $278 million, excluding one-time charges.
Analysts say much depends on the proportion of the loss attributable to Sprint, the tax effects, and how the partners account for it, but it will clearly hit earnings per share.
""If this is true, Global One's effect on Sprint will jump up from per share losses of 2-4 cents per quarter in the first nine months to in excess of 10 cents in the fourth quarter,"" said Bill Deatherage of Bear Stearns.
Global One currently has 2,900 employees and has been spending heavily to build a network powerful enough for it to carry traffic for other telecom firms as well as to cater to the global needs of large businesses.
The partners have revealed no financial details about Global One's performance in 1996 except to say it is expected to end the year with more than $800 million of orders.

NickLouth,"Citizens Utilities Co. said on Thursday it is aiming to be among the largest eight or 10 U.S. telephone companies by the year 2000 by buying up companies in small but important local telephone markets across the country.
""We are looking at acquisitions of this type every day,"" Ronald Spears, vice president for Citizens' telecom business, told Reuters.
Citizens, currently the 15th-largest U.S. phone company, is looking for new properties on both the western and eastern seaboards, particularly in the South and Southwest, where people are already concentrated or are expected to move.
The Stamford, Conn.-based company is a big stakeholder in wireless telephone firm Centennial Cellular Corp. and owns Electric Lightwave Inc., which provides telecommunications services in five western cities.
To facilitate the growth it needs, Citizens is seeking regulatory changes in the markets where it is the incumbent local phone company, hoping to encourage competitors to come in.
""We want to bring the benefits of a competitive market to customers in the second and third tier markets ..."" he said.
Citizens was to file with New York state regulators Thursday to request price cap regulation for the 250,000 customers it has in upstate New York instead of a cap on its rate of return.
Citizens acquired the business in this area from GTE Corp. in 1993.
If approved, Citizens will also change its New York rate structure, merging local calling areas and making wholesale rates on its network more attractive for new market entrants in a plan it has dubbed ""Customer Wins"".
At the moment it is regulated with a cap on its rate of return, which discourages efficiencies because savings have to be shared with customers.
Price caps instead allow companies to keep their cost savings so long as they meet price targets.
While most regional Bells are being accused of dragging their feet over competition, why would Citizens want to encourage rivals to snare its customers?
The difference, Spears says, is in the type of markets. ""The introduction of competition should stimulate demand in these markets, which is historically what happens,"" he said.
Spears said Citizens would get 85 percent of the revenues as a wholesaler, compared with 100 percent as a retailer -- but the market would be larger and grow more quickly.
Already about 20 companies, mainly cellular telephone providers, are lining up to talk to Citizens about interconnection and resale agreements.
The process is being played out in other parts of the country. Citizens has already moved to price cap regulation in California, Tennessee and West Virginia, and plans to do so in the remaining eight states where it operates as soon as possible.
Citizens Utilities' revenues in the first half of 1996 were up 25 percent at $647 million, with telecommunications the main engine of growth.
This year telecom will account for 65 percent of revenue, and in 1997 near 70 percent, with electricity, natural gas and waste water services taking the rest. Telecom operating margins are a healthy 30-33 percent of revenues.
""We're taking a very aggressive posture for what has been recognised historically as a small independent telephone company,"" Spears said.

NickLouth,"Global One says its shareholders are pleased the venture was able to establish itself in a tough market in year one and are not judging it by its losses in 1996.
Global One was set up in January 1995 by Sprint Corp, Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom to provide global telecom services to multinational firms and carry other telecom firms.  
""They are very pleased they could establish Global One as a strong global carrier in year one,"" said Klaus Czerwinski, vice president of corporate communications at Global One.
Sources close to Global One told Reuters last week the venture had lost almost $370 million in 1996, when only $250 million had been expected.
Czerwinski declined to say how much Global One had lost in total during 1996, saying no figure would be finalised until the venture closes its books, probably in the next two weeks, and even then would not be made public.  
""All I can say is that we did have losses in 1996,"" he told Reuters.
Sprint took $62 million in charges for Global One losses in 1996, $22.1 million of it in the fourth quarter when some earlier spending decisions had to be ""trued-up,"" or reconciled with actual outlays.
The long distance carrier owns a third of the European part of Global One and half the non-European part. The European carriers each own a third of the European operation and a quarter of the non-European operation.  
Sources close to Global One last week said that unexpectedly higher losses had led to threats of job cuts, but Czerwinski was not aware of any being planned.
""The clear truth is that there are no decisions yet,"" he said.
Asked about the shareholders reactions to overall cost levels he said: ""There are things they are more happy with and things they are less happy with....But they do not judge us in year one.""
Sources close to Sprint said on Tuesday the complexities of contributing operations from three different corporations from different accounting and linguistic backgrounds would make it hard to control first year costs.
""There are certain things you can only find out at the end of the year,"" the source said, declining to be identified.
However, these are no expected to be persistent problems the source said.

NickLouth,"Fourth quarter results from Sprint Corp showed extremely strong growth in the core long distance and local phone businesses, but earnings trailed consensus estimates because of dilution from new ventures.
""I was pretty pleased. It continues to show strong core growth offset by increased dilution from new ventures,"" said Simon Flannery, an analyst at J.P. Morgan.
Sprint's volume of business in long distance jumped 20 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, and operating margins improved.  
Local calling was less outstanding, analysts said, but included a 5.6 percent increase in lines to customers and a 40 percent increase in revenues for smart phone features like Caller ID and voice dialling.
""The core business was an absolute blow-out,"" said Michael Elling of Prudential Securities.
The stock rose 1/2 to 40-3/4 by midsession.
""Investors continue to focus on the strong core growth and the prospects of the emerging businesses,"" said Flannery.  
Sprint is now gearing up to add thousands of PCS and Internet subscribers in 1997, when its vision of a package of services on one bill should reach fruition.
Sprint produced $0.57 earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with a loss of $0.98 a year ago. Analysts added  back an $0.08 charge for comparison with their projections, reaching $0.65 in the quarter.
That was four cents below their consensus of $0.69 carried on First Call, which already assumed considerable dilution from new ventures like Personal Communications Services (PCS) wireless and Global One.  
""That four cents could be placed at the feet of one product, the Internet roll-out,"" said Elling.
Global One, an international venture jointly owned with Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom, cost Sprint $0.05 a share in 1996's fourth quarter up from $0.02 a year ago, but costs should decline from now on, analysts said.
""The true-up at Global One seemed to be worth about two cents per share,"" Flannery said, referring to a fourth quarter catch up to costs incurred earlier.  
Sources close to Global One last week told Reuters that the venture had racked up almost $370 million of losses in 1996 instead of $250 million budgeted. Neither Sprint nor Global One would confirm these figures.
The venture serves multinational firms telecom needs and carries traffic for other telecom firms.
The cost of all the new ventures was around 20 cents to Sprint in the fourth quarter, according to Richard Klugman, an analyst at PaineWebber.  
""You will not see the return on these (investments) until 1999 at the earliest,"" said Klugman. However, like other analysts polled he backed the company's strategy. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))

NickLouth,"BellSouth Corp, seeing regional Bells merging around it, feels no pressure to seek a merger itself and sees little value in other deals so far.
""We haven't seen a compelling value proposition in any of the mergers so far,"" chief financial officer Ron Dykes told Reuters.
Dykes said there were few efficiencies in neighboring Bells merging and buying long distance assets was even less attractive.  Competing with Internet service providers was easier and better than paying a premium to buy one.  
As for vertical takeovers, like home security, financial services, software or other firms which are big customers for communications facilities, Dykes was even more blunt.
""It is hard to merge a cat with a dog,"" he said.
By this he meant BellSouth would be much less sure of its footing in a business where it does not have expertise, and management cultures would be very different.
Dykes believes that filling out service provision in BellSouth's huge nine-state region and building franchises for individual businesses is the best way to succeed in the competitive landscape sketched by the 1996 Telecom Act.  
Others have different ideas.
Neighbors Bell Atlantic Corp and NYNEX Corp decided to merge, as did SBC Communications Inc and Pacific Telesis Group, while Ameritech Corp has expanded into home security.
Some analysts believe there are attractive bid targets for regional Bells in the long distance industry, but Dykes said BellSouth doesn't want to own assets of declining value.
""With long distance you are looking at an industry where prices are at their peak.  The same would be true of buying a second tier long distance company,"" he said.  
Dykes believes that long distance rates will fall sharply as companies like BellSouth enter the industry, especially as so much wholesale capacity is for sale.
BellSouth has a deal to use AT&amp;T Corp's network to provide long distance service and expects to be serving customers in at least two states in its region by year-end.
Firms like WorldCom Inc have acquired Internet service providers (ISP's), but Dykes says it is unnecessary.
""In our view it is cheaper to steal the customer than pay for them (by buying an ISP),"" he said.  He said that BellSouth already had tens of thousands of Internet customers.  
""By the end of 1997 we believe we will be the largest Internet service provider in the South,"" he predicted.
BellSouth has worked hard to fill out its wireless coverage, adding new licenses in Federal Personal Communications Services (PCS) auctions earlier this year to its existing PCS and cellular licenses.
It has also bought licenses in other areas in order to swap them for licenses held by other firms in its home region.
On Wednesday it finalised such a deal with a unit of Telephone and Data Systems Inc, trading its interests in 12 licenses in Wisconsin and Illinois for 23 owned by TDS in the South, plus receiving an undisclosed cash sum.
In addition the company has bought licenses for wireless cable which allow it to beam microwave TV signals by line of sight to the homes of viewers. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))

NickLouth,"A number of top executives in the telecommunications industry are abandoning the comforts of giant corporations for the thrills of building a new company and the hope of becoming seriously wealthy in the process.
""I think this is not for everybody,"" said Alex Mandl, who on Monday resigned as chief operating officer of AT&amp;T Corp. to become chairman of Associated Communications, a tiny new company in the crowded arena of wireless services.
""It requires a willingness to step out of the comfort zone of big Corporate America,"" Mandl said in an interview.
New technology and a new era of competition are giving executives with key skills huge opportunities in new ventures, even as thousands of others are losing their jobs.
Small companies with good technology can now beat established giants thanks to opportunities from the auction of new wireless licenses and the convergence of communications, computers and entertainment.
Mandl is not the first. In January 1995 Jim Barksdale left AT&amp;T wireless, where he was chief executive, to become president and chief executive of the then-obscure Netscape Communications Corp..
Across the technology field, start-ups have claimed Silicon Graphics Inc.  President Thomas Jermoluk, Dataquest Inc. Chief Executive Judy Hamilton, Sybase Inc. Chief Operating Officer David Peterschmidt and many others.
George Schmitt was chief executive of PCS PrimeCo, a national wireless venture where he had billions to spend building an advanced communications network for a group of regional Bells. Yet in August last year he took a half-million dollar pay cut to join little-known Omnipoint Corp.
What the recruiters expect is clear -- a winning market strategy, a star to attract a top management team and the use of wide industry contracts to minimize chances of failure.
The companies the executives leave usually recover, but can often take some short-term damage to their stock as investors try to work out the motivation for departure.
AT&amp;T's stock fell $1.375 on Monday to $54.125 on news of Mandl's resignation. It added 12.5 cents Tuesday.
As well as the big names, hundreds of vice presidents and middle-ranking executives have left long-distance firms and regional Bells to work for new companies in the industry.
Many have tough decisions to make, trading in long hours and a comfortable if pedestrian salary progression for a crack at serious wealth -- but with hours only workaholics would enjoy.
""It is the opportunity to shape something risky, but a lot more satisfying,"" said consultant Mark Bruneau of COBA-MID.
Of course not even the big companies are so safe anymore. Greater competition and rapidly evolving technology are erasing the comfort zone for all but a few.
AT&amp;T is cutting tens of thousands of jobs as part of its split into three parts, as are the regional Bells, who will soon be fighting head to head with AT&amp;T in many markets.
In Mandl's case, it was an offer too good to refuse.
A $20 million signing bonus in cash to join Associated removes any personal worries should the new company fail, and dwarfs his AT&amp;T salary of around $1.3 million.
""Most of the other opportunities are stock rich, not cash rich like this,"" said Bette Massick of brokers Bear Stearns.
Should Associated succeed wildly, then Mandl's share options, which convert to an 18 percent stake in the company, should provide still greater comfort.
Nevertheless, it could not have been an easy decision. Mandl, 52, was considered by analysts as heir apparent to AT&amp;T Chairman Robert Allen.
Mandl declined to speculate whether his decision would have been the same if Allen were to retire this year instead of in three or four years.
""He (Allen) was always consistent that I was a good candidate to succeed him, but beyond that you have to earn your stripes,"" Mandl said.
Netscape's Barksdale is pure inspiration for risk takers.
""Barksdale had a terrific job at AT&amp;T. He could have been a candidate for the top job,"" Mandl said.
But now even Robert Allen must dream about being as wealthy as Barksdale.
Netscape, a dominant force in the world of Web browsers for the Internet, was a roaring success after its initial public offering a year ago. Barksdale has sold 2.2 million Netscape shares, but his remaining six million shares are now worth a cool $222 million.

PatriciaCommins,"Interstate Bakeries Corp chairman Charles Sullivan said Thursday he backs analysts' earnings estimates of $0.35-$0.40 a share for the company's third quarter. (Corrects timeframe from fiscal 1997)
""We told them (analysts) we're not uncomfortable with that,"" Sullivan said in an interview here after a presentation at an analysts' conference.  
In the year ago third quarter, the company earned $0.11 a share.
Sullivan said the anticipated growth in third quarter earnings reflects reduced costs, higher revenues and increased sales of branded products.
Interstate, the largest baker and distributor of fresh bakery products in the United States has brands including Wonder, Hostess and Dolly Madison.  
Moving forward, Interstate said it plans to extend those brand lines with new products, seeking to appeal to children with offerings like bubble gum flavored mini muffins and to adults with improved low fat Hostess Twinkies.
Interstate also began rolling out last month a fat-free Wonder bread, which it expects will appeal to an older consumer.
The company is also looking to extend its reach in the United States, looking for acquisitions in a consolidating industry.
Sullivan said Interstate plans to acquire an existing bakery operation, west of the Mississippi River. He would provide no other details.
That deal would help offset lost revenue from government-ordered divestitures after Interstate's 1995 purchase of Continental Baking Co, he said.

PatriciaCommins,"Wm. Wrigley Jr Co said Thursday it is looking for ways to help revitalize the domestic chewing gum market, which saw about a one percent drop in physical sales volume in 1996.
""We have to bring new news to the category...either in advertising, merchandising (or) improved products,"" William Piet, vice president of corporate affairs and corporate secretary, said in an interview after a presentation at an analysts' conference here.  
Piet cautioned that last year's decline in the overall domestic chewing gum market does not signal ""a disaster,"" adding that the industry has been growing at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent.
""It's a knock on the door,"" Piet said of the decline.
Despite the decline in the domestic market, Wrigley's chewing gum brands at the end of 1996 surpassed about a 50 percent market share, up a little more than one point.  
North America accounts for roughly 46 percent of Wrigley's business, but Wrigley continues to grow overseas. This year it will add Cambodia to the list of some 120 countries where it sells products. Cambodia will be supplied out of a new replacement factory in the Philippines, along with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
Wrigley also plans to begin construction this spring for a new factory in Russia. That plant, which was previously announced, is expected to be in operation in early 1999.
With the Russia facility, Wrigley will have plants in 13 countries outside the United States.
Piet said growth in the international market varies from year to year, but said over 10 years the growth rate has been about four times that of the domestic market.

PatriciaCommins,"The worst may be over for Quaker Oats Co's Snapple beverage business, which has posted operating losses for the two years since it was acquired for $1.8 billion.
""I suppose Snapple has declined all that it is going to decline,"" Robert Cummins, managing director of Schroder Wertheim, said on Thursday.
To be sure, Quaker still faces challenges to recover the hefty investment it made in the Snapple iced tea and fruit-flavor beverage business.  
""To get the return on this investment, they still have a long way to go,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez said.
Quaker Chairman William Smithburg, speaking to reporters in Naples, Florida, after a presentation at an analyst conference, again acknowledged that Snapple had been a disappointment. Snapple's sale volume declined in 1996 from the previous year, and it posted an operating loss before amortization.
For 1997, Smithburg reiterated that he expected a turnaround for Snapple, promising to an end to operating losses.  
""We believe the business can be stabilized and run for positive cash,"" Smithburg said.
Being cash positive means Snapple would post a profit after amortization costs.
Smithburg declined to give a sales projection for Snapple in 1997. Analysts have said previously that flat sales and reduced costs would help the beverage line break even this year.  
""At least they'll ebb the bleeding,"" said SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik, who expects Snapple to break even this year.
Disappointing results at Snapple have prompted speculation that Quaker might look to get rid of the business. Quaker has been rumored to be shopping Snapple around to prospective buyers.
Smithburg declined to comment on any rumors or potential merger and acquisition activity.
But he reiterated that Quaker would continue to ""evaluate all options for the business.""  
""The first order of business is to run it better,"" Smithburg said.
He said the company had improved Snapple's distribution system and planned more aggressive promotion of the Diet Snapple line, which enjoyed a 20 percent rise in sales in 1996 and gains of 30 percent during the last four months.

PatriciaCommins,"Ralcorp Holdings Inc, which cut itself in half through recent divestitures, is trying to slash costs to return its cereal business to profitability by next year while scouting for possible acquisitions.
""We want to continue to grow internally and opportunistically,"" Joe Micheletto, president, said in an interview here after making a presentation at an analysts conference.  
But for Ralcorp, which was spun off by Ralston Purina Co in March 1994, recent moves have continued to make the company smaller, not bigger.
Last month, it completed the sale of its branded cereal and snack business to General Mills Inc in a $570 million deal. That left Ralcorp with annual cereal sales of $274 million from private-label -- or grocery store brand -- cereal only, down from $660 million.
That sale also left Ralcorp with an infrastructure that is too large for the pared-back business.  
The plan now is to make cutbacks to return cereal to profitability in fiscal 1998, Micheletto said.
""For us to realize the full potential of our industry-leading position in private label cereal, we must first correct this imbalance in our cost structure,"" Micheletto said in the text of a speech given to analysts.
As previously reported, Ralcorp will take a $20 million charge in its second quarter related to staff cuts and other costs.  
The sale of the branded business, which included the Chex cereal line, was precipitated by intense price competition that put the squeeze on that line's profits.
""It was more valuable in someone else's hands than in ours,"" added Patrick Farrell, vice president of investor and public relations for Ralcorp.
Ralcorp also sold its ski resort operation in a $310 million deal to Vail Resorts Inc on January 3. Ralcorp holds a 22.7 percent stake in Vail, which the company may keep or sell, depending on what generates the most shareholder value, Micheletto said.
Debt-free and with an expected $15 million to $20 million in cash from accounts receivable, Ralcorp is looking to grow its remaining businesses, which also include private label crackers and cookies and Beech-Nut baby food, he added.
Ralcorp will be looking for acquisitions, likely in grain- based products, with an emphasis on private label products.
""We will strike when the iron is hot, if that's a year from now or six months or now or tomorrow,"" Micheletto said.

PatriciaCommins,"ReliaStar Financial Corp. said Monday it would acquire Security-Connecticut Corp. in a stock exchange deal worth $488 million, including debt.
Minneapolis-based ReliaStar said the deal, which values Security-Connecticut Corp. of Avon, Conn., at $47 a share, will broaden the insurance products sold by both firms.
""We identified Security-Connecticut as a company that was positioned in the market with both product lines and distribution that fit very well with ours. They were strong where we weren't so strong, and we had products that we were sure their distribution chain could sell,"" ReliaStar Chairman John Turner said in a telephone interview.
Based on Friday's closing price of $59.25 for ReliaStar common stock, Security-Connecticut stockholders would receive 0.7932 of a share of ReliaStar common stock for each share of Security-Connecticut common stock.
The transaction, valued at $488 million, includes ReliaStar's assumption of $75 million of Security-Connecticut debt, the companies said.
The combined company would have assets under management of $19.9 billion and $241.4 billion of life insurance in force, making it the nation's 11th largest life insurance company.
Following the news, Security-Connecticut's stock jumped $8 to $45.50 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while ReliaStar dropped 50 cents to $58.75, also on the NYSE.
ReliaStar said the merger was expected to result in at least $7 million in annual pretax cost reductions. Another $2 million may be saved with the planned consolidation of ReliaStar's and Security-Connecticut's New York operations, Turner added.
Turner said some jobs were expected to be eliminated as a result of the deal but added that the number had not been determined. ReliaStar employes about 3,500 people and Security-Connecticut about 400.
ReliaStar expects to reap the main benefit of the deal in its revenues.
""The big payoff is in the cross-selling,"" Turner said.
For example, ReliaStar has variable life and annuity products that expand Security-Connecticut's offerings. Security-Connecticut has second-to-die life insurance policies, which cover two people such as a husband and wife, and term life products that complement ReliaStar.
""Cross-selling works best when products and distribution are complementary and not redundant,"" Dain Bosworth analyst J. Chris Sergeant said in a phone interview. ""It's set up to be successful.""
""I think it's a good deal,"" Nutmeg Securities analyst Ira Zuckerman said. ""ReliaStar picked up an excellent marketing operation.""
ReliaStar Financial provides individual life insurance and annuities, employee benefits, reinsurance, retirement plans and mutual fund services. Security-Connecticut specialises in life insurance and annuity products sold through independent general agents nationwide.
After the close of the merger, Security-Connecticut's two subsidiaries, Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. and Lincoln Security Life Insurance Co., will become part of ReliaStar Financial, the companies said.
""ReliaStar and Security-Connecticut are a perfect complement to each other in both products and distribution,"" Security-Connecticut Chairman Ronald Jarvis said in a statement.
Jarvis will continue to serve as chief executive of Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. and will be a member of the boards of ReliaStar Life Insurance and ReliaStar Bankers Security Life Insurance, two wholly owned units of ReliaStar Financial Corp. He also will be part of the ReliaStar Management Committee.
The deal is subject, among other things, to approval by Security-Connecticut stockholders.
ReliaStar said that, as part of the deal, it would issue some 7 million additional shares of common stock, but the actual number of shares to be issued would be determined when the transaction is completed. ReliaStar also proposed buying back up to $100 million in its stock as part of the transaction.
"
PatriciaCommins,"ReliaStar Financial Corp chairman John Turner said Monday his company's $488 million merger deal with Security-Connecticut Corp would broaden the insurance products sold by both firms.

They were strong where we weren't so strong, and we had products that we were sure their distribution chain could sell,"" Turner said in a telephone interview.  
The merger of the two companies in a stock-for-stock transaction, which values Security-Connecticut at $47 a share, is expected to result in at least $7.0 million in annual pretax cost reductions.
Another $2.0 million may be saved with the planned consolidation of ReliaStar's and Security-Connecticut's New York operations, Turner added.
But ReliaStar expects to reap the main benefit of the deal on its top line.
""The big payoff is in the cross-selling,"" Turner said.  
For example, Minneapolis-based ReliaStar has variable life and annuity products that expand Security-Connecticut's offerings. Avon, Conn.-based Security-Connecticut has second-to-die universal life and term life products, which cover two lives, that complement ReliaStar.
""Cross-selling works best when products and distribution are complementary and not redundant,"" Dain Bosworth analyst J. Chris Sergeant. ""It's set up to be successful.""
Turner said the deal will not hurt earnings in 1997 and will be ""a little accretive"" in 1998, which also reflects a planned $100 million share buyback of ReliaStar stock.  
Security-Connecticut shares were up eight at 45-1/2 at midday, reflecting the offer price.
""I think it's a good deal,"" Nutmeg Securities analyst Ira Zuckerman said. ""ReliaStar picked up an excellent marketing operation.""
ReliaStar shares were off 1/4 at 59, which Sergeant said reflects the near-term neutral earnings impact.
""The stock has done very well already,"" he said.
One advantage for Security-Connecticut in the deal is gaining access to a stronger balance sheet to back up the claims paying ability of its life insurance operation. That, Sergeant said, opens the potential for an upgrade by ratings agencies.
Turner said the Security-Connecticut deal fits its criterion of a 16 percent return on equity and will not derail its goal of a 13 percent increase in earnings per share.
""What we say is we intend to attain (these goals) without acquisitions, but we also readily recognize that consolidation is occurring in our industry,"" he added.
After the Security-Connecticut deal, ReliaStar would become the 11th largest publicly held life insurance holding company in the United States.

PatriciaCommins,"McDonald's Corp. just turned up the heat in the fast-food business.
If franchisees go along with the plan, the world's largest restaurant chain will launch its biggest nationwide promotion ever, featuring 55-cent sandwiches, down from about $1.95 for a Big Mac, according to franchisee sources.
The plan is a bold stept to lure customers into McDonald's restaurants in the face of intense competition in the nation's giant fast-food industry.
McDonald's, which has more than 20,000 units worldwide and more than 12,000 in the United States, declined to give specifics on its plan. Spokesman Jack Daly said the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company hopes to launch a ""national value-price promotion.""
Pointing to a current promotion on Chicken McNugget sandwiches, which analysts said has helped McDonald's build sales this month, Daly said, ""It's in that same spirit.""
Charles Gonzales, a McDonald's franchisee with two units in the San Francisco area, said the nationwide promotion would feature a different sandwich for 55 cents each month when a customer buys french fries and a drink at the regular price.
The promotion, he added, is expected to start with the Big Mac hamburger, which is usually priced between $1.90 and $1.99, and will include breakfast sandwiches as well, he said.
But the promotion, to be presented to franchisees on Thursday, could spark a price war, analysts said. That prospect worried investors who drove fast-food stocks sharply lower.
""Everyone will have something for 55 cents. Now it's a zero-sum game again,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok.
But Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, may not match McDonald's price promotions right away.
""There are a lot of things (companies can do) to enhance value without directly cutting prices,"" Adelman said, including increasing the frequency of regular promotions.
Earlier, Burger King said it had no plans to change its prices. Wendy's officials were not immediately available.
McDonald's stock tumbled $2.625 to $44.625 and Wendy's slid $1.50 to $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares were among the most active issues. American shares of Britain's Grand Metropolitan Plc, which owns Burger King, fell $1 to $30.625, also on the NYSE.
Dean Witter's Adelman said it remained to be seen if the McDonald's plan will bring in more customers. ""We have much more jaded consumers today,"" he said, noting price cuts were not ""new news.""
Gonzales noted some franchisees oppose price promotions since they often do not boost customer traffic enough to offset lower sandwich prices. Moreover, regular customers may be tempted to order whatever sandwich is being offered that month instead of higher-priced menu items, he said.
Daly, however, said increased sales volume is expected to offset lower menu prices. ""Margins (are) a function of volume,"" he added.
Dick Adams, chairman of the Consortium, an independent association of McDonald's franchisees, said he expected the promotion plan to be approved.
""They (franchisees) are going to vote for it,"" Adams said. ""They are being told that it's the only plan that is available.""
He said McDonald's was expected to present the plan in a satellite broadcast to operators across the country on Thursday.
McDonald's has been looking to boost domestic sales, which have been pressured because of competition. In a December 1996 memo to owners and operators, Jack Greenberg, chairman of McDonald's U.S.A. said, ""We must re-energise and focus our U.S. marketing efforts and develop a national value proposition.""

PatriciaCommins,"CPC International Inc. said Wednesday it will spin off its corn refining operations to shareholders so it can concentrate on producing consumer foods like Hellmann's mayonnaise, Mazola corn oil and Skippy peanut butter.
""The fit of those businesses (corn refining and packaged foods) is not as good as it was,"" CPC Chairman C.R. Shoemate said in a telephone interview. ""Going forward they will be able to grow ... faster by focusing on the key drivers of each of those businesses.""
The stock market applauded the move, sending CPC's shares up $2 to $84 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
""I think it's a good strategic move,"" Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach said.
CPC's corn refining operations yield high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; corn starch; dextrose, a food ingredient and sweetener, and traditional corn syrup.
Although corn refining was profitable in 1996, that business was a drag on CPC's overall earnings due to dramatic swings in the corn market, the company said.
CPC reported net income of $580 million last year, up from $539 million a year ago.
After shedding the corn business, CPC will concentrate on its global packaged food, bakery and food service businesses, which analysts called among the best in the industry.
""I think that the company will finally come into its own in terms of recognition of the quality and growth potential that it has,"" Schroder Wertheim analyst Robert Cummins said.
After the spin-off, CPC will be a global branded packaged food company with grocery products, baking and food service operations. Sales from these businesses amounted to $8.5 billion in 1996.
CPC's branded grocery and foodservice businesses operate in 62 countries worldwide. CPC has a large and profitable packaged food business in North America, although 60 percent of its total packaged food business is in Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa.
The spun-off company will be the third-largest corn refiner worldwide with sales of $1.5 billion, excluding non-consolidated joint ventures.
About two-thirds of the corn refining operations are in the United States and roughly one-third in Latin America, where it has about a 60 percent market share.
In North America, CPC's corn refining business is the leading producer of dextrose and corn starch, Shoemate said.
Corn refining joint ventures and technology agreements in Asia and Africa are small in terms of overall profits currently. ""But they are great starter positions for the longer term,"" Shoemate said.
Shoemate said the spin-off is expected to be completed in about 10 months, pending approvals, including a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it will be tax-free to CPC and its shareholders.
CPC, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said it did not expect to assign any of its existing debt to the new company.
However, it may launch an initial public offering of stock in the new company before distributing the new shares to existing shareholders, it said.
Konrad Schlatter, currently senior vice president and chief financial officer of CPC International, will be chairman and chief executive of the new corn refining company.
Samuel Scott will be president and chief operating officer of the new company and will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business.

PatriciaCommins,"McDonald's Corp.'s plan to offer deep discounts on its fast food, including 55-cent sandwiches, is a risky promotion that could hurt profits and sour relations with franchisees, analysts said Thursday.
""I think that (price promotion) strategy is flawed, to put it bluntly,"" said analyst Roger Lipton of Lipton Financial Services.
Instead of cutting prices, Lipton added, McDonald's needs to focus on ""higher-quality products and better service.""
McDonald's, which beefed up its menu offerings last year with a new ""Deluxe"" line of sandwiches, defends its products with its sales figures.
""We're a global leader. We serve 35 million customers around the world each day,"" said McDonald's spokeswoman Anna Rozenich. ""Certainly we're doing something right.""
Under the proposed promotion plan, the fast-food giant would feature one sandwich -- such as its Big Mac -- for 55 cents when a customer also buys french fries and a drink.
Short term, that will bring more customers into McDonald's, said Josh Rosen, an analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp.
But longer term, the 55-cent promotion, which is expected to apply to a different sandwich each month, could backfire. ""By selling a Big Mac at 55 cents, you are telegraphing to consumers that's what it's worth,"" said Rosen.
However, Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes applauded the 55-cent promotion, which he said will help McDonald's build incremental customer traffic. He said the promotion is akin to McDonald's ""extra value meals,"" which were launched six years ago and became McDonald's most successful item in the last 10 years.
Some franchisees are concerned, however, that the promotion, which could run about 12 months, may hurt profit margins.
""McDonald's is intent on raising top line sales and showing (positive) U.S. (same store) sales,"" said Dick Adams, head of the Consortium, a group of independent McDonald's franchisees. ""Franchisees are interested in top line sales, but only as it relates to bottom line profits.""
McDonald's, which has not commented on the details of its planned promotion, said its interests are aligned with those of its more than 2,700 franchisees in the United States.
""When our franchisees are doing well, we're doing well,"" McDonald's Rozenich said. About 80 percent of McDonald's U.S. restaurants are franchises.
Many of McDonald's U.S. franchisees have been upset by lower U.S. same-store sales trends, which some have blamed on the fast-food giant's rapid expansion, franchise sources said.
""Cannibalization (when a new unit draws sales away from an existing one) is a big issue with a lot of people,"" said one franchisee, who asked not to be named.
While competitors such as Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, said they will not follow with price cuts, McDonald's promotion likely will draw some customers away.
""They're going to take some business from people. There is a segment of the population that will gravitate to McDonald's to buy Big Macs at 55 cents,"" said Sid Feltenstein, chairman of A&amp;W Restaurants Inc., a chain of 800 units.
However, based on current menu prices at a downtown Chicago McDonald's, a customer would pay $3.01 for a 55-cent Big Mac along with a medium-sized french fries and medium-sized drink. That would be a savings of 48 cents compared with the $3.49 Big Mac extra value meal at the same McDonald's.
Asked Feltenstein: ""Are people to go out of their way to save (48 cents)?""

PatriciaCommins,"Summit Medical Systems Inc., said Monday its 1996 revenues will be ""substantially less"" than what it reported last week due to accounting discrepancies discovered by its new chief financial officer, who resigned after less than a week on the job.
The company, which makes computer-based information systems for the healthcare industry, said it expected to revise downward the $19.5 million in revenues it reported in 1996, and could also cut revenues for 1995 and 1994 as well.
Company officials were not available to comment.
Summit's shares fell by $1.44, or 30 percent, to $3.31 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market.
Volpe, Welty &amp; Co. analyst Chris Paul said Summit was believed to have about $40 million in cash and roughly 10.5 million shares.
""So it's trading below its cash value,"" he said. Still, he added, the cash the company is believed to have was ""providing a base for the shares.""
Minneapolis-based Summit said a preliminary review of its books indicated that revenues for the past three years had been overstated by between $4 million and $6 million -- or between 8 percent and 12 percent of the total.
Summit said the concerns over its revenues stem from the erroneous recognition of some revenues from the sales of software and related services.
Paul said the company did not provide any further explanation to analysts on a conference call.
""Summit Medical is extremely concerned by the discovery of accounting errors and is working vigorously to correct past mistakes and to establish stricter management controls and policies,"" Chief Executive Kevin Green said in a statement.
The company also announced that it planned to eliminate an unspecified number of jobs and establish a cost reduction program to reduce annual expenses by 20 percent.
That program is expected to result in an unspecified charge in the current quarter for employee severance and other costs, it said.
Last Wednesday, Summit reported 1996 revenues of $19.5 million, up from $17.7 million in 1995. It also posted a net loss for the year of $10.4 million, compared with a year-ago loss of $7.2 million.
The exact size of the adjustments to revenue and the years in which they apply will not be determined until an extensive audit is completed, the company said Monday.
Summit said that Donald Haas, who joined the company as chief financial officer last Monday, resigned Saturday -- after informing management that some 1996 revenue had been incorrectly recognized.
The company said that Haas told management on Thursday, the day after the company reported its 1996 results, that it had incorrectly recognized revenue during 1996 in some circumstances.
Management immediately began a review of these issues, it added.
""The company's auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, have expanded the scope of their audit and are performing additional audit procedures based in part on the questions raised by Mr. Haas,"" Summit said in its statement.
Summit added that it had retained the law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP to investigate the matter with the assistance of independent accounting advice from Arthur Andersen LLP.
The company said it expected to announce corrected financial information by the end of March.
The likely downward revision of revenues for at least a year comes at a time when Summit is in the midst of a product transition, said Paul.
The transition, Paul explained, is to a single platform for Summit's computerized information system, which collects and analyzes patient data and likely outcomes. This anlaysis enables health care providers to monitor and potentially change a patient's treatment.

PatriciaCommins,"Bagel sales continue to heat up as more restaurants open across the United States, but the number of companies that will be doing most of the baking is expected to narrow.
""It's a consolidating category,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Howard Penney.
For now, much of that consolidation in the $2.3 billion industry will involve smaller, regional chains being acquired by the larger, publicly traded firms.
Later on, access to capital is expected to be a key factor in determining which players emerge as dominant, analysts said. That competition appears to favor, in particular, the No. 2 chain, Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp..
""If you were to handicap the race to supremacy on that factor alone (access to capital), it would be hard not to arrive at the conclusion that Einstein is going to be the dominant chain,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok said.
Einstein/Noah Bagels currently has more than 315 stores in 27 states and the District of Columbia.
""We're now No. 2 in bagels but expect to be No. 1 by the end of 1997,"" said Einstein spokesman Gary Gerdemann, adding the company planned to open 300 to 350 stores this year.
Bruegger's Bagel Bakeries, a unit of Quality Dining Inc., now ranks No. 1 with 450 units in 37 states. It plans to open a ""triple-digit number"" of new stores this year, said Chris Romoser, a spokesman for Bruegger's. He did not give an exact figure.
""The category is growing by leaps and bounds,"" Romoser said. ""We believe there is a lot more room for growth.""
Jack Grumet, chairman of Manhattan Bagel Co., a chain of about 300 units, said much of that growth comes as small, independent units are gobbled up by the larger players.
""We see a lot of consolidation,"" Grumet said. ""There's a lot of fear in the minds of the smaller guys with two, four, six, eight stores"" as the large chains survey their markets.
He added that Manhattan Bagel, which plans to add 120 to 160 units this year through franchisees or area developers, gets offers from independents to purchase their stores.
The expanding industry reflects America's growing appetite for bagels, which date back to the late 17th century.
Sales in 1996 were an estimated $2.3 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 1995 and only $429 million in 1993, according to the Independent Bakers Association, citing industry figures.
""It's really a substitute for bread and for doughnuts,"" said Michael Evans, chairman of BAB Holdings Inc., which operates Big Apple Bagels.
Evans said BAB hopes open 70 to 80 units this year, expanding its network of 162 stores.
Bagel sales include products sold in grocery stores, which in the aggregate are still the leading outlet. To tap into the popularity of the bagel, breakfast cereal giant Kellogg Co. last year bought Lender's Bagels, a line of frozen grocery store bagels.
Eateries that bake fresh bagels, however, say they do not compete with the grocery stores.
""They are two separate outlets,"" Evans said, adding consumers often acquire a taste for bagels at the grocery store and then discover hot-from-the-oven products at restaurant chains.
""Lender's has done us a great favor,"" Evans said. ""It has educated the consumer...""
"
PatriciaCommins,"BAB Holdings Inc, which is still digesting its $29 million acquisition of Chesapeake Bagel Bakery, said it expects to buy more independent chains to expand its national presence as bagels grow in popularity.
""We probably get a call a week from independent bagel companies looking to be acquired,"" said Michael Evans, president of BAB, which operates Big Apple Bagels.
He added that while BAB is open to acquisitions, the focus in the near-term is integrating Chesapeake, which the company agreed to acquire earlier this year.  
Going forward, BAB will operate stores under the Big Apple Bagels and Chesapeake names, he added.
The opportunity to expand reflects the growing popularity of bagels, which have become a staple for many Americans as a substitute for bread, Evans said.
Evans reiterated that BAB, which will have 285 units after it completes its Chesapeake acquisition, hopes to have 800 units at the end of five years.
""If you take all the national chains, we have maybe 1,000 to 1,100 units. We're a long way from market saturation,"" Evans added in an interview.  
Analyst Ernest Andberg of R.J. Steichen &amp; Co said bagel restaurants are in their infancy in terms of growth potential. ""There is significant room to grow chains now,"" he said.
R.J. Steichen, which was the underwriter for BAB when it went public in November 1995, rates the stock a buy.
Also adding units are Quality Dining Inc's Bruegger's Corp, the largest U.S. bagel chain, Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp, and Manhattan Bagel Co Inc, Andberg said. He added he believes BAB is well positioned to expand particularly in smaller markets in part because its units require a relatively modest capital investment.  
Andberg added that BAB, which is headquartered in Chicago, makes its bagels from scratch on premise, which eliminates distribution concerns to serve smaller markets.
Evans said BAB, which has both franchised units and a growing number of company-owned stores, sees a ""huge potential"" in secondary markets. He added BAB would locate in a smaller city if it could draw from a surrounding population base of 25,000 to 35,000 people.
Evans said BAB also hopes to expand its Brewster's Coffee Co, which it acquired recently, including units in smaller towns.
Evans declined to give earnings and sales growth targets for BAB, which had a net loss in fiscal 1995 of $0.19 a share due to expansion costs. Earlier this month, BAB said it expects fiscal 1996 revenues, excluding the Chesapeake acquisition, to more than triple 1995 revenues of $2.0 million.

PatriciaCommins,"Tony the Tiger is going global -- and he's adding chocolate-flavored Frosted Flakes in the United States.
Kellogg Co., the leading U.S. cereal maker, said Tuesday it will launch Frosted Flakes in the world's two most populous countries -- China and India -- and also in Thailand, starting this month.
This will expand international marketing for Frosted Flakes, the top-selling U.S. cereal backed by Kellogg's Tony the Tiger emblem. Frosted Flakes are already sold in markets such as Europe, Latin America, Australia and South Africa.
Battle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg, which accounts for about one-third of the $9 billion U.S. cereal market, also said it will begin selling a chocolate-flavored version of Frosted Flakes -- Cocoa Frosted Flakes -- in the United States next month.
Cocoa Frosted Flakes are fat-free and cholestrol-free, the company said.
Frosted Flakes is the industry's top-selling cereal in the United States and ranks second worldwide behind Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Kellogg spokesman Anthony Hebron said.
The new markets for Frosted Flakes reflect Kellogg's efforts to expand its international cereal business, which has been growing at a faster rate than its U.S. operations, analysts said.
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach said he estimated Kellogg's international cereal sales grew by about 4 percent in 1996, a rate it is expected to match in 1997.
By contrast, Kellogg's domestic volume was down about 4 percent in 1996, Leach added.
In the United States, Cocoa Frosted Flakes cereal is part of Kellogg's efforts to jump-start sluggish sales and volume growth.
""One product by itself doesn't do it,"" Schroder Wertheim analyst Robert Cummins said of Kellogg's efforts in the United States. ""You have to have a steady stream of new products.""
Late last year, Kellogg launched Honey Crunch Corn Flakes, a new variety of its long-standing Corn Flakes cereal. By late 1996, Honey Crunch Corn Flakes held about a 1.2 percent market share, the company said.
Internationally, nations like China, with a population of 1.2 billion, offer long-term sales potential for Kellogg's. But Leach cautioned the Frosted Flakes launch will not have an immediate impact on Kellogg's earnings since there is not a widely established cereal market in some nations.
""Cereal is a breakfast habit that is not common to all humanity,"" Leach added.
Starting Wednesday in China, Kellogg will introduce Tony's Flakes, a reference to Frosted Flakes' Tony the Tiger.
The cereal will be launched in Thailand, which has a population of more than 60 million, under the name Kellogg Corn Frosties on March 25, when a new plant is expected to be opened there.
In India, with a population of nearly 1 billion, the product will be introduced later this year as Kellogg's Frosties.
Kellogg has been selling Corn Flakes, Rice Flakes and Wheat Flakes in China since 1995. In India, it has sold Corn Flakes, Wheat Flakes and Basmati Flakes, made from a type of rice, since 1994.
Battle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg also plans additional marketing support for Frosted Flakes in several countries outside the United States.
""Our cereal business is showing good growth in high-potential growth markets in Asia, Latin America and southern Europe,"" Hebron of Kellogg said. ""And, in more established markets like Australia, Canada and Mexico.
Kellogg stock dropped 75 cents to $68.25 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

PatriciaCommins,"General Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios and Wheaties breakfast cereals, Wednesday reported higher earnings for its fiscal third quarter, despite a drop in total sales and domestic cereal volume.
Looking ahead, Minneapolis-based General Mills said some of its product lines, including cereal, have continued to see softer sales. Analysts said that may mean the company may post a smaller increase in earnings for fiscal 1997, which ends in May, than originally expected.
""We had weak volume in January and February. Some of that softness has extended into the first half of March,"" Eric Larson, senior vice president, investor relations, said. ""We need to get that turned around.""
General Mills, which also makes Betty Crocker cake mixes and Hamburger Helper, earned $122.8 million, or 78 cents a share, in the third quarter ended Feb. 23. That was up from year-earlier earnings of $116.3 million, or 73 cents a share. Sales dropped to $1.29 billion from $1.31 billion.
Third quarter earnings were in line with analysts' estimates.
General Mills said its domestic retail packaged food volume declined 1 percent in the third quarter, and cereal unit volume was down 3 percent in the quarter.
For the first nine months of the year, however, General Mill's cereal sales volume was up 4 percent, outpacing the industry's 1 percent growth.
Excluding its recent acquisition of branded cereals from Ralcorp Holdings Inc., including the Chex line, General Mills' cereal market share for the first nine months was up nearly a percentage point to 24 percent.
General Mills is the second-largest U.S. cereal market behind Kellogg Co., which accounts for about one-third of the domestic cereal market.
Schroder Wertheim managing director Robert Cummins said that, despite General Mill's year-to-date gains, the total U.S. cereal market has declined for several months, including in early March.
""They talk about this being a transition period for consumers,"" Cummins said. ""(Cereal) prices on the shelf are lower, but there are fewer promotions.""
After a ""very quiet third quarter"" in terms of marketing, Larson said, General Mills will roll out new promotions in the fourth quarter that will tie-in with the movie, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park.""
Analysts said the company indicated its earnings for fiscal 1997 would beat the $476.4 million, or $3 a share, it earned in fiscal 1996. But earnings likely will not be as high as the $3.10 a share that many analysts had been predicting.
To meet the $3.10 estimate, Larson said General Mills would have to see total domestic sales volume growth above the 4 percent increase it posted in the first nine months of the year.
""We need to see volume slightly above our nine-month trend line rate to achieve the estimate,"" he added.
Analysts added that the company indicated it was more comfortable with earnings estimates around $3.05 a share.
""(Fiscal 1997 earnings of) $3.10 would be a best-case scenario,"" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said. ""For that to happen, things would have to turn around, and you can't always predict a turnaround."" O'Neil cut his fiscal 1997 earnings estimate to $3.07 a share from $3.10.
General Mills stock was down $1.75 at $63 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

PatriciaCommins,"Vita Food Products Inc, which sells kosher seafood and other specialty products, is scouting for acqusitions that could help it boost annual sales four-fold within the next five years.
""With the right mix of acquisitions, I think we could do $75 million to $100 million (in sales) annually. We've (also) got some things that could really take off internally,"" Stephen Rubin, president, said in an interview. ""I'd like to see it (the sales target reached) before five years.""
Vita's sales amounted to $21.4 million in 1995.  
The company, with products such as salmon and herring sold under the Vita brand, expects to complete at least one acquisition by the end of the year, Rubin said.
Acquisition targets include companies that sell kosher food or products that could later be certified as kosher. One of the targets is related to seafood, he added.
Rubin added that Vita could also acquire a regional, non-kosher food company and take it national under the existing brand name through Vita's distribution network.
Over 95 percent of Vita's sales, however, are kosher products.  
Jay Dembsky, Vita's chief financial officer, estimated that the kosher food market overall is growing by 10 to 11 percent annually, whereas the overall food industry grows only in line with the population.
Kosher food, he added, appeals to consumers beyond those adhering to Jewish dietary laws. Kosher food carries ""a perception of higher quality,"" Dembsky said.
Vita also hopes to reap higher sales in 1997 from two new products that were rolled out in the fourth quarter of 1996 -- a line of hummus, a Middle Eastern dish made from chick peas, and frozen salmon burgers.
""We expect to see meaningful impact in 1997 from these products,"" Dembsky said.
Vita, which went public earlier this year at $6.00 a share, said it would make secondary offerings in the future if it needed to raise capital for acquisition programs, Rubin said.
Vita shres were up 1/8 at 5-1/8.

PatriciaCommins,"Dean Foods Inc, which staged a turnaround in the fiscal third quarter with earnings more than double a year ago, expects to make an acquisition in the fourth quarter, potentially in the fluid milk business.
""We are probably talking to more companies today than ever (before),"" William McManaman, chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.
Potential acquisition targets include fluid milk processors and or a small company that would complement Dean Foods' specialty segment, which makes coffee creamer, he said.  
McManaman said he expected Dean Foods to close at least one acquisition ""in the not too distant future,"" and likely in the current fiscal fourth quarter.
Acquisitions in the past have been a growth engine for Franklin Park, Ill.-based Dean Foods. Earlier, it posted better than expected third quarter earnings of $0.51 a share, up from $0.17 a year ago. Earnings reflected improvements in all of its segments, including dairy, vegetables, pickles and specialty foods.
Prudential Securities analyst John McMillin called the third quarter results a ""positive surprise.""  
""It's a company that's getting its act together,"" McMillin said.
Last year, Dean Foods undertook a strategic review of all its operations, which included closing or disposing of several plants, streamlining vegetable operations, and cutting costs.
""We've pulled back in a number of areas and ridded ourselves of a lot of poor performing pieces,"" McManaman said. ""Now we have to grow our cores a lot faster than in the past.""
For example, Dean Foods' pickle operations earned $7.8 million in the quarter, up from $4.9 million a year ago, although sales declined to $82.6 million from $88.0 million.  
""We eliminated a couple of...products where we were not making a lot of money and customers where we were not making a lot of money,"" McManaman said, actions that cut pickle sales but boosted earnings.
Vegetable sales in the quarter dropped to $143.4 million from $146.5 million, reflecting lower inventories and higher prices that trimmed some sales. But the division posted a profit of $8.5 million, benefiting from lower costs, compared with a year-ago loss of $547,000.
On the dairy side, earnings were $27.0 million, up from $13.5 million last year, while sales gained to $443.1 million from $409.2 million.
""Our volume in the fluid milk business was up over four percent in the quarter, and we didn't make any acquisitions,"" McManaman said. ""That's increased volume or market share in the markets in which we compete.""
Dean Foods shares were up 5/8 at 33-7/8 after trading as high as 34-3/8 earlier in the day.

PatriciaCommins,"Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc is launching 28 new corn hybrids this year, which it hopes will help reverse over the next few years a recent drop in its leading seed corn market share.
""We feel very good about the 28 new hybrids that we're introducing in 1997,"" Richard ""Rick"" McConnell, senior vice president and director of research, said in a telephone interview. ""We think we're going to be able to position those well in 1997 for customers to get a good look at, and will be able to build volume up very quickly for '98 and '99...""  
Of the 28 new corn hybrids that Pioneer is introducing, eight have the Bt gene to fight off the European corn borer, a serious insect pest, McConnell said.
These Bt corn varieties are part of a host of genetically altered, or transgenic, corn hybrids that are being developed and launched by Pioneer and other agricultural companies.
Although Pioneer's share of the North American seed corn market is four times that of its nearest competitor, the need to develop unique biotech crops has leveled the playing field, analysts noted.  
""It (biotechnology) has made the other players seem a lot bigger. They (Pioneer) did not move as quickly and as early on biotechnology,"" Piper Jaffray analyst George Dahlman said. ""They have done an amazing job of catching up.""
In addition to Bt corn, Pioneer's other transgenic products include soybeans that can withstand the use of Monsanto Co's Roundup herbicide. Pioneer also will have limited quantities of corn that can resist Liberty herbicide, which is produced by AgrEvo, a venture between Hoechst AG and Schering AG.  
Pioneer is developing corn that can resist Roundup, but it may be 1998 or 1999 until it is introduced, McConnell said.
For this year, McConnell declined to project Pioneer's North American corn market share, which in fiscal 1996 dropped to 44 percent from 45 percent. DeKalb Genetics Corp, the number two player, has an 11 percent market share in corn.
He linked the market share loss in 1996 in part to the fallout from disease and insect problems that hurt two Pioneer hybrids in 1995. Those problems are being addressed with new corn hybrids.  
Piper Jaffray's Dahlman said he expects Pioneer's market share will be about flat in fiscal 1997 ending in August compared with 1996.
To bolster its future product lineup, Pioneer would consider collaborating with other players, including some outside the agricultural industry, McConnell said. ""There will be other biotech boutiques that we will want to work with,"" he added.
Pioneer currently collaborates with Mycogen Inc, an agricultural biotech company, and Human Genome Sciences Inc, which is involved in a DNA project with Pioneer.
While Pioneer targets 20 percent return on equity and double-digit percentage growth in earnings per share, it will not shy away from investing in technology, McConnell said.
""We're not looking to shoot ourselves in the foot with short-term issues just to achieve those goals,"" McConnell said. ""We'll make the appropriate investments.""

PeterHumphrey,"A leader of the crushed 1989 democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square predicted on Thursday there would be no similar crackdowns in China or Hong Kong under Chinese rule, but there would be pressure to conform.
Han Dongfang, a former railwayman who formed a free trade union in the 1989 student-led democracy movement, said China's leaders had learned lessons from ""this historical misunderstanding"" and would not use the army this way again.
In June eight years ago China's communist rulers sent the People's Liberation Army into Beijing and ruthlessly put down the movement with heavy loss of life.
In Tiananmen Square, the hub of the protests, it was as though hungry children were tempted by a green unripe apple of democracy, the 34-year-old dissident, now living in exile in British-ruled Hong Kong, said in an interview.
""They reached up and ate it, and suddenly they realised it tasted very bad,"" Han said.
""You cannot blame those hungry children, and you cannot blame the apple for being so green. So June 4, 1989, was a big historical misunderstanding,"" he said.
""I don't think anybody can use tanks and machineguns again to crack down on a social movement.""
China's next social upheaval, if it happened, was likely to involve workers and farmers complaining they had no food or money.
""Do you think machineguns and tanks can crack down on such hungry, angry people if they are going to die of hunger anyway?""
Many of Hong Kong's 6.4 million people have been worried that China will break its hands-off promise and introduce repressive rule in the territory.
Beijing has already unveiled plans to repeal some Hong Kong legislation protecting civil rights when Britain hands the colony back on July 1 -- ordinances it has said violated the territory's future China-designed constitution.
China also plans to dissolve the elected legislature, saying the council was elected under reforms enacted over its objections.
Han said that after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month, President Jiang Zemin's ruling group was too busy with internal problems to crack down on Hong Kong.
""They face very, very big problems in the villages, unemployment in big state enterprises, which are to be reformed, and in the ethnic minority areas,"" Han said.
Han said Hong Kong was a goldmine for China.
""Chinese leaders will only break the golden egg if Hong Kong becomes a very big danger to their power. I don't think that will happen,"" Han said, speaking a day after Hong Kong announced record fiscal reserves of HK$330 billion (US$42.3 billion).
Beijing has promised the territory will retain a high degree of autonomy and its capitalist system for 50 years.
Han spent two years in jail for ""counter-revolutionary acts"" after Tiananmen, and was then released and allowed to go to the United States for medical treatment.
When he tried to return to China in 1993, his passport was cancelled, forcing him into exile in Hong Kong.
Asked if he thought China would crush the Hong Kong democracy movement after the sovereignty change, Han said Beijing would be more subtle than in 1989.
He said China would try to influence Hong Kong through prods and whispers to its new legislators and leaders -- all of whom have been screened by Beijing before the handover -- and that the business community would support curbs on democracy.
""The Chinese leaders have gained a lot of experience since 1989 inside China. They welcome businessmen and tell them they will have better conditions for their business than before, in a society with no social movements, no trouble for business.""
Han said he trusted Hong Kong's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, who was selected by a Beijing-backed committee.
""He is not a bad person. I don't think he'll send protesters to jail. He's not going to wear the same trousers as the Chinese government.""

PeterHumphrey,"Hong Kong's Democratic Party leaders, often seen as the arch-foes of Beijing, launched a marathon mission to North America and Europe on Wednesday to brief the West on the territory's plight as China takes over.
Britain hands the colony for over 150 years back to Beijing at midnight on June 30, and the Democratic Party has been in the forefront of political clashes with China over Chinese plans to curb democracy and civil rights laws in Hong Kong.
Party leader Martin Lee and his deputy Szeto Wah, a leading anti-communist activist, would lead the mission to the United States, Canada and the United Nations offices in Switzerland. Fellow legislator Andrew Cheng would also be going.
The three will speak to audiences in Seattle, Vancouver, Calgary, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Toronto, Washington, New York, Ottawa and Geneva.
The tour is the biggest ever undertaken by the Hong Kong democratic movement's beacon organisation to convince Western opinion of the need to help safeguard the territory's basic freedoms after communist-ruled China takes over.
Lee is sharply at odds both with China and with its pick for Hong Kong's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa. Tung has accused Lee of being ""anti-China"" and of ""badmouthing Hong Kong"" by spreading doom scenarios about the territory's furture.
""Our goal is to emphasise the vital importance of Hong Kong as the economic and trade centre of the Pacific Rim,"" Lee said as he left Hong Kong for Seattle late on Tuesday.
""We will detail latest developments in Hong Kong and their implications for the future. I intend to give a clear, realistic picture of the situation here and encourage the American and Canadian people to take a close interest now and in the future.""
In a move certain to anger China, Lee will testify to the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva on April 7, where he said he plans to discuss ""the threats to freedom, civil rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong"".
China plans to roll back liberal laws on the freedom of association, which includes rules on forming political parties, and on freedom of assembly, which covers rules on political demonstrations, as well as Hong Kong's Bill of Rights.
Beijing says the moves are needed because the liberalisation of the political scene in recent years breaches understandings reached with Britain and formal agreements on the handover.
Lee said he would also raise China's plan to dissolve Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council upon the handover and replace it with an appointed body composed of pro-China politicians.
He would argue that Hong Kong's continued economic success and freedoms were inseparable from its political freedoms.
With 19 seats, Lee's is the largest party in the 60-member legislature. It was in the vanguard of a victory for democratic groups who took 70 percent of the vote in free democratic polls in 1995. Pro-China parties were rejected at the polls.
Lee said he would also lobby Washington to renew China's most favoured nation trading status when it comes up for review this year. Hong Kong benefits substantially from China's trading privileges because the bulk of the trade goes via Hong Kong.
In Washington on April 1-2, Lee will address the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and governmental and congressional leaders and he would lobby for visa-free access to the United States by Hong Kong people after the Chinese takeover. The mission was also intended to raise funds for the Hong Kong Democratic Party -- in what may be the last year when this is legally possible if China goes ahead as it intends and bans links between Hong Kong parties and overseas organisations.
The party would address overseas Chinese communities, think tanks, business leaders and legal and human rights groups.
After visiting Geneva Lee will return in Washington on April 9 to receive one of the country's most prestigious political awards, the National Endowment for Democracy's 1997 Democracy Award.
Previous recipients include Czechoslovak dissident-turned- President Vaclav Havel and rights campaigner Yelena Bonner, the wife of late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov.

PeterHumphrey,"When Britain hands its Asian pearl Hong Kong back to China in less than 100 days, it will end a century and a half of colonial rule and a century and a half of Chinese national shame.
It will also spark the party of the century, a two-day holiday binge marked by fireworks and gun salutes, popping champagne corks and clinking glasses.
At midnight on June 30 in Hong Kong -- afternoon teatime half a world away in London where Big Ben will be striking five -- the sun will set on Britain's once-global empire.
Hong Kong's 6.4 million people will cheer, weep or sigh as the Union Jack comes down and Communist China's red flag goes up.
Prince Charles and Chinese President Jiang Zemin will be in Hong Kong. So, too, will be former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who negotiated the handover, and Lee Kuan Yew, who steered Singapore to prosperity after the city state's independence from Britain three decades ago.
Britain and China are still arguing about the guest list.
But the man who set the stage, who opened up the world's most populous nation and began to reshape it in the image of Hong Kong's freewheeling, money-spinning economy, will be absent. China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died last month.
HANDOVER PARTYGOERS WILL HAVE STUNNING HARBOUR VIEW
Builders are hurrying to finish the venue where the joint handover ceremony, centrepiece of the party, will unfold.
At China's insistence it will be indoors in a huge HK$4.8 billion (US$615 million) extension of Hong Kong's Convention Centre. Would-be protesters will be unable to disrupt it.
The steel and glass building rises from a man-made island off the Wanchai waterfront with stunning views of Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong Island, and the New Territories mountains.
The 4,000 guests at the ceremony will be seated in the column-free Grand Hall attached to the foyer with a view of the necklace of glittering skyscrapers that frame the harbour.
""It's fantastic for us that our opening is going to be a historic event,"" said Niels Kransoe, chief executive of the construction project. ""I am thrilled to bits.""
PRINCE CHARLES TO GIVE HONG KONG AWAY
There will be three phases -- eve-of-handover pageantry staged by the departing British, a joint handover ceremony, and post-handover revelry organised by the post-colonial regime.
Hong Kong's Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa, appointed by China, led 20,000 people this month on a charity walk to raise HK$17 million for the post-handover parties.
Prince Charles will represent Queen Elizabeth, along with Britain's Foreign Secretary. ""The Queen never gives territories away,"" a colonial official commented.
Just before six in the evening, Governor Chris Patten will bid farewell to Government House, on Hong Kong Island's Upper Albert Road, the seat of colonial power.
Around 6 p.m., Patten and Charles will inspect the troops and preside over a farewell to the British administration at military headquarters on the Hong Kong waterfront. At midnight China's People's Liberation Army troops assume military duties.
The Queen's royal yacht Britannia will be moored in Victoria Harbour as the backdrop for the sunset parade. The frigate Chatham will also be on the water nearby, part of a Royal Navy task force cruising Asian waters this year to wave the flag.
4,000 VIP GUESTS AT BANQUET FIT FOR A KING
At 9 p.m. 4,000 VIPs from Britain, China, Hong Kong and much of the rest of the world, armed with cutlery or chopsticks, will tuck into the biggest banquet in the history of Hong Kong.
Up to 600 waiters will ferry 20,000 to 40,000 pieces of chinaware and glassware around, caterers say.
The midnight handover ceremony in the Grand Foyer hall will be a spectacle of flag changing, national anthems and speeches.
""Maybe some politicians in Britain hope the handover ceremony can symbolise the glorious or honorable withdrawl of Britain from Hong Kong. We have no objection to that because that means we can take over in a dignified and honorable manner,"" Chinese Premier Li Peng said of the handover fiesta.
Jiang is expected to receive Hong Kong back into the Chinese fold as the midnight ceremony is beamed on to a giant screen at the military parade ground and to homes across the world after a variety show and a ballet about China's last emperor.
BRITISH LEADERS WILL SAIL INTO THE SUNSET
Prince Charles and Patten will sail from Hong Kong on what is likely to be Britannia's final cruise before decommissioning. Their first port of call is likely to be the Philippines, one day's sail away, or the former British colony of Singapore.
Hong Kong taxpayers will foot the HK$233 million bill for the extravaganza. The grand banquet and reception will cost a tidy $HK6.5 million, Hong Kong's most expensive dinner party.
Another HK$85 million is being spent on building a huge press and broadcasting centre for 6,000 journalists.
""It is Hong Kong's responsibility to pay... because it is our historic moment and we should show the world that we will have a bright future,"" said Home Affairs Secretary Michael Suen.
""We estimate the event will bring in four hundred to eight hundred million dollars (US$102.5-205 million) to Hong Kong's economy,"" said Suen.

PeterHumphrey,"An overture by China to bring its critics into the team picking Hong Kong's future leadership shows openness but might split the democratic camp in the British colony, analysts said on Tuesday.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this month the 400-member body that will choose the chief executive and legislators who will run the territory after its July 1, 1997, transfer to China could include people with divergent views on democracy.
His remark at a Beijing meeting was taken in the colony as an olive branch towards Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party, which so far has been excluded from transition arrangements.
Although pegged to the acceptance of China's plan for an appointed ""provisional legislature"" to replace the current fully elected council, the remark was in stark contrast to China's harsh invective against the party over the past year.
The gesture is also fuelling heated discussion in local political circles and newspaper columns about China's motives.
""It might be an attempt to split the democrats, but more probably Beijing has realised that they've failed to split them so far and it's time to get them on board,"" Hong Kong University political analyst Nihal Jayawickrama told Reuters.
""I'm sure there are elements in the Democratic Party who will feel the urge to respond positively,"" he said.
But Democratic Party leader Martin Lee last weekend rejected the idea of joining the Selection Committee, saying that would amount to recognition of an illegitimate body.
The party argues that China's plan to scrap the present legislature and appoint a new ""provisional"" one has no basis in law or in the handover treaties with London.
""So long as China insists that any participant must assist in both selection processes -- Hong Kong's future chief executive and the provisional legislature -- I can't see how they can get the democrats on board,"" Jayawickrama said.
But he said it was likely the temptation would prove strong for some of Lee's associates and that they would quit the party.
China is very eager to give the Selection Committee a greater air of legitimacy by including some democrats, some China analysts in Hong Kong believe.
""At the end of the day, it's a question of who gets into the committee. And I don't think people like Lee or (deputy party leader) Szeto Wah would get in even if they are nominated,"" political commentator Andy Ho told Reuters.
The leaders of the party, the biggest in this territory of 6.2 million people, have drawn Beijing's wrath since 1989 when they sided with the student-led, pro-democracy movement that Chinese army tanks crushed in Tiananmen Square.
""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that China has changed its position towards the Democratic Party,"" Ho said. ""It just wants to create an impression of openness.""
Some of China's Hong Kong advisers differ in their view of Qian's remarks. Tsang Yok-Sing, a pro-Beijing politician, has said he did not see them as an invitation to the democrats.
Emily Lau, an outspoken independent democrat who has often riled China's communist rulers, interpreted Qian's comment as a brazen effort to drive a wedge into the democratic movement.
Qian had divided the pro-democracy camp into ""people who are prepared to compromise their principles and those who will stand firm"", Lau wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.
""With the scramble for seats on the Selection Committee having begun in earnest, it will rapidly become clear that some members of the pro-democracy camp are eager for a place... These people have long been itching to open dialogue with Beijing and are now only too eager to be given recognition,"" Lau wrote.
"
PeterHumphrey,"Chinese officials sent out positive signals about Beijing's future handling of Hong Kong on Friday, and diplomats indicated China and Britain had agreed on a VIP guestlist for a grand handover party.
Hong Kong reverts to communist-ruled China at midnight on June 30 after a century and a half as a British colony, and is to retain its separate capitalist system for 50 years.
Chinese officials attending a seminar on the transition sought to assure Hong Kong there will be no influx of mainland Chinese and that the future garrison will not misbehave.
They also tried to ease fears that the economy in the capitalist enclave of 6.4 million people will suffer and stressed the need to allow Hong Kong businessmen to travel.
Wang Fengchao, deputy head of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, dismissed fears that China would open the flood gates to migrants cashing in on Hong Kong's economic miracle.
He said there were strict rules on entry into Hong Kong, and children of illegal immigrants would not be allowed in. ""These provisions...will have a deterrent effect,"" he said.
The general who guards the political purity of China's future Hong Kong garrison said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would not meddle in local government or business affairs.
""The Hong Kong garrison and government will be independent military and administrative systems with no affiliate relationship and will not interfere with each other,"" said the garrison's political commissar, Major-General Xiong Zi Ren.
""I can categorically tell you that we resolutely will abide by all regulations set out in the law,"" Xiong said.
""We have already set a rule that bans involvement in production business,"" he said.
Tackling another issue worrying Hong Kong emigrants around the world, Wang announced a grace period for them to return to the territory if they want to keep permanent residency rights.
An estimated 750,000 of Hong Kong's 6.4 million people have foreign citizenship. The bulk have made Canada, Australia, Britain or the United States their adopted homes.
If they are abroad for long after July 1 they might lose their Hong Kong permanent residency.
Wang said China was prepared to allow them a grace period, but the length of time would be set by the post-handover Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
""As to the length of time they are allowed to stay outside Hong Kong, this is for the SAR to decide,"" he said.
Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the future cabinet of Hong Kong Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa, said he believed the period would be up to three years.
Britain, meanwhile, signaled it had agreed with China on the broad outlines of a guest list for the joint celebration of the handover to China three months from now.
A British official told Reuters the two sides would invite a total of about 3,200 guests to the event.
About 400 ""international guests"" would be included. Some would be government ministers and the heads of international organisations, said the official, who asked not to be named.
But China and Britain did not expect heads of government or heads of state. One diplomat said this was a sign China had won in its efforts not to give Britain too glorious a send-off.
Hong Kong's colonial Chief Secretary Anson Chan, who is keeping her job under Tung, said in Canada on Thursday China was fully committed to granting Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.
""It is clear the Chinese leaders are fully committed to the faithful implementation of the late Deng Xiaoping's visionary concept of 'one country, two systems' and Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong,"" Chan said.
""There is a clear appreciation that only in this way can Hong Kong best serve the interests of China,"" she said.
However, the United States said on the same day that China had sent mixed and sometimes disturbing signals on the future of Hong Kong's legislature, human rights and press freedom after Beijing takes control on July 1.
""Over the past year, developments in Hong Kong have sent mixed signals about some aspects of the change in sovereignty,"" the State Department said in a report to Congress.
""There have been significant positive developments since March 1996,"" it said. But ""China's actions regarding the future of the legislature and the laws governing human rights and civil liberties in Hong Kong have been disturbing and have caused concern in both Hong Kong and the international community.""
China has set in motion plans to replace Hong Kong's elected legislature with an appointed body and to water down liberal laws protecting civil liberties and democracy.
"
PeterHumphrey,"The United States signed an important air services agreement with Hong Kong on Monday, guaranteeing its future aviation links after the British-ruled territory's return to China later this year.
But Washington voiced concern about a big rise in landing fees which has dismayed airlines planning to use Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok, due to open a year from now.
The territory's airport authority chief said the door was still open for discussions with the airline industry.
Signing Hong Kong's 19th air accord with foreign countries, U.S. Consul-General Richard Boucher said Washington was concerned levies for landing and parking at Chek Lap Kok would be too high, and he called for competitive rates.
""This is something that our firms are primarily concerned about, that they raised with us, and yet it is something that we in the government are concerned about, and we want to talk to the relevant authorities on the Hong Kong side,"" Boucher said.
""We have (talked) in the past and we will continue to talk to them, as our companies have, to try to work out this problem, so that Hong Kong has efficient, competitive and commercially reasonable rates and a setup here that works both in a commercial sense and in terms of a competitive sense as well.""
Airlines have said recently landing costs could be three to four times higher than at the present Kai Tak airport, and even the airport authority has said overall fees may nearly double.
Industry Analysts and some airlines, such as Taiwan's China Airlines, have said the rises could hurt their profit margins, push up ticket prices, or force traffic to other airports at nearby Macau or China's Zhuhai and Shenzhen.
Hong Kong Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip said airport officials were still consulting the airlines.
""The Airport Authority will certainly listen to the viewpoints expressed by the airlines, and I don't think a final decision has been taken. And that's the whole purpose of having consultations with the airlines,"" Ip told reporters.
Monday's agreement opened the way for new routings and services, giving the United States the right to select carriers to provide non-stop services from three additional gateways.
So far, Chicago and Detroit have been picked in addition to existing gateways of New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco.
The agreement provided for the preservation of open competitive entry and unrestricted service offerings from all U.S. points, and preservation of the U.S. ""round the world service"" run by United Airlines.
It provided ""fifth freedom rights"" between Hong Kong and points in the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand. The United States has chosen flights between Hong Kong and Subic Bay and between Hong Kong and Manila under this provision.
Under the accord, Hong Kong received new gateways in the United States for passenger and all-cargo services, choosing New York and Chicago for this provision. New fifth-freedom rights were also awarded to Hong Kong, but have not yet been taken up.
Nine U.S. airlines operate about 84 passenger and cargo services per week to Hong Kong. In 1996, they carried 920,000 passengers and 147,000 tonnes of cargo on direct services between Hong Kong and the United States.
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Air Hong Kong operate about 21 services per week between Hong Kong and the United States. In 1996, they carried 315,000 passengers and about 42,000 tonnes of air cargo.

PeterHumphrey,"A Hong Kong human rights group reacted with scepticism on Tuesday to China's declaration that it would subscribe to a United Nations' human rights convention.
China, embroiled in controversy over its human rights record, said on Monday it will sign the U.N. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights before the end of 1997.
Paul Harris, who heads the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor and closely watches rights developments related to Hong Kong, said the move seemed to be a bid to dodge international censure in a debate at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva this week.
""I'm unimpressed,"" Harris told Reuters.
""The timing is obviously designed to reduce the risk of China being condemned in the debate at the United Nations.
""I'm very sceptical whether it will be carried out,"" Harris said of Beijing's avowed intention to sign the convention.
He said Monday's pledge by President Jiang Zemin to visiting French Defence Minister Charles Millon did not make clear if Beijing would go all the way and ratify the covenant in full.
Once the Geneva debate had blown over, China would probably just ""forget about it"", Harris said.
He questioned why China, in its latest move, had referred only to the so-called ""ECOSOC"" human rights covenant, and not to the other more important U.N. convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
China has in the past resisted making any commitment to observe international human rights standards and rarely submits reports on the human rights situation on its own turf, where hundreds of dissidents languish in jail.
China also resists the notion of submitting human rights reports on Hong Kong, a British colony that reverts to Beijing's control on July 1, under an international treaty that requires ICCPR human rights standards to be applied in the territory.
Both U.N. covenants would require China to submit regular reports on compliance with standards laid down in the documents, but membership could also give China a voice on the international committee monitoring the accords.
Harris said there had been no signs of any liberalisation in China's attitude toward dissent in recent months.

PeterHumphrey,"Planned curbs on Hong Kong civil liberties, justified by the future government on grounds of national security, would cut chances of the territory being used to subvert communist China, analysts said on Thursday.
But the proposals, launched on Wednesday and offered to the public for three weeks of feedback, drew a torrent of criticism for being retrograde and open to abuse.
Citing the risk to ""national security"" posed by foreign forces, the future leader Tung Chee-hwa proposed to tighten the screws through two key laws -- the Public Order Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance -- after China takes over the British colony on July 1.
The changes would bar overseas funding of local political groups and grant police sweeping powers to ban demonstrations.
Currently, people ""notify"" police about planned protests. In future they would need permission, and police could refuse it.
Sunny Loh, a political analyst at Hong Kong University, told Reuters the biggest impact would be the ban on foreign funding for Hong Kong political organisations, many of which, such as the popular Democratic Party, raise money abroad.
""It's a retrograde step... Local groups will have to deal with their relations with foreign countries very carefully,"" he said. ""There will be more sensitivity to demonstrations, protests and petitions because they will be seen to affect national security.""
This would cut the risk of foreign groups using Hong Kong as a base to subvert China, Loh said. Behind China's concern is a long history of groups doing just that.
Law professor Nihal Jayawickrama said China wanted to keep a close eye on pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong, and the changes would lead to inspections of their accounts for foreign links.
""How do you make sure they are not being influenced in their thinking by foreign forces? ...They'll have to scrutinise the parties' accounts for foreign funding,"" he said.
In the late 19th century Hong Kong became a base of the nationalist revolutionaries who plotted and overthrew the last imperial dynasty in 1911, creating China's first republic.
Even the Communists, before they came to power in 1949, sometimes used Hong Kong as an offshore venue for meetings beyond the reach of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist regime on the mainland.
China also has vivid memories of the 1989 democracy movement which its tanks bloodily crushed in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
The movement received material support from Hong Kong political and business groups, as well as information support through a ""fax war"" from groups based abroad. Some of the activists who fled that crackdown live in exile in Hong Kong.
China also fears that Taiwan, its arch-foe and the base of the remnant Nationalist regime which fled the mainland in 1949, will finance and organise anti-Beijing movements in Hong Kong.
After the three week pulse-taking on the plans, a China-backed interim legislature, which will replace the elected Legislative Council, will draft the relevant legislation.
The changes will take effect on July 1 when China resumes sovereignty after 156 years of colonial rule and makes Hong Kong into a quasi autonomous ""Special Administrative Region"".
Tung's plans were lashed by the democracy movement, pressure groups, departing colonial Governor Chris Patten, and a raft of editorials in the Hong Kong press.
""It is not as if we are on the verge of civil chaos -- in theory, at least, trouble could be made more likely by restrictive measures,"" said the South China Morning Post.
""The net has been spread so wide that human rights groups, unions, and environment protection groups may also be suppressed if they have political views,"" said legislator Albert Ho.
Analysts said the plan raised queries as to whether foreign groups such as Amnesty International, which has its main Asian office in Hong Kong, could continue operating there.
Trade unions and church groups, which receive foreign financial support, could also easily be viewed as political.
""How are we supposed to survive if we are banned from taking subsidies from international labour groups?"" said Leung Yiu-chung, who runs a neighbourhood labour group.
"
PeterHumphrey,"China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), poorly regarded by many in Hong Kong, will send an advance party into the territory next Monday, more than two months before Beijing formally resumes sovereignty.
Hong Kong unexpectedly announced an accord on the troop movement on Tuesday, ending months of deadlock over the size and role of a PLA advance guard, and whether they would bear arms.
""The two sides of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group have reached agreement on the arrival of 40 advance personnel of the future Garrison in Hong Kong from April 21,"" said a Hong Kong government spokesman.
""They will not be armed and will not enjoy any special legal status or...privileges and immunities,"" the spokesman said.
""This agreement provides a firm basis for the smooth transfer of defence responsibilities.""
But the PLA advance guard will have no defence or security role and their work will not affect the British troops who will garrison Hong Kong up to the handover at midnight on June 30.
It was the first positive news after weeks of wrangling between Britain and China over a controversial shadow legislature, Beijing's plans to curb civil liberties, and China's move to set its own rules on Hong Kong residency rights.
The PLA advance guard will prepare the facilities for the PLA garrison due to take over defence duties from the British army's ""Black Watch"" regiment on July 1. The PLA garrison might eventually be up to 10,000-strong, military sources say.
""The duties of advance personnel are to make practical preparations for the PLA to take over the responsibility for the defence of Hong Kong, including familiarisation with military sites, liaison with British forces and the Hong Kong government, and coordination of communications support,"" the spokesman said.
The group will be led by a deputy commander of the future Garrison, an officer of the rank of Major General.
A 28-member liaison group led by the deputy commander will be located with British forces at the Prince of Wales Barracks in Central Hong Kong. The other 12 will be billeted with the British garrison on Stonecutters Island in Hong Kong harbour.
The PLA troops would wear uniforms within the barracks but civilian clothing outside military sites.
""They have to strictly abide by all Hong Kong laws,"" the spokesman said in an effort to allay fears among Hong Kong's 6.4 million population that the PLA would put itself above the law.
The PLA has a bad name in Hong Kong, where many people vividly remember how the Chinese army sent tanks into Beijing's Tiananmen Square and bloodily crushed a student-led democracy movement with a heavy loss of life.
China has reinforced those fears and memories with a series of moves designed to trim democracy and civil liberties in Hong Kong after the sovereignty change this year.
It has overridden British objections and appointed a new interim legislature to replace the elected Legislative Council on July 1, when 156 years of British rule come to an end and Hong Kong becomes a semi-autonomous capitalist region of China.
It has also launched moves to roll back laws on the freedom to demonstrate and form political parties, as well as democratic elections introduced by London in recent years.
The latest breakthrough came just as the mood was growing bleak in Sino-British handover negotiations.
A move by Beijing on Monday to set the rules on who is entitled to permanent residency in Hong Kong after it reverts to China had stirred up a bitter quarrel.
""It's our domestic affair. We don't need the British to tell us who is a Chinese national,"" China's Hong Kong policy boss Lu Ping said. Britain promptly accused China of going it alone on an issue that should have been settled diplomatically.
"
PeterHumphrey,"Hong Kong's ride to Chinese rule hit a new bump on Wednesday when future leader Tung Chee-hwa put on hold a trip to the United States during which he had planned to calm fears over the British colony's handover.
Tung's move came as the man who will effectively face him as opposition leader, Martin Lee, became the focus of media attention in the United States on a tour in which he has issued gloomy warnings of a Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong.
Tung, who will be Hong Kong's chief executive, said he was too busy at home, where there are 76 days left before Britain leaves and China's red flag is hoisted at midnight on June 30.
""The chief executive believes his focus must be in Hong Kong,"" Tung said in a statement.
Selected by a China-controlled committee in December to run Hong Kong after Beijing resumes sovereignty, Tung had planned a pre-handover visit to the United States to soothe anxiety there about planned curbs on Hong Kong's political liberties.
The cancellation comes despite calls by U.S. executives in the territory, worried that excessive gloom about Hong Kong could harm business ties, for Tung to go to Washington.
A spokesman for his office said Tung set great store on Hong Kong's ties with Washington and would try to make the visit by the end of this year.
He denied the postponement was linked to the visit by Lee, leader of the popular Hong Kong Democratic Party, who is meeting President Bill Clinton at the end of the week.
""He's just too busy,"" the spokesman said.
Lee has dominated headlines about Hong Kong lately as he toured Europe and North America, warning of China's plans to curb protests and foreign funding of political groups, and to replace the elected legislature with a handpicked body.
In New York, Lee said at the United Nations that the West was morally obliged to make sure China keeps its 1984 treaty promises that Hong Kong will remain a free capitalist society.
""It becomes the moral obligation of every government that supported the (treaty) at least to ensure that China will adhere to her promises made in 1984 and keep Hong Kong free,"" he said.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after meeting Lee that she plans to attend the Hong Kong handover ceremony this year, and warned that Washington was watching.
""I will emphasise America's continued involvement in protecting our interests and supporting Hong Kong's people as they enter the Chinese nation,"" she said.
Meanwhile, the pace of politics in Hong Kong was quickening.
On Tuesday, the two countries clinched an agreement to let China's People's Liberation Army send 40 troops into Hong Kong next Monday to start getting facilities ready for the future Chinese garrison.
On Wednesday, the two sides agreed to sell 98 hectares of government land to boost the supply of development land, which should help to ease a chronically tight housing supply.
Police forces in Hong Kong and China also agreed to step up joint efforts to combat a tidal wave of illegal immigration into the territory involving mainly children and pregnant women.
But on Monday, China angered Britain by unilaterally setting rules on who will have permanent residency rights in Hong Kong after July 1. Britain said the ""right of abode"" decision should have been taken jointly through diplomatic negotiations.
Beijing wanted to force Britain to recognise a China-appointed legislature by agreeing to let the body process the new residency law, senior officials told Reuters.
"
PeterHumphrey,"Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party on Thursday welcomed a pledge from the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, that people would keep their basic freedoms after China takes over on July 1.
But some activists staged a noisy protest disrupting a meeting staged by Tung's aides to tap the public's views on his controversial plan to whittle down civil liberties.
A new opinion poll, meanwhile, indicated nine in 10 of Hong Kong students do not believe China will really allow the territory its promised autonomy after Britain hands it back.
Fears have been rising in Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years and now with 6.4 million people, that the territory will suffer a loss of freedom after the handover.
Tung on Wednesday vigorously defended proposed curbs on the right to demonstrate and on foreign funding of political groups, saying laws in the United States were much tougher.
""The majority of cities in North America, including New York, Washington and San Francisco, all require police permission before demonstrations can be held,"" he said.
""Let me assure you the (future) government has the strongest determination to preserve the freedoms that the people of Hong Kong currently enjoy,"" Tung said in a dinner speech.
""Peaceful and lawful demonstrations can and must be allowed to continue. I see public demonstration as a way for people to express their views, and public demonstrations are now a part of Hong Kong culture,"" he said.
Anthony Cheung, vice president of the Democratic Party cautiously welcomed Tung's assurances, the first public comment Tung has made on the proposals launched last week.
""We welcome this pledge that the right to protest, the right to demonstrate, the freedom of assembly and association, all of these are people's rights and should be part of Hong Kong's political culture,"" Cheung told Hong Kong radio.
""But we question a lot of the substance of Mr Tung's proposals on how to amend the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance,"" he said. ""Some of these proposals have in fact infringed the rights that Mr Tung was talking about.""
About 16 pro-democracy councillors waved banners and shouted slogans, disrupting a public consultation on the plan at Hong Kong's Space Museum on Thursday. They then walked out of the meeting, attended by 50 members of local councils.
""We believe this is a fake consultation,"" said councillor Ng Wing-fai. ""The members of the future government already have a basic line and the basic principles will not be changed.""
Colonial Governor Chris Patten made clear on Wednesday that Britain would not back down on an issue at the heart of handover quarrels with China -- a shadow legislature that China has appointed to replace the current, elected Legislative Council.
Patten opposed calls to allow the China-appointed body to pass a law on residency rights before the hand-back to China.
His comment followed a row this week when China announced rules on who would qualify for ""right of abode"" -- permanent residency -- in Hong Kong after the handover.
But a pro-China group on Thursday marched to Government House, Patten's residence, to rebuke the government for not cooperating with the future administration, the local Pearl television station reported.
Brandishing banners and chanting slogans, members of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong said they wanted the interim chamber to pass the right of abode bill.
Beijing plans to submit the bill before June 30 to its Hong Kong provisional legislature.
The government said if the bill were to be handled before July 1 by the interim body it would be legally challenged.

PeterHumphrey,"A page of history is set to turn when Chinese troops enter Hong Kong on Monday to prepare for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) after Britain marches out of the territory in July.
The 40-strong advance party led by Major-General Zhou Borong will arrive in the colony on British Queen Elizabeth's birthday. They will drive into Hong Kong from China's Shenzhen region in full uniform but unarmed.
The PLA advance guard will be the first Chinese troops ever to be stationed on Hong Kong island.
Eight PLA staff cars and trucks will enter at the Lok Ma Chau land crossing at around lunchtime (0500 GMT).
They will drive the 30 km (19 miles) to the Prince of Wales Barracks in downtown Hong Kong, arriving soon after British troops fire a 21-gun salute marking the Queen's birthday.
The advance party will be the first of up to 10,000 PLA troops who will form the Hong Kong garrison after Britain returns its last Asian colony -- a bustling capitalist outpost of 6.4 million people -- to Communist-ruled China at midnight on June 30.
Up to 200 advance troops are expected to arrive before the handover. By that day, Britain will have phased out its garrison forces, which were once 10,000-strong in the territory.
The last of the famed ""Black Watch"" highlanders regiment will depart just after the midnight flag change.
""This is an historic event,"" Edward Ho, a legislator of the relatively pro-China Liberal Party, told reporters.
But the anti-Communist Democratic Party, which received the largest number of votes in the 1995 elections, disagreed.
""This entry has little significance or excitement. The soldiers will keep a very low profile,"" said the party's security spokesman James To.
It will be the first quasi-sovereign presence China has been allowed in the transition towards handover.
Beijing is currently represented in Hong Kong by its Xinhua News Agency, by a diplomatic establishment known as the Joint Liaison Group, and by a large array of mainland companies.
British authorities said the PLA group will get no special treatment at the frontier. They will go through normal customs and immigration controls and then find their own way from the border to the Prince of Wales Barracks, where 28 of them will be billeted. Twelve will stay on nearby Stonecutters Island, where Britain recently closed its Tamar Naval base.
""The soldiers will be unarmed and are here to carry out practical preparations for the PLA to take over responsibility for the defence of Hong Kong on July 1,"" British armed forces spokesman Roger Goodwin told Reuters.
General Zhou will be greeted at the barracks by British garrison commander, Major-General Bryan Dutton.
""They will be greeted with normal courtesies, handshakes and salutes,"" Goodwin said.
""It is in the best long-term interests of the people of Hong Kong that there should be a smooth transfer of defence responsibilities to the PLA,"" he said.
""The British garrison looks forward to working with the advance party to help ensure a successful transfer. The future PLA garrison inherits a proud tradition from the British Hong Kong garrison, a success story which we will do everything to help them continue.""
Many of Hong Kong's people are disturbed by the imminent arrival of an army whose tanks crushed the student-led democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
China has gone to pains in recent months to soothe those anxieties with a PLA campaign at their interim base over the border in Shenzhen, parading elite troops and stressing their qualities of virtue, discipline and high education.

PeterHumphrey,"An American businessman is plotting a marketing revolution in the hospitality sector and aims to house U.S. pioneers in the China market.
Corporate housing specialist Howard Ruby says he aims to turn the business of letting serviced apartments into a full-fledged industry that will provide everything from Internet terminals in the home to child care and jobs for expatriate spouses.
FROM POOR COUSIN OF HOTELS TO A GLOBAL SERVICE
Until recently the sector providing ready-to-live-in, service-provided, short-term apartments was a poor cousin of hotels, and in many cities of the world it still is.
""This whole industry has been below the radar screen over the last twenty years, being done by a mama and papa, or a small operator that operates one building at a time,"" said Ruby.
""And now we're seeing an industry evolve because of the needs of corporate clients as business globalises around the world,"" the head of Los Angeles-based Oakwood International said in an interview at a recent hotel industry conference.
EYES ON ASIA AND CHINA MARKETS
Ruby's group recently launched a joint venture with a subsidiary of Australia-listed Lend Lease in Singapore with plans to provide 10,000 serviced apartments in Asia, and intends to take aim at London during the next year.
Ruby foresees large-scale expansion in the sector in the Far East, especially in China, with much of American industry abuzz with plans to move people into the region.
Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have large expatriate populations as well as large numbers of home-grown professionals moving around the country on assignment who need temporary serviced housing.
""I just finished a tour of major client companies in the United States. Every single one is planning an expansion into the Far East, with most of them talking about China.
""Telecommunications, software companies, all the way through to clothing and furniture manufacturers. They're all talking China right now. Whereas a company might have sent 10 people last year, they're expecting to send over 20 people this coming year,"" he said.
The serviced apartment industry is starting to break away from the niche market identity and family-style business of old into a multifaceted service industry, Ruby believes.
CORPORATE RELOCATIONS PROVIDE HUGE MARKET POTENTIAL
Oakwood is the largest national provider of serviced apartments in the United States, with offices in 60 cities, more than 17,000 apartments and 25,000 clients including 400 of the Fortune 500 companies and 75 of the world's top multinationals.
The potential of the business is highlighted by one client that carries out 50,000 relocations of staff a year, with an average three months stay in temporary housing, Ruby said.
A company like General Motors, for example, might need help with relocation or temporary housing for staff moved around on training, special projects like setting up new production lines and might put out 25,000 apartment requirements a year.
Ruby started out catering to the niche market of new college graduates three decades ago -- apartments for baby boomers.
He moved on to corporate housing when companies asked for more services, such as maid service and taking care of bills.
SERVICED APARTMENTS TO BECOME MULTIFACETED SERVICE
He sees the business progressing to include video conferencing, Internet hookups, sports and recreation facilities, orientation tours, child care and job search agencies for spouses.
""This way a serviced apartment offers a branded service dedicated to the needs of the corporate customer. They are not just a physical facility, but a service provider,"" he said.
""Companies do not want staff transfers to end in failure because of a dissatisfied spouse. So we want to provide a service that makes a transfer a success.""
With an increasingly cluttered market, customers looked now to a reputable brand as their one point of contact, Ruby said.
DEALS IN THE PIPELINE IN ASIA
In the Far East, Oakwood and partners are working on deals in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila and Bangkok.
The first Asian project to go onstream will be Oakwood Premier, a serviced apartment scheme in Shanghai's historic Xuhui district, where the French concession was located in pre-revolutionary times. The property, owned by a Hong Kong family, will open later this year.
""As the industry matures in Asia, dedicated service companies will be the providers of choice for the corporations leasing the majority of serviced apartments,"" Ruby said.

PeterHumphrey,"Britain's minister handling Hong Kong's 1997 transfer to China will confer with London's colonial governor and other officials this weekend after opening the way to a breakthrough in handover arrangements with Beijing.
Jeremy Hanley, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, arrives in Hong Kong on Friday night to discuss the state of play in negotiations following his recent visit to Beijing, which was marked by a warming of relations.
Hanley, wrapping up a tour of Asia, will meet Governor Chris Patten and the territory's quasi cabinet, the Executive Council, to brief them on his recent talks with China's Hong Kong policy supremo Lu Ping.
They would also discuss how Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind would handle his next meeting with China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, likely to take place at the United Nations General Assembly session in New York later this month.
A well-placed western diplomatic source said Hanley's talks in China had produced progress on the long-stalled and thorny issue of a joint handover ceremony when a century and a half of British rule ends, at midnight next June 30.
""The main thing was that he made good progress on the handover ceremony, and an announcement on this could come quite soon,"" the diplomatic source said.
A deal on the ceremony in 291 days' time to mark this closing chapter of Britain's empire was now very close, the source said. He added that there was some hope that Britain's Prince Charles might attend.
A government spokesman said Hanley's visit to Hong Kong was a ""pulse-feeling mission"" and that Patten was keen to hear first hand about the latest contacts with Lu Ping.
Hanley arrives in Hong Kong on the eve of the departure of Britain's diplomatic negotiating team to Beijing for a session of the Joint Liaison Group forum haggling over the handover.
This year had seen a significant shift to cordial relations between Britain and China, the diplomatic source said.
Progress was made on ""substantive economic issues"", although on the political front less had been achieved, he said.
London and Beijing have long bickered over the transition, with discord over the handover ceremony once so entrenched that prospects of a joint ceremony seemed in doubt. China, infuriated by Patten's expansion of democracy in the colony, was once said to have insisted that he should not attend.
But Lu told Hanley in Beijing he would seal the handover next year in a ceremonial handshake with Patten.
Another obstacle has been China's plan to dissolve Hong Kong's elected Legislative council and supplant it with an appointed ""provisional legislature"", which Britain opposes.
""China has managed to change the tone of its approach to Hong Kong without shifting its stance on the provisional legislature,"" the diplomatic source said.
Recently political analysts have noted softer Chinese policy utterances on Hong Kong, including offers of dialogue with the Democratic Party, long a fierce critic of Beijing, and an attempt to inject more candidates into the contest for the territory's first post-colonial leader, or Chief Executive.
An unprecedented exchange of letters between the Democrats and China this month came after the British side encouraged the party to open a dialogue with the Chinese and China to be more receptive to the group, a Hong Kong official said on Friday.
China has promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under the handover treaty with Britain, and no change to the colony's freewheeling capitalist system for 50 years under a ""one country two systems"" policy aimed at reunifying Chinese territories.
"
PeterHumphrey,"Hong Kong's future government has hit a new snag, with a shortage of trained staff forcing it to cancel a sitting of a controversial legislature preparing new laws ahead of the territory's handover to China.
It is the latest in a series of difficulties facing Tung Chee-hwa, the China-backed shipping magnate who will rule Hong Kong after the British pull out at midnight on June 30.
Tung's office said on Wednesday that this Saturday's session of the provisional legislature, which had been scheduled to deal with a draft law on new flags, had been dropped from the diary. Just a briefing would take place.
""The draft bills aren't ready because there aren't enough people,"" Bob Howlett, a spokesman for Tung's office, told Reuters. He said Tung's coordinator, Michael Suen, concluded the office did not have enough draftsmen to prepare planned laws.
""He doesn't want to see a rushed job done on anything,"" Howlett said.
But Tung's office issued a statement saying the bills would be passed in good time before the July 1 handover.
""We are doing the best we can with our limited resources. We are firmly committed to completing the drafting of all essential bills in good time for their passage by the Provisional Legislature Council before July 1.""
British Governor Chris Patten has refused to second more staff to the Tung office from the Hong Kong civil service to help the future government ready itself for the handover.
The office has only two law drafters on its staff.
Communist-ruled China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, a British colony for the last 156 years, under a 1984 treaty that allows the territory virtual autonomy for another 50 years.
China, angered by democratic reforms introduced by Patten in the twilight years of British rule, set up the provisional legislature in December to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council (Legco).
Many of China's critics consider the interim body unconstitutional.
""I think it's a good thing there's now no legislation going forward this week, and it would be even better if no legislation goes forward at any time, because anything they do handle between now and June 30 is vulnerable to legal challenge after the first of July,"" said Patten's spokesman, Kerry McGlynn.
""That can't be in anybody's interests. We've always made it perfectly plain, and will continue to do so up to June 30, that we'll do nothing to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the current Legco by providing any kind of assistance to the provisional legislature,"" McGlynn told Reuters.
A spokesman for the provisional legislature said the body would now organise a briefing on Saturday on the planned civil rights curbs, instead of a full-fledged legislative session, at its base in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen.
Tung's run-up to his new job as Hong Kong chief executive has been a bumpy one.
Sino-British disputes were stoked this month after Tung launched a plan to curb political liberties such as the right to protest and the right of political groups to receive foreign funds. He provoked a domestic and international outcry.
Last week he admitted to the media that he had donated 50,000 stg ($81,500) to the ruling British Conservative Party in 1992, sparking cries of hypocrisy.

PeterHumphrey,"Hong Kong's future government has hit a new snag, with a shortage of trained staff forcing it to cancel a sitting of a controversial legislature preparing new laws ahead of the territory's handover to China.
It is the latest in a series of difficulties facing Tung Chee-hwa, the China-backed shipping magnate who will rule Hong Kong after the British pull out at midnight on June 30.
Tung's office said on Wednesday  thatthis Saturday's session of the provisional legislature, which had been scheduled to deal with a draft law on new flags, had been dropped from the diary. Just a briefing would take place.
""The draft bills aren't ready because there aren't enough people,"" Bob Howlett, a spokesman for Tung's office, told Reuters. He said Tung's coordinator, Michael Suen, concluded the office did not have enough draftsmen to prepare planned laws.
""He doesn't want to see a rushed job done on anything,"" Howlett said.
British Governor Chris Patten has refused to second more staff to the Tung office from the Hong Kong civil service to help the future government ready itself for the handover.
The office has only two law drafters on its staff.
Communist-ruled China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, a British colony for the last 156 years, under a 1984 treaty that allows the territory virtual autonomy for another 50 years.
China, angered by democratic reforms introduced by Patten in the twilight years of British rule, set up the provisional legislature in December to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council (Legco).
Many of China's critics consider the interim body unconstitutional.
""I think it's a good thing there's now no legislation going forward this week, and it would be even better if no legislation goes forward at any time, because anything they do handle between now and June 30 is vulnerable to legal challenge after the first of July,"" said Patten's spokesman, Kerry McGlynn.
""That can't be in anybody's interests. We've always made it perfectly plain, and will continue to do so up to June 30, that we'll do nothing to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the current Legco by providing any kind of assistance to the provisional legislature,"" McGlynn told Reuters.

""They seem they can't get their act together,"" a government official said of the latest setback. ""Tung's office is finding it nigh impossible to do the drafting, even though they still seem determined to go head with it.
""The Chinese side has painted itself into a corner with the provisional legislature. They've got themselves into a real pickle.""

PeterHumphrey,"Rights groups and academics warned of threats to freedom in Hong Kong on Tuesday, while a pro-China politician denied that proposed curbs to civil liberties would strangle the territory after Beijing takes over.
Hong Kong's 156 years under the British flag come to an end when the territory reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 and, with 63 days to go, the pace of political debate is quickening.
Human Rights Watch/Asia said changes to China's criminal code had made it easier for Beijing to stifle dissent, and Hong Kong people might even be put on trial in China.
A public consultation on the future of political freedom in the colony ends on Wednesday, and the bustling capitalist outpost's 6.4 million people are sharply divided.
The pulse-taking, launched by Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa, asks members of the public and organisations to submit views on his plan to ban foreign funding of political groups and curb the right to protest in the interests of ""national security"".
Hong Kong academics waded into the fray on Tuesday by saying the proposed rules on political groups posed a threat to freedom of association, the interpretation of foreign meddling was flawed and too much interpretation was left to authorities.
""This is tantamount to opening the door to abuse in the future,"" the statement, signed by 150 scholars, said.
Pro-democracy parties, the legal profession, human rights groups, Western-style trade unions and churches have objected to Tung's plan in written submissions, and there has been loud criticism from London and Washington.
But organisations representing industry, commerce, pro-China political parties and pro-Beijing trade unions support the plan, which was forced on Tung by a Chinese parliamentary resolution.
Pro-China politician Maria Tam told a business audience on Tuesday that Tung's proposal to curb civil and political liberties was not an attack on human rights.
""Tung Chee-hwa is not trying to strangle human rights here,"" Tam told the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in a speech.
Tam, a leading member of China's Preparatory Committee, which is charged with setting up the post-handover political system, said similar restrictions existed in the United States, Canada, Australia and other Western states.
In the latest twist, a powerful pro-Beijing labour group, the Federation of Trade Unions, called for a widening of definitions of political groups covered by the curbs.
But in an unusual move, the federation also called for a ban on funding from China's ruling Communist Party to local political groups to be added to the restrictions. The move would ""avoid disputes and criticisms"", union boss Cheng Yiu-tong said.
Pro-democracy trade union federation leader Lee Cheuk-yan attacked the bid to widen the net.
""(It) is a step backward, because they want to have more organisations defined as political groups,"" Lee told Reuters. ""They want to pressure these organisations to depoliticise.""
Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a report on Tuesday that China's striking of the term ""counterrevolution"" -- the communist code for subversion -- from the law books in March did not mean easing political controls. Quite the opposite.
""China has merely replaced the term 'counterrevolution' with the equally elastic notion of 'endangering state security' and has, in the process, actually broadened the capacity of the state to suppress dissent,"" the report said.
Hong Kong people, who China has vowed can keep their legal system and way of life for 50 years, could suffer, it said.
""Despite Hong Kong's separate legal system, Beijing may have the power to bring Hong Kong people to face trial in mainland courts,"" it said.
"
PeterHumphrey,"Human rights and political liberty took centre stage in Hong Kong on Tuesday as human rights watchdogs said China was making it easier to crush dissent, boding ill for the territory after Beijing takes over.
After 156 years under the British flag, Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 -- 63 days away -- and the pace of politics is quickening.
The watchdog Human Rights Watch/Asia said changes to China's criminal code had made it easier for Beijing to stifle dissent, and Hong Kong people might even be put on trial in China.
In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks on contentious issues but there was no shift in views on human rights or the future of Hong Kong, a Chinese spokesman said.
A major ""public consultation"" on the future of political freedom in the colony ends on Wednesday, and the bustling capitalist outpost's 6.4 million people are sharply divided.

But in an unusual move, the federation also called for a ban on funding from China's ruling Communist Party to local political groups to be added to the restrictions.
""This will avoid disputes and criticisms. Hong Kong's political groups should stand on their own feet to fight for their beliefs,"" said the union's boss, Cheng Yiu-tong.
Cheng's rival, pro-democracy trade union federation leader Lee Cheuk-yan, attacked Cheng's bid to widen the net.
""(It) is a step backward, because they want to have more organisations defined as political groups,"" Lee told Reuters. ""They want to pressure these organisations to depoliticise.""
Tung's future Justice Secretary, Elsie Leung, said she was willing to consider calls for a ban on mainland funding.
Such funding had not originally been mentioned because it was considered that the national security interests of Hong Kong and mainland organisations converged.
""But we will consider this proposal as so many people have raised it,"" she said at a function on Monday.
Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a major report on Tuesday that China's striking of the term ""counterrevolution"", the communist code for subversion, from the law books in March did not mean easing political controls. Quite the opposite.

"
PeterHumphrey,"A vow by future leader Tung Chee-hwa that there will be no ""Tiananmen"" crackdowns in Hong Kong after China takes over drew a muted welcome on Wednesday from the territory's leading democracy advocate.
But Martin Lee, leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, urged Tung to match words with deeds.
Tung vowed on the U.S. ABC News ""Nightline"" television programme on Tuesday to protect the right to protest and said no such repression as occurred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989 would happen in Hong Kong under his leadership.
The British colony reverts to China at midnight on June 30, and the memory of the Tiananmen massacre, when Chinese tanks crushed a student-led democracy movement in 1989, remains vivid for Hong Kong's 6.4 million people.
Tung's remark came on the last day of a pulse-taking exercise in which the public has been consulted on his plan to curb freedoms, such as the right to protest.
Asked if the Tiananmen Square crackdown could be repeated in Hong Kong, Tung said: ""No, it can't happen here. It will not happen here. I will not allow it to happen here.""
""Demonstration is part of our culture, demonstration is part of life...they will be free to demonstrate as they please, but I would hope they would abide by the laws of Hong Kong if they wish to do so,"" Tung said.
Lee welcomed the pledge but said words were not enough.
""My Democratic Party colleagues and I await Mr Tung's matching words with action and leaving Hong Kong's laws on assembly and other freedoms intact,"" Lee told Reuters.
Lee said Tung's comment contradicted the essence of Tung's plans to curb civil rights after China takes over.
""This is an encouraging statement from our Chief Executive-designate Mr Tung Chee-hwa which recognises the reality that Hong Kong is a free society where people regularly exercise their right to demonstrate peacefully within the law,"" Lee said.
""But there is a significant discrepancy between what Mr Tung is saying...and what he has proposed doing.""
China's parliament has declared null and void Hong Kong's existing laws on public order and lawful assembly, once the flag is changed at midnight on June 30.
Tung's civil liberties plan includes slapping a ban on foreign funding of political groups and making it obligatory to obtain police permission to stage protests.
Pro-democracy parties, lawyers, human rights groups, unions and churches have vigorously objected to Tung's plan in written submissions. Washington and London have also criticised it.
But groups representing industry, commerce, pro-China parties and pro-Beijing trade unions support the plan.
In a separate development, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen issued assurances on Tuesday that Hong Kong would retain great autonomy ""unmatched in the world"".
""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, including the executive power, legislative power and independent judicial power and the power of final trial,"" Qian said during a visit to Washington.
The Hong Kong government applauded Qian's remark. ""The government welcomes this reassurance,"" a spokeswoman said.
An official of China's Hong Kong And China Macau Affairs Office in Beijing declined to comment on Tung's pledge to protect civil rights in the territory after the handover, saying such matters were none of Beijing's business.
""Beijing is responsible for the defence and foreign affairs of Hong Kong after it returns to Chinese rule,"" he said.
""Everything else is the responsibility of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""

PierreTran,"France said on Friday it would not allow Britain's General Electric Co Plc (GEC) to bid for the state's stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF for national security reasons.
GEC said it regretted the rejection but indicated it had not given up, saying it was talking to two French groups which are allowed to bid -- missiles-to-publishing group Lagardere Groupe and Alcatel Alsthom, an electronics and engineering company.
The Finance Ministry said it had received offers for the 58 percent stake from Lagardere and Alcatel, which is bidding with defence company Dassault Industrie.
""The government has declared as admissable the proposals by Lagardere Groupe and the one by Alcatel Alsthom and Dassault Industrie,"" the Ministry said in a statement.
""However, because the sale to a foreign company of more than 50 percent of the share capital of Thomson-CSF goes against the interests of national security, the proposal by GEC has not been admitted,"" it added.
Industry Minister Franck Borotra told French television that GEC could still play a role in the Thonson-CSF privatisation if it found common ground with either of the French bidders.
""GEC, which believes it can play an important role in this restructuring, has to approach the two candidates which have been admitted to see what kind of agreement, what kind of negotiations can take place about the place they can have in the restructuring of the European defence industry around Thomson-CSF,"" Borotra told LCI television in an interview.
London analysts say it was never likely GEC would be allowed to win the tender over French companies. But they say it might yet gain a stake by teaming up with a French partner.
GEC said it had bid for Thomson because it believed it could be brought together with GEC-Marconi to create a world leader in defence electronics and enable Europe to compete better with U.S. companies.
""The fragmented structure of the European defence electronics industry will not sustain a strong competitive position in world markets in the next century,"" it said.
""This can be achieved only through an integrated electronics defence capability efficient in its operations and effective in the deployment of its resources,"" GEC said.
In Paris, the ministry said the government had encouraged the accepted candidates to set out their plans for French and European industrial partnerships when they submitted final offers for Thomson-CSF.
Firm offers are due by May 7 and the government hopes to make a decision by the end of June.
Last year, Lagardere and its South Korean ally Daewoo Electronics won the bidding for Thomson-CSF's then parent, Thomson SA, beating Alcatel.
Thomson SA held the state stake in Thomson-CSF and all of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
But the government suspended the deal in December after the independent Privatisation Commission objected to the terms of TMM's sale to Daewoo.

One defence consultant in Paris said that GEC's bid had been a bold move to ""flush out"" France's strategy in its defence restructuring.
GEC and other British firms wanted to know whether e France was ready for a transnational restructuring, which would build European groups strong enough to compete with U.S. giants such as Lockheed Martin and merger partners Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
That integrated model could include the Airbus Industrie civil aircraft consortium, which groups France's Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa) and Casa of Spain.
The alternative was more modest collaboration with joint ventures. ""It's about control,"" said the consultant, who requested anonymity. GEC's move had been a test of whether the French were willing to give up their 51 percent majority in defence companies.
The answer came back loud and clear on Friday: no.
An investment banker close to the Thomson-CSF sale said GEC was in a strong position as it had ties to both Lagardere and Alcatel. It could, for example, negotiate a big slice of Thomson-CSF after the company was sold to one of the French companies.
Last year, Lagardere and its South Korean ally Daewoo Electronics won the bidding for Thomson-CSF's then parent, Thomson SA , beating Alcatel.
Thomson SA controls consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).

PierreTran,"France's second rebuff in a week to British group General Electric Co Plc (GEC) -- this time over nuclear merger talks -- underscores its concerns over controlling strategic industries, analysts say.
State-controlled nuclear engineering firm Framatome said on Monday its main shareholders had told it that a mooted merger between Framatome and Anglo-French joint venture GEC Alsthom was unlikely.
GEC, an engineering and electronics company, had wanted 50 percent of the new group but that this was contrary to the French government's wishes, it said.
Framatome's statement follows Friday's refusal by the French government to allow GEC to bid in the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF -- again because the state was not prepared to sell a half share to a foreign firm.
""It's about control,"" said one restructuring specialist who declined to be identified.
Concerns over industrial leadership are a common thread in the French government's thinking, while British managers are seeking to improve shareholder returns, analysts said.
Majority ownership of at least 51 percent is the least the French government seems willing to contemplate in strategic sectors, analysts said. But even where ownership is split 50-50 -- as in the GEC Alsthom engineering group -- the French still effectively held control, the restructuring expert said.
""Strategically the U.K. companies, on behalf of their shareholders, are saying 'We can't justfify any more 49s or 50/50s that don't have some element of operational control, because we don't think shareholder returns are actually maximised in that way,"" he said.
GEC Alsthom is jointly owned by GEC and Alcatel Alsthom. It makes power generating plants and France's high-speed TGV trains, and had been in talks to merge with Framatome. Alcatel owns 44 percent of Framatome directly.
France, whose first attempt to privatise the Thomson parent company collapsed last year when a South Korean company's involvement failed to get past the privatisation watchdog, raised the issue of foreign ownership again on Friday when it rejected a bid by GEC.
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis insisted on Saturday that Paris was open to foreign firms taking part in French bids for the state's 58 percent in Thomson-CSF. ""The government is ready to examine offers which include partnerships,"" he said.
He indicated that a foreign partnership would help France's ambition to create a big European defence company strong enough to rival the U.S. titans.
But analysts say France, while wanting a European defence restructuring, is determined to stay in the pilot's seat.
The government says Alcatel and missiles-to-publishing firm Lagardere are eligible to bid for Thomson-CSF and is encouraging GEC to talk to them as they prepare final offers.
An investment banker close to the Thomson-CSF sale said the British business approach was essentially pragmatic and driven by bottom-line considerations.
It was not inconceivable, given weak margins and the strength of GEC Alsthom's competitors, that GEC could one day sell its share in the joint venture to Alcatel, the banker said.
GEC Alsthom competes with the likes of U.S. General Electric Co, the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri joint venture and Siemens AG of Germany.
"
PierreTran,"Air France announced on Monday the start of a transatlantic alliance with two major U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines and Continental, as part of a strategy to form global links vital to the French state-owned carrier's future.
Delta and Continental  unveiled registration facilities at Air France's central hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, marking the official transfer of flights and operations from Paris Orly airport.
The alliances were announced last October.
Under the move, Air France's global hub at Charles de Gaulle is now linked to five major U.S. hubs -- New York's JFK airport, Atlanta and Cincinnati belonging to Delta and New York-Newark and Houston belonging to Continental.
""Through our partnership with Air France, we see a very good opportunity to flow traffic over the Delta hubs in the U.S. to Paris and beyond (the) Air France CDG hub,"" Bob Coggins, Delta's executive vice president for marketing told reporters.
Besides the move from Orly to the more modern and spacious facilities at Charles de Gaulle, the alliances allow the U.S. and French firms to share Frequent Flyer programmes and share revenues on feeder and transatlantic flights.
The main benefit will come when Air France links its schedules with Delta and Continental through a formal code-sharing programme, Barry Simon, Continental's senior vice president international said.
Code-sharing allows one airline to issue a through ticket using a connecting flight on its partner's network. Such deals can significantly increase traffic at low cost.
But Air France cannot sign up a code-sharing pact until the French and U.S. governments agree a bilateral air treaty. The U.S. authorities seek substantial liberalisation, including the right to fly from a domestic city to France and onward to a destination in a third country.
""We took into account what we could do, and we did it,"" Air France deputy managing director Christian Kozar said. ""Thanks to Air France, Charles de Gaulle will be - and already is - the world's entry point for Europe. If the Americans choose Charles de Gaulle, it is for the long term.""
Air France Aviation, a staff newspaper, said the airline hopes to agree as many Delta and Continental code-shares as possible by the end of 1997.
Continental's Simon said he was not aware of the details of the intergovernmental talks but said, ""I see no reason why it can't be done.""
The U.S. partnerships and Air France's new summer schedule are expected to increase Air France's traffic this year by 20 percent, equally split between the two factors, Kozar said. That will follow a 20 percent increase in the first year of hub operations in 1996, he added.
The alliances should add $100 million to Air France's annual revenues, Yves Abbas, Air France hub coordinator said.
Delta is particularly looking to develop business using Air France's network in the Middle East and Africa, said Coggins. Eventually, it hopes to increase the frequency of flights to Paris, he said.
More than three million passengers travel between the United States and France every year.
Both U.S. airlines said they were confident Air France could overcome its labour problems encountered in its merger with Air France Europe, adding that U.S. companies faced disputes when the U.S. system was deregulated in the 1980s.
"
PierreTran,"France's restructuring of its defence sector and the key role of state-owned Aerospatiale in that process are complicating the change in the European Airbus consortium into a limited liability company, analysts said.
The four national firms in Airbus Industrie are studying the best way to convert the partnership into a faster, more efficient company, better to compete with U.S. rival Boeing Co, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas.
Aerospatiale is not only the French partner in the Airbus passenger plane venture but is also involved in the two deals at the heart of France's defence industry consolidation -- the merger of Aerospatiale and combat plane maker Dassault Aviation and the privatisation of electronics firm Thomson-CSF .
""It is consistent with French strategic thinking that you must first get your house in order, then negotiate from a position of strength,"" said an industry executive.
""Aerospatiale cannot do this today in the Airbus system. It has to have weight behind it. It will have that weight when the Dassault merger is complete,"" he added. DASSAULT MERGER WILL BOOST AEROSPATIALE
The Dassault merger, due to be agreed this year, will add 13 billion francs of annual turnover to Aerospatiale, creating a group with combined sales of 64 billion and giving Aerospatiale greater clout at the Airbus negotiating table.
A banker close to the Airbus talks said Aerospatiale is seen as the weakest among the senior Airbus partners -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Casa of Spain makes up the fourth Airbus partner.
But Aerospatiale will get an injection of aggressive, private-sector management with the Dassault merger.
Aerospatiale executives complain bitterly that the foreign media does not give them due credit for their industrial restructuring. Their efforts turned the company round to post a 1996 net attributable profit of 812 million francs, after years of losses, and racked up sales of 51 billion francs.
Their exasperation is palpable when they say their public sector tag is seen as a weakness when compared to the private sector BAe and Dasa.
But analysts point out that Aerospatiale was slower in attacking its cost structure and still needs to improve.
BAe underwent drastic pruning in the early 1990s, going from an empire with property, cars and military interests to a group focused on defence and aerospace. It posted 1996 pretax profits of 425 million pounds, on sales of 7.44 billion pounds.
Dasa, although loss-making, has the industrial and financial strength of parent Daimler-Benz AG which has set a management target of a 12 percent return on capital. Dasa posted 1996 turnover of 13 billion marks, making it smaller than BAe and Aerospatiale, but it has huge ambitions for Airbus.
A business consultant said Aerospatiale has excellent programmes, but, using benchmarking techniques, its military projects are 30 percent more costly than those of BAe and Dasa. THOMSON-CSF SALE ENHANCES PROSPECTS
Apart from the Dassault merger, Aerospatiale also holds a key hand in the Thomson-CSF sell-off.
The government has said bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere will have to take into account Aerospatiale's interests when putting together their offers for Thomson-CSF.
Even though Aerospatiale, as a state-controlled company, cannot take part direcly in the privatisation, it will be affected by the outcome and chairman Yves Michot will give his views to the government on the rival bids.
French newspapers have reported that Michot will have to observe strict neutrality in the contest. But it is clear Alcatel's plans would significantly strengthen Aerospatiale, giving it still greater weight against BAe and Dasa.
If Alcatel won Thomson-CSF, it would create a missiles joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, and a satellite venture between Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF.
Lagardere has said it wants a dialogue with Aerospatiale to prepare its bid. Relations between the two firms have been strained as they compete in missiles and satellites.
""The perimeter of Aerospatiale is not yet defined,"" said the industry executive.
The government plans to decide on the Thomson-CSF bids by June 30. AEROSPATIALE NEEDS AIRBUS, WILL MAKE IT WORK
Aerospatiale only stands to gain from the defence moves and is in no hurry to bow to pressures from BAe and Dasa to rush into an Airbus agreement which does not suit its own interests.
Airbus is vitally important for Aerospatiale. Its 38 percent stake in Airbus contributed the biggest slice of 1996 operating profit, 1.175 billion francs, and around 70 percent of sales.
Analysts believe of the big Airbus three, Aerospatiale needs Airbus the most, and BAe and Dasa could, in extremis, walk away if relations broke down irreparably.
BAe has a 20 percent Airbus stake and has bigger military interests, while Dasa's parent Daimler-Benz gets most of its money from the auto business, through Mercedes trucks and cars.
Aerospatiale has, paradoxically, maximalist and minimalist aims for the new Airbus company.
For the near term, Michot takes a cautious approach in the status change, arguing that the present system has proven its worth, winning Airbus a third of the world market, coming out of nowhere in 25 years. A much bigger manufacturing concern would overstretch the management.
In the long term however, Michot would like Airbus to have a military wing, to balance out economic cycles with government contracts. U.S. giant Lockheed Martin has both civil and defence sides, and Boeing will acquire McDonnell's significant military interests in the pending merger.
The Airbus partners said in January they agreed in principle on the change to a single integrated company, in which the new Airbus would own its factories and design offices. Work is going on this year on valuing the assets to be vested in the new firm.
That valuation is complicated as some of the factories mix civil and military programmes, and some plants are efficient while others are uncompetitive. In BAe's case this is made easy as it has a plant for making Airbus wings, and Dasa has a special production line near Hamburg for the Airbus 320 family.
One way of viewing the Airbus negotiations is through the prism of conflicting cultural visions.
""This country (France) has a vision of long-term industrial strategy. It wants to be a world power and be a dominant player in the aircraft industry,"" said the industry executive. Without that vision, Airbus arguably would never have got funds to launch its first plane in the early 1970s.
Set against that long-term strategic view, is the British insistence on short-term returns for shareholders, summed up as ""Let the City decide"".
But Aerospatiale would not have signed the agreement on the Airbus change if it had not meant it, the executive said.

PierreTran,"Holding company Cie de Suez  and utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux SA are expected to announce a merger deal on Friday, effectively ending the independence of the company created in the 19th century to build the Suez Canal.
The boards of the two companies will meet on Friday to approve terms of the link-up, which has already received the backing of the Lyonnaise board.
Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod said last Thursday that the merger with Suez was an excellent plan but the terms had not yet been fixed.
However, a source close to the merger talks told Reuters on Thursday that the share parity to be used would be 41 Suez shares for every 20 Lyonnaise shares.
Suez stock was down 0.04 percent at 282.90 francs ($48.79) on volume of 171,495 shares, while Lyonnaise was down 0.37 percent at 540. The market was off 0.63 percent.
Suez would also pay out either 3.6 or 3.8 billion francs for the 1996 dividend, the source added.
The deal would mark the end of autonomy for Suez, which fell victim in the 1990s to a troubled property market.
It was founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps to build and operate the property asset which symbolised the glory of the French Empire and engineering, the Suez Canal.
Discontented Suez shareholders forced out the previous chairman, Gerard Worms, after the group reported a four billion franc ($690 million at current rates) loss in 1995 and installed Gerard Mestrallet to turn round the sprawling conglomerate.
Mestrallet quickly sold crown jewels such as investment bank Banque Indosuez and fund manager Gartmore. The ailing real estate portfolio was also disposed of, leaving Suez with more than five billion francs in cash.
But he held on to a 63 percent stake in Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB) which groups some choice industrial and financial assets.
SGB welcomed Suez as a white knight in the late 1980s when it was being stalked by Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti, who saw it as ripe for takeover.
Now it looks as if SGB could be the saviour for Suez. Stock market analysts say that if there is any industrial logic in the merger, it lies in Mestrallet's focus on the utilities sector and abandoning financial services.
SGB has a 37 percent stake in Tractebel, which specialises in electricity, gas, water and environmental services. It has operations in cable television, property, infrastructure and industrial installations -- areas which overlap with Lyonnaise.
Lyonnaise, under veteran chairman Monod, has set its sights on international expansion in utilities but lacks the financial muscle to fund that growth.
A link-up would inject fresh capital from Suez's cash hoard -- even after the special dividend to sweeten Suez shareholders on the merger.
Monod said last week that a merged Suez/Lyonnaise would be a multi-service company on a global scale and capable of boosting profits and cashflow.
Monod said earlier this week, he expected Mestrallet to head the executive board of the merged company while Monod himself would head the supervisory board and handle strategy. ($ = 5.797 French Francs)

"
PierreTran,"France's Lyonnaise des Eaux and holding company Cie de Suez agreed on Friday to merge, creating a new global utilities heavyweight, and announced a series of financial goals.
As part of the deal creating a group with annual sales of more than 200 billion francs ($34.5 billion) and market capitalisation of 75 billion francs, Suez said it would pay its shareholders a dividend sweetener worth three times last year's payout.
The companies said in a joint statement they expected 1997 net profits of at least 3.50 billion francs and aimed to double earnings per share in five years after 1997.
""Beyond this year, the goal is to double net earnings per share in five years,"" they said. Shareholders of the new group will benefit from an immediate positive effect on net earnings of eight percent on the 1997 results.
The statement came after the Suez and Lyonnaise supervisory boards met to approve merger terms for the group that will be known as Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Suez said shareholders would be asked to approve the merger terms at a meeting on June 11 and authorise a dividend of 24.60 francs a share -- representing a total payout of 3.8 billion francs. It paid a dividend of 8.20 francs for 1995.
Under the agreement, Suez shareholders will get 20 Lyonnaise shares for 41 Suez shares. Trading in the two companies' shares was suspended on the Paris bourse on Friday.
The merger agreement ends the independence of Suez, set up in the 19th century to build the Suez Canal, a glory of French engineering.
Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio earlier on Friday that the larger group would absorb Suez, whose activities involve financial services and utilities, through a friendly ""merger-takeover.""
Lyonnaise's ""mission is to conquer the world,"" said Monod.
The group will focus on four core businesses -- energy, water distribution, waste management and communications -- and would give shareholders ""a very big world actor that will be a leader in its activities and enjoy high visibility,"" Monod said.
It would have the resources to invest around 17 billion francs from its first year of operation, he said. He has promised that the merged group will boost profits and cashflow.
Lyonnaise, whose activities span water distribution, construction and communications, has been pushing the deal as an operation that will give it extra muscle to expand abroad.
Lyonnaise is twice the size of Suez in terms of shareholder funds and one third bigger in share capitalisation.
Suez, once one of France's grandest corporate institutions that grew through acquisitions, fell victim in the early 1990s to a property slump.
Disgruntled Suez shareholders forced out the previous chairman Gerard Worms after the group made a four billion franc loss in 1995 and installed Gerard Mestrallet to turn round the overly diversified colossus.
Mestrallet swiftly sold crown jewels such as investment bank Banque Indosuez and fund manager Gartmore. He also disposed of the ailing real estate portfolio, leaving Suez with more than five billion francs in cash.
But he held on to a 63-percent stake in Belgian holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique, which groups some choice industrial and financial assets. ($ = 5.789 French Francs)
"
PierreTran,"Holding company Cie de Suez  and utility Lyonnaise des Eaux must tell shareholders how they will benefit from the groups' planned merger, otherwise the deal will look like a defensive move, analysts said on Friday.
The boards of Suez and Lyonnaise are expected to approve later on Friday terms of the merger which will create a group with annual sales of about 200 billion francs ($35 billion) and a market capitalisation of 75 billion.
But size is not necessarily a bonus if the new group cannot bring operating companies together and if Suez is not allowed to sell Belgian financial assets to shed its conglomerate status and focus on utilities.
""If there is no link-up between Lyonnaise and Suez, the merger makes little sense. It looks like a defensive move,"" a share analyst said.
Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio on Friday that the new group would have four core businesses -- energy, water distribution, waste management and communications.
""What do shareholders stand to gain?"" a second analyst asked. ""There is still uncertainty,"" he added.
In the short term, Suez shareholders can look forward to  a big cash payout as part of the merger terms, with a dividend estimated at around 24 francs per share, or a total of some 3.8 billion francs.
They are also getting a chance to cut the discount on Suez shares compared with underlying assets -- if the new group buries Suez's holding company image by selling financial assets to concentrate on utilities, as promised.
Suez investors will also gain by getting shares in Lyonnaise, which for all its past weakness, is one of France's biggest companies and harbours big expansion ambitions.
But Suez holders still need to be convinced on big issues related to the merger.
The merger is being structured as a Lyonnaise takeover of Suez, apparently to take advantage of Suez's tax loss carry-forward, which would shelter future profits of the new group. ""This needs to be clarified,"" said an analyst.
For Lyonnaise shareholders, the deal looks more risky.
They do not know if Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet has made guarantees of management freedom to the Belgian government for the Societe Generale de Belgique holding company, which groups choice industrial and financial assets.
Any commitments may inhibit SGB's disposal of Belgian financial assets, which include stakes in banking giant Generale de Banque and insurer Fortis.
French investment in Belgium has become a sensitive issue since Renault SA's decision to close its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels at heavy cost to jobs.
The Belgian authorities insist on keeping the Tractebel utilities company, 50.3 percent owned by SGB, independent and headquartered in Belgium. This may limit the scope for integrating Tractebel into Lyonnaise's global ambitions.
Howver, Tractebel could benefit from asset transfers from Lyonnaise, such as the Elyo energy subsidiary.
The disposal of Suez's French financial units such as consumer credit house Sofinco, property broker Banque Monod and insurer Henin Vie, pose less of a problem.
Credit Agricole, which last year bought Banque Indosuez, has an option to buy 20 percent of Sofinco next year.
Lyonnaise shareholders stand to gain an injection of fresh capital which the company needs to finance its global aspirations. But if the Suez disposals do not go according to plan, they will be left with a conglomerate on their hands, with the accompanying discount on the shares. ($ = 5.789 French Francs)

PierreTran,"A debt deal to refinance Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA /Plc may help management and bank lenders but leaves little value for the long-suffering shareholders, debt specialists said on Thursday.
Eurotunnel said on Thursday it would send prospectuses to shareholders next month giving details of a restructuring of its 70 billion francs ($12 billion) of bank debt and hoped to get approvals at a meeting in Paris by July 10.
It earlier announced a 1996 net loss of 6.1 billion francs, one billion francs less than a year ago.
One debt specialist said Eurotunnel technically has no shareholder value as its debts wiped out its ""enterprise value.""
Eurotunnel currently has issued shareholders capital of some 10 billion pounds, which it plans to halve to take into account its past losses. But the debt stock will remain intact, except for one billion pounds which will be swapped for shares.
A second debt expert said the complex debt deal takes none of the debt away but pushed out payments further into the future, giving time for management to stabilise the company.
""The restructuring works in that it solves the banks' problems by turning current debt into future potential paid debt,"" he said. ""It solves the company's problem as it allows management to continue without defaulting,"" he added.
But the problem for shareholders is the deal ""mops up all the free cashflow for the short, medium and long-term,"" he said. There is no debt write-off and the loans will be simply restructured, using instruments which extend maturities, allow extra borrowing and rolling up interest payments. However, interest margins will be lowered.
""The restructuring may leave shareholders with 50 percent of the company but 50 percent of nothing is still nothing,"" he said. ""Based on common-sense projections, it is hard to see how the equity holders are going to get anything,"" he said.
The debt/equity swap will leave equity holders with 55 percent of Eurotunnel's capital.
But first Eurotunnel must get approvals from both its 225-strong bank loan syndicate and shareholders.
Christian Cambier, chairman of the Eurotunnel shareholders association, said he has four conditions for approving the deal and would be seeking shareholder proxies to get a 34 percent blocking vote at the July meeting.
The conditions are: he wants the banks to approve the restructuring deal before the shareholders give their approval, both tunnel bores to be operating by May 15, freight service on the Shuttle to be resumed before June 15 and an extension of the tunnel concession by the French and British governments.
""I am confident we will refuse approval if the conditions are not met,"" he said. Cambier's association held proxies for 32 percent of the shareholder votes at last year's annual shareholders' meeting.
Eurotunnel is running a reduced service following a major fire on November 18 which forced the shut-down of part of the ""south"" tunnel bore and halted the freight Shuttle operation.
Another group representing Eurotunnel small shareholders, Adacte, said in a statement it maintained its opposition to the restructuring which it said gives too much to the banks and exclusively hit the shareholders by diluting the capital.
Adacte wants to postpone the shareholders meeting until the company can show a full year of continuous commercial service.
Eurotunnel has not published its cashflow forecasts to show these will cover debt service and capital expenditure needs. Although shareholders get no rights to the cashflow, they are being asked to approve a deal which dilutes their holdings.
""Last year's shareholders meeting was a rehearsal,"" said Sophie L'Helias, a laywer who helped organise the proxy solicitation for the 1996 shareholders meeting. ""This year it is the real thing. Shareholders will have to decide what is in their best interests,"" she added.
The second of the debt specialists said a rejection of the debt accord would lead to bankruptcy, which was not attractive but could leave it to a commercial court to decide whether some of the debt should be written off. ($ = 5.790 French Francs)

PierreTran,"Talk of a merger between the Airbus European passenger plane venture and U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin was premature but the two groups do have interests which would benefit from a link up, Airbus's French partner said on Saturday.
""It's premature,"" Aerospatiale vice president for corporate communications Patrice Kreis said when asked about a report in the London Times newspaper which said Airbus Industrie and Lockheed Martin were in merger talks.
""Airbus's interests and Lockheed's interests are to merge (eventually),"" he said, in the face of a pending merger by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The merged Boeing-McDonnell group ""want not only to dominate the market but to take it over completely,"" he said.
But it was too early to talk about linking up Airbus with Lockheed as European aerospace and defence companies needed to consolidate among themselves, before tackling a transatlantic merger, he said. ""There's a lot of work to do,"" he added.
Among the key steps to be taken are current moves to changing Airbus's partnership into a limited liability company. But that should occur in the context of a rationalisation of European civil and military aviation, space and weapons systems, he said.
""Airbus on its own will not survive. Everything is linked -- civilian aircraft, military aircraft, space and weapons systems,"" he said. The creation in the United States of titans such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, which embrace all these sectors, is forcing Europe to do the same.
The European consolidation would be through changes in capital at the parent-company level rather than cooperation on specific projects favoured in the past.
Important steps are being taken in France in the restructuring, with a merger of state-owned Aerospatiale and combat-plane maker Dassault Aviation, and the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF, both due to be realised this year.
Aerospatiale's chairman Yves Michot has said he was talking to Lockheed to collaborate with Airbus on specific projects.
Lockheed could become a partner in the crucial Airbus project to build a 555-seater plane, the A3XX, to rival Boeing's monopoly of the large capacity segment with its 747 jumbo.
Aerospatiale had no comment on the timing of any Lockheed decision to join the A3XX project, which has already signed up Italy's Alenia, part of the Finmecanicca group, and Saab of Sweden as potential risk-sharing partners.
Lockheed Martin and Aerospatiale both have interests in civil and military aircraft -- Lockheed makes fuselages for Boeing passenger planes, makes large military transports, and is also a prime contractor for the U.S. new-generation F22 fighter.
Aerospatiale makes Airbus cockpit systems and assembles the planes at its plant in Toulouse, southwestern France. It is also a key partner in the planned European Future Large Aircraft (FLA) military transport.
British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG and Casa of Spain are the other Airbus partners working on changing it to an integrated company by 1999.
"
PierreTran,"Partners of the Andersen Worldwide professional services business opened a key meeting on Monday to air major differences on how the $11 billion global venture should develop.
The Andersen group covers the Arthur Andersen accounting and audit practice and Andersen Consulting, which specialises in strategic advisory work.
The 2,700 partners are meeting in Paris hoping to resolve problems stemming from the rapid growth of Andersen Consulting and tensions between the two Andersen businesses.
The group posted revenues of $9.5 billion in 1996 and is tracking toward $11 billion by August 1997, an Andersen executive told Reuters recently.
But the rise of the consulting side since it set up as a separate unit in 1989 has fuelled demands for a reorganisation which reflects its wealth and importance within the group.
At stake is how the partnership votes are distributed and fee income is shared out across the Andersen group.
Revenues at the consulting arm have grown between 20-25 percent a year, while the traditional accountancy practice has shown annual growth of 11-13 percent.
The 1996 revenues were split $4.9 billion for consulting and $4.6 billion for accountancy. That was the first time consulting revenues outstripped the accounting side, the executive said. The earnings differential is widening, with consulting expected to bring in $6 billion and accountants $5 billion in 1997.
But there are around 1,650 audit and 1,100 consulting partners, so not only do fewer consulting partners make more money than their accounting colleagues, they have a smaller share of the partners' votes.
Also, under a complex system of worldwide allocation of revenues, the consultants end up effectively transferring wealth to the accountants.
The Paris meeting will air the issues, such as keeping more of the consulting income on that side of the group, the executive said.
""We are not in a crisis,"" the Andersen executive said. ""Revenues and earnings continue to grow year on year."" But there is room for a change in governance, he added.
Among the various options which have been studied are a separation of the two businesses but that radical move was not considered likely. ""I don't think that's most likely,"" he said.
A more gradualist approach might be to streamline the decision-making process. Any proposals which require ""constitutional change"" would require a two-thirds majority of partners in Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting.
Andersen Consulting owes its success to demand from blue-chip firms for management advice, computer-related services and the trend in contracting out administrative jobs traditionally done in-house. Its international corporate identity reflects the global nature of its clients' businesses.
Consulting's rivals includes computer specialists International Business Machines , EDS as well as high-powered management consultants such as McKinsey.
The Arthur Andersen accountancy, set up in Chicago in 1913, is one of the so-called Big Six practices. It draws on a customer base of mid-sized firms, and member firms have a strong national identity in the 79 countries in which it has offices.
The Paris meeting, part of an 18-month cycle of partners' gatherings, will be the last with Lawrence Weinbach as managing partner and chief executive, as he is stepping down in August.
"
PierreTran,"The restructuring of France's defence sector and the key role of state-owned Aerospatiale in the process are complicating moves by the European Airbus consortium to become a limited liability company, analysts say.
The four national firms in Airbus Industrie are studying the best way to convert the partnership into a faster, more efficient company able to compete with U.S. rival Boeing Co, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas Corp.
Aerospatiale, the French partner in the Airbus passenger plane venture, is also involved in two deals at the heart of France's defence industry consolidation -- the merger of Aerospatiale and combat plane-maker Dassault Aviation and the privatisation of electronics firm Thomson-CSF.
""It is consistent with French strategic thinking that you must first get your house in order, then negotiate from a position of strength,"" said an industry executive.
""Aerospatiale cannot do this today in the Airbus system. It has to have weight behind it. It will have that weight when the Dassault merger is complete,"" he added.
DASSAULT MERGER WILL BOOST AEROSPATIALE
The Dassault merger, due to be agreed this year, will add 13 billion francs ($2.2 billion) of annual turnover to Aerospatiale, creating a group with combined sales of 64 billion and giving Aerospatiale greater clout at the Airbus negotiating table.
A banker close to the Airbus talks said Aerospatiale is seen as the weakest of the senior Airbus partners -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Casa of Spain makes up the fourth Airbus partner.
But Aerospatiale will get an injection of aggressive, private-sector management with the Dassault merger.
Aerospatiale executives complain bitterly that the foreign media does not give them due credit for their industrial restructuring which turned the company round to post a 1996 net attributable profit of 812 million francs, after years of losses, and recorded sales of 51 billion francs.
Their exasperation is palpable when they say their public sector tag is seen as a weakness when compared to the private sector BAe and Dasa.
But analysts point out that Aerospatiale was slower in attacking its cost structure and still needs to improve.
BAe underwent drastic pruning in the early 1990s, going from an empire with property, cars and military interests to a group focused on defence and aerospace. It posted 1996 pretax profits of 425 million pounds ($690.3 million), on sales of 7.44 billion pounds.
Dasa, although loss-making, has the industrial and financial strength of parent Daimler-Benz AG which has set a management target of a 12 percent return on capital. Dasa posted 1996 turnover of 13 billion marks ($7.6 billion), making it smaller than BAe and Aerospatiale, but it has huge ambitions for Airbus.
A business consultant said Aerospatiale had excellent programmes, but its military projects were 30 percent more costly than those of BAe and Dasa.
THOMSON-CSF SALE ENHANCES PROSPECTS
Apart from the Dassault merger, Aerospatiale also holds a key hand in the Thomson-CSF sell-off.
The government has said bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere will have to take into account Aerospatiale's interests when putting together their offers for Thomson-CSF.
Even though Aerospatiale, as a state-controlled company, cannot take part directly in the privatisation, it will be affected by the outcome and chairman Yves Michot will give his views to the government on the rival bids.
French newspapers have reported that Michot will have to observe strict neutrality in the contest. But it is clear Alcatel's plans would significantly strengthen Aerospatiale, giving it more weight against BAe and Dasa.
If Alcatel won Thomson-CSF, it would create a missiles joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, and a satellite venture between Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF.
Lagardere has said it wants a dialogue with Aerospatiale to prepare its bid. Relations between the two firms have been strained as they compete in missiles and satellites.
""The perimeter of Aerospatiale is not yet defined,"" said the industry executive.
The government plans to decide on the Thomson-CSF bids by June 30.
AEROSPATIALE NEEDS AIRBUS, WILL MAKE IT WORK
Aerospatiale stands to gain from the defence moves and is in no hurry to bow to pressures from BAe and Dasa to rush into an Airbus agreement which does not suit its own interests.
However, Airbus is vitally important for Aerospatiale. Its 38 percent stake in Airbus contributed the biggest slice of 1996 operating profit, 1.175 billion francs, and around 70 percent of sales.
Analysts believe that of the Airbus big three, Aerospatiale needs Airbus the most, and that BAe and Dasa could walk away if relations broke down irreparably.
BAe has a 20 percent Airbus stake and has bigger military interests, while Dasa's parent Daimler-Benz gets most of its money from the auto business, through Mercedes trucks and cars.
Aerospatiale has, paradoxically, maximalist and minimalist aims for the new Airbus company.
For the short term, Michot argues that the present arrangement with Airbus has proved its worth, winning a third of the world market. A much bigger manufacturing concern could overstretch the management, it reasons.
In the long term however, Michot would like Airbus to have a military wing, to balance out economic cycles with government contracts.
The Airbus partners said in January they agreed in principle on the change to a single integrated company, in which the new Airbus would own its factories and design offices. Work is going on this year on valuing the assets to be vested in the new firm.
That valuation is complicated as some of the factories mix civil and military programmes, and some plants are efficient while others are uncompetitive.
One way of viewing the Airbus negotiations is through the prism of conflicting cultural visions.
""This country (France) has a vision of long-term industrial strategy. It wants to be a world power and be a dominant player in the aircraft industry,"" said the industry executive. Without that vision, Airbus arguably would never have got funds to launch its first plane in the early 1970s.
Set against that long-term strategic view, is the British insistence on short-term returns for shareholders, summed up as ""Let the City decide"". ($ = 5.790 French Francs) ($ = 0.615 British Pounds) ($ = 1.716 German Marks)

PierreTran,"U.S. aero-engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney marked on Wednesday a revamp of global operations with the opening of a regional office in Paris to anchor a new market strategy aimed at getting closer to civil and military clients.
The office at the La Defense business district on the Paris outskirts will spearhead P&amp;W's efforts to sell the ""total thrust management"" concept to airlines and air forces in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Robert Wolfe, president of large commercial engines told reporters.
P&amp;W, a unit of the United Technologies Corp industrial group, aims to ""integrate closely with its customers"" through the regional offices which serve the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, he said.
P&amp;W makes engines for passenger planes with thrust ranging from 17,000 to 98,000 pounds, as well as combat jets such as the F15 and F16 fighters and the futuristic F22 stealth warplane.
Wolfe said P&amp;W has a 53 percent share of all engines sold on the Airbus Industrie A330 wide-body plane and 41 percent of the Boeing 777 giant twinjet.
The Hartford, Connecticut-based firm wants to expand market share by handling ""all aspects of the propulsion system with the airline, to become the thrust manager"" for the life of the engines, instead of just selling or leasing power plants.
That package deal would include setting up a special purpose company to buy engines and lease them to the airline. It would take charge of overhaul, repairs and maintenance -- leaving airlines to concentrate on flying passengers, Wolfe said.
The engine overhaul business is forecast to generate $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion by the end of next year, contributing about 30 percent of P&amp;W's total revenues, he said.
It is discussing the thrust management concept with airlines British Airways Plc, Swissair and Singapore Airlines, and wants to be the first to sign contracts in this area, Wolfe said.
It has already signed contracts with Delta for engine inventory management and Airbus for all engine maintenance on aircraft owned or leased by the European consortium.
Major U.S. airlines including Delta and United Airlines are also interested. ""We think we have broken the ground for the first step toward full-thrust management,"" he said.
P&amp;W is looking at acquisitions and joint ventures among smaller firms specialising in overhaul to help boost operations. ""I dare say you could see some of those occurring in the coming months,"" he said.
P&amp;W currently has around 15 percent of the total sales in the overhaul business in both commercial and military engines but expects to increase that ""easily"" to 30 percent, he said, giving no timetable.
The U.S. military is considering privatising maintenance of its park of F100 engines for the F15 and F16 aircraft, he said. And supply contracts for the F22's F119 engine stipulate the maintenance will come from P&amp;W.
Airlines stood to gain savings of 20-25 percent over the life of the engines, including the acquisition cost, while P&amp;W would be able to predict confidently the costs and margins of its products over the total life cycle.
Wolfe declined to give the margins on current business.
Industry executives have said competition for engine sales forces the leaders, P&amp;W, General Electric and Rolls-Royce Plc to sell their products on razor-thin margins, if any at all, and recoup their money on sales of spares over the 25-or-so year life of the plant.
P&amp;W expects 14,000 commercial jets to be sold in the next 20 years, with the world aviation market growing five percent a year. Europe will grow annually 3.9 percent, and in terms of revenue per passenger mile, ranks as the third largest regional market with 25 percent of the world total.

PierreTran,"Rival bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere Group are expected to put in final offers on Wednesday to meet the government's timetable in the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF.
A source close to telecommunications giant Alcatel said on Monday the final offer would confirm the terms of its joint bid with privately-held Dassault Industries.
Alcatel has held talks with Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) over cooperation if it won Thomson-CSF but these were ""not binding on the French government,"" the source said. Dasa has said it is talking to Alcatel and Lagardere.
But the larger issue is what deals the British heavyweight defence firm General Electric Company Plc (GEC) has discussed with the two French contenders, the source said.
Dasa, while ambitious for a bigger role in European defence, is smaller than GEC, which is Britain's largest defence electronics group and a major rival to Alcatel in world markets.
Alcatel has to be more careful in negotiating with GEC, the source said.
Although the French government ruled out GEC as a candidate in the Thomson-CSF sale, saying it went against national security interests to sell more than 50 percent of the firm to a foreign company, it encouraged Lagardere and Alcatel to talk to GEC in preparing their bids.
Analysts believe GEC knew it would not be allowed to make its own bid but used the opportunity to serve notice that it wants a share of the business plan with whoever wins.
The government's sale terms and conditions are centred on creating a strong group around Thomson-CSF with the widest possible industrial participation and with a European dimension.
""The prospects for restructuring the defence industry in a European context will be taken into account by the government. The two candidates know that,"" Industry Minister Franck Borotra told reporters on Monday.
""Alcatel won't do it at any cost,"" the source close to Alcatel said. While the Thomson-CSF deal is important to developing Alcatel's business, chairman Serge Tchuruk does not want it so badly as to make ""dangerous concessions"".
A source close to Lagardere said neither Lagardere nor Alcatel would bid for Thomson-CSF at any price.
Lagardere has close ties with both GEC and British Aerospace Plc (BAe). It has a satellite joint venture with GEC through Matra Marconi Space and a missile venture with BAe in Matra-BAe Dynamics.
Alcatel is partners with GEC in GEC Alsthom, the power engineering joint venture.
The government has said it would hold to the timetable on the Thomson-CSF sale despite a pending parliamentary election which pushed back the partial privatisation of France Telecom by a month. The state expects to choose the buyer of Thomson-CSF by June 30.
Socialist leader Lionel Jospin, campaigning against the RPR/UDF centre-right coalition, said on April 22 he opposed further privatisations, saying ""if Thomson is to be sold for one franc, honestly that is not what we want to do.""
The government was forced into privatising Thomson-CSF separately from the Thomson SA electronics group when the independent Privatisation Commission threw out last year the government's preferred bid by Lagardere.
Lagardere wanted to buy the whole group for one franc and re-sell the loss-making consumer goods arm Thomson Multimedia for a symbolic one franc to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
"
PierreTran,"French engineering group Alcatel Alsthom and missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere said on Wednesday they had submitted firm and final offers for Thomson-CSF.
British Aerospace Plc said in London it was putting 300 million pound stg in Lagardere's offer while GEC Plc said it had signed memoranda of understanding with both bidders.
The state is selling its 58 percent stake in defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF and had set a midday deadline for the bidders to make their industrial and financial proposals.
The French government, mindful of a threat from U.S. defence mega-mergers and the need to build a national champion before embarking on European consolidation, set sale terms seeking the biggest possible industrial participation around Thomson-CSF.
The government is not expected to take any decision until after the two-round parliamentary election of May 25 and June 1.
Alcatel and family-owned Dassault Industries said they had submitted a joint bid for Thomson-CSF and hoped aerospace group Aerospatiale would join them afterwards if they won.
Alcatel and Dassault, which holds a majority stake in warplane maker Dassault Aviation, said they were committed to increasing Thomson-CSF's size ""by close to 50 percent to create a world leader in defence electronics as well as in the associated civil sectors"".
Dassault is offering to put its Dassault Electronique subsidiary into a joint venture with Thomson-CSF, which would bring significant assets in guidance systems, aircraft and missile electronics to Thomson-CSF.
If Aerospatiale does join up with Thomson-CSF through the Alcatel-Dassault bid, that holds out the possibility of further industrial integration as Aerospatiale is merging with Dassault Aviation, another move vital to the French consolidation.
Alcatel and Dassault said they could finance the acquisition from their own resources without compromising the future or using the resources of Thomson-CSF.
If the joint bid succeeded, it would form a 25-billion franc annual pool for research and development, with major benefits in civil and miltary syngeries, the two companies said.
Lagardere said it had the finances needed to fund the acquisition and an eventual offer to buy out minority shareholders in Thomson-CSF. It would issue a special five billion franc bond convertible into Thomson-CSF shares to help fund the deal, along with its own cash and credit lines.
The bond would be a one-year, eurofranc issue  underwritten by Credit Lyonnais and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. It would be repaid in cash and Thomson-CSF shares depending on terms of a planned merger between Thomson-CSF and Matra High Technologies and the public offer to minorities.
Lagardere had been the government's favoured bidder for the whole Thomson SA group last year but the independent Privatisation Commission rejected its offer, which included selling the loss-making Thomson Multimedia unit for one franc to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea.
Lagardere's Matra space and missiles businesses have British alliances with British Aerospace Plc and GEC Plc.
The Thomson-CSF sale is being closely watched as France is the last of the four major European arms producers to shake up its industry, a step needed to open the way for new cross-border alliances with partners in Britain, Germany and Italy.
In London, Britain's GEC said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with both candidates bidding for Thomson-CSF. It said it would enter talks to combine some of the business of its GEC-Marconi division with those of Thomson-CSF.
Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) has also said it has held talks with the French bidders aimed at possible cooperation.
Thomson-CSF makes military radios, radars, sonars, aircraft, naval and missile electronics, and training simulators. It made a 1996 net attributable profit of 745 million francs on sales of 36.3 billion francs.
"
PierreTran,"A bid by conglomerate Lagardere for military electronics firm Thomson-CSF highlights the cutthroat competition in the secretive world of naval combat systems, a senior defence source said on Monday.
Publishing-to-missiles group Lagardere and engineering company Alcatel Alsthom filed rival offers last Wednesday in the Thomson-CSF privatisation, seen as a big step in the consolidation of the European defence industry.
Lagardere said it had secured 300 million pounds ($500 million) in financing from defence giant British Aerospace Plc and would put BAe's and Thomson-CSF's naval businesses into Matra BAe Dynamics, a joint venture held by Lagardere and BAe.
France and Britain, countries which have strong maritime traditions, have waged a commercial war in naval systems, sometimes in alliance, but more often squared off as rivals.
""I believe we have a real lead in the field of naval combat systems that the British do not have,"" said the defence official. ""It's a crown jewel. I would be amazed if we gave this away.""
Thomson-CSF and rivals such as BAe and General Electric Co Plc design and integrate the complex electronic and computer systems controlling weapons and radar for ships and submarines. The submarine sector, based on sonar technology, is considered a ""sovereignty issue"" for France, the official said.
The Alcatel camp is hoping the French government will not let Thomson's naval assets slip into foreign control by accepting Lagardere's bid and undermining the sovereignty issue.
The Thomson-CSF sale offers a rare opportunity for BAe to grab a market share built up by the French firm since 1990 when it bought Signaal of the Netherlands.
Thomson-CSF said naval systems contributed about six billion francs of 1996 turnover of Thomson-CSF's total 36 billion franc sales. Defence electronics as a whole, including aerospace and land-based systems, made up 65 percent of the group's sales.
Thomson-CSF has allied with state-owned DCN naval shipyard for combat systems for ships but the DCN jealously guards its submarine technology, heavily restricting Thomson-CSF's access to its sonar systems, the defence official said.
Sonar technology is inextricably tied to submarine architecture, the source said, adding ""The field of sonar is an area of sovereignty for the French navy.""
Two major deals in naval systems highlight their strategic importance, a source following the Thomson-CSF sell-off commented.
BAe is acquiring a 49-percent stake in German defence firm STN Atlas, as part of a consortium with arms company Rheinmetall AG and utilities firm Badenwerk.
The Anglo-German consortium won against stiff competition from U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin, Daimler-Benz Aerospace and Thomson-CSF, the source said.
BAe's BAeSema joint venture with the Sema computer systems house, is expected to play a key role in the BAe bid, despite a statement last Wednesday by BAeSema to the contrary, a senior industry source said.
A second major move in the area was creation of Thomson Marconi Sonar, a joint venture between GEC and Thomson-CSF -- which some French newspapers viewed as costing then Thomson-CSF chairman Alain Gomez his job as the government thought it brought the British too close to its strategic technology.
GEC is a huge player in the submarine field and secured a two billion pound contract in March to build three nuclear -powered Trafalgar class submarines for the British navy.
Thomson-CSF's share of key programmes include France's La Fayette ""stealth"" frigate, the Horizon warship being built by Britain, Italy and France, and through Signaal, is working on a frigate being built by Germany and the Netherlands.

PierreTran,"French carmakers Renault SA and PSA Peugeot Citroen on Wednesday reported slight gains in first-quarter sales, despite sharp falls in their core domestic market.
Renault reported consolidated revenues of 47.2 billion francs ($8.2 billion), up three percent from a year ago or 1.8 percent on a like-for-like basis.
The PSA group posted turnover of 43.51 billion francs, up 0.9 percent or 0.6 percent on a like-for-like basis.
Both firms said exports offset sharp drops in domestic sales following the end to a French government rebate scheme to encourage car purchases. Renault's sales in the home market dropped 26.5 percent in the period, while PSA's fell 30 percent.
""In the first quarter, the upturn in the automobile market in western Europe, excluding France, was slightly higher than expected. In addition, there was a favourable trend in exchange rates,"" Renault said in a statement.
Renault's automobile division revenues were up 4.7 percent, or 2.7 percent on a like-for-like basis. This sector accounts for 80 percent of total group revenues.
Commercial vehicles, which includes Mack Trucks in the United States, saw a 2.7 percent revenue decline to 7.36 billion francs. Stripping out changes in company structure and currency movements, the fall was 0.9 percent, which was mainly due to a drop in European sales.
Renault's finance division contributed two billion francs, representing 4.2 percent of group revenues, down from 4.7 percent, with the fall due to lower interest rates in France and Germany.
The French government holds a 46 percent stake in Renault, which is currently embroiled in a controversial closure of its Vilvoorde car plant in Belgium.
The PSA group recorded total worldwide sales of 498,200 vehicles, up 0.7 percent from the 1996 period. The automobile division showed a 0.9 percent rise, or 0.6 percent on a like-for-like basis.
Sales of its Peugeot and Citroen cars in western Europe fell 9.8 percent to 381,000 in the first quarter, due to a fall in the French market following the end of the rebate system, PSA said in a statement.
PSA saw sales in the European market, outside France, rise 4.6 percent to 270,100 units, with particularly good performances in Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.
A launch of the Citroen Berlingo and Peugeot Partner products helped boost sales of light utility vehicles in the European market by 30 percent to 67,500 units. ($ = 5.742 French Francs)

RobinSidel,"When ITT broke into three companies in 1995, top executives said the move would increase value for stockholders, fuel growth and make the separate businesses more competitive.
But independence has come at a high price for the former conglomerate's hotel, casino and entertainment division known as ITT Corp. Industry competition is fiercer than ever before, a huge expansion plan has been unexpectedly difficult, and the company's stock price has eroded dramatically in the past few months.  
And now, rival Hilton Hotels Corp is prepared to launch a $6.5 billion hostile takeover of the company whose assets include some of the world's best-known properties - from the New York Knicks to Sheraton hotels to Madison Square Garden.
""ITT has always bought the highest-quality assets. When they go out and buy something, they always buy the best and they've always paid a lot of money for those assets - maybe too much - but the bottom line is they own some top quality assets,"" said Bruce Raabe of Collins &amp; Co.  
It is the appeal of those assets and the view that they should be contributing more to the company's bottom line that may make ITT vulnerable, industry experts said.
So far, ITT has said little about the Hilton offer other than it will consider it. A source familiar with ITT said its board has a regularly scheduled meeting next Tuesday.
An ITT spokesman could not be reached for comment.
But industry analysts widely believe the $55 cash and stock offer made by Hilton undervalues the company. Shares of ITT soared 14-1/4 to 56-7/8 on views that any transaction will come at a higher price than the Monday offer.  
Wall Street sources knowledgeable about ITT's operations admit the giant company has faltered in recent months even as it has pursued an aggressive path of expansion. The company, which has earmarked $2.5 billion for expansion, lost out to Hilton in a bid for Bally Entertainment Corp and has suffered construction project setbacks and losses from its high-stakes bacarrat tables in Las Vegas.
""Remember, this company has only been public for a year. The company gets a lot of attention and it doesn't shrink from doing aggressive things,"" said one Wall Street source who did not want to be identified.  
But others said the company's acquisition strategy is not well focused, the construction problems were avoidable and the company's management does not have a strong background in operating casinos. Chief executive Rand Araskog ran the conglomerate since 1979 and took control of the new ITT Corp after overseeing the three-way split. President Robert Bowman is considered to be an extremely savvy financier, but does not comes from the gaming industry.
""This is a team that isn't working very well together. Araskog is the behind-the-desk kind of CEO instead of the kind of guy who's out living and breathing his business. Bowman is working with intellect and energy, but without a good perspective of the business,"" said one industry expert who did not want to be identified.
ITT, which is expected to rebuff the takeover effort, is likely to tout its future plans as an enticement for shareholders.
""The less-than-favorable publicity, some of which has been unfair, that the officers of ITT have received, has overshadowed the fact that management is looking at long-term plans, but fast management is now more respected than long-term planning,"" said Bjorn Hanson, hospitality industry chairman at Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
"
RobinSidel,"Chief executives of Conrail Inc., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. are expected to hold a crucial meeting this week that could help put a giant railroad merger back on track.
Although final details still had not been set by late Monday, sources familiar with the plans said the meeting of the three executives was likely to occur by the end of the week.
""They are working on a date to meet in the next few days,"" said one source close to the railroads who did not want to be identified.
Conrail's David LeVan, CSX's John Snow and David Goode of Norfolk Southern last week agreed to hold discussions about the planned $9.5 billion merger of Conrail and CSX.
First announced in October, the planned transaction has been fraught with troubles due to a rival $10.3 billion bid from Norfolk Southern. Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer, contending that the CSX deal was a better fit.
Earlier this month, however, Conrail shareholders rejected a key measure needed for the CSX transaction to move forward.
Sources said that attorneys for the three railroads over the weekend hammered out terms of draft confidentiality pacts.
Only LeVan, Snow and Goode are expected to participate in the meeting.
Two other sources familiar with the companies' plans said the three railroads may announce as soon as Tuesday that a meeting has been scheduled, but likely will not provide any Like most industry experts, the sources involved in the transaction warned that any agreement between the three railroads will not be quick.
""I don't think this is an easy thing to resolve. It's a long way from saying this is a done deal,"" said one.
""I think everyone agrees its resolveable, but certainly the parties are starting out far apart,"" said another.
Some Wall Street experts have speculated that the ultimate conclusion will call for a splitting up of Conrail's assets.
But one of the sources close to Conrail stressed that LeVan still opposes carving up the railroad and distributing the pieces to Richmond, Va.-based CSX and Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern.
Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern executives will be in New York on Wednesday for a quarterly meeting with Wall Street analysts.
"
RobinSidel,"ITT Corp is expected to battle an unsolicited bid from Hilton Hotels Corp with an arsenal of defenses that include its well-known franchise name, its ""poison pill"" anti-takeover plan and the promise of future earnings power.
Wall Street takeover experts said the 29 percent premium offered by Hilton in its $6.5 billion offer for ITT is not enough to win the company.
""The franchise value alone is worth more than what they're offering,"" said one trader who did not want to be identified.  
Hilton earlier announced the cash and stock offer for ITT and kept open the possibility of a higher offer if it is permitted to look at ITT's financial data.
ITT could not be reached for comment.
Owner of properties such as Madison Square Garden, Caesar's World and the New York Knicks professional basketball team, ITT's stock price has been hurt recently by gaming construction disruptions and competition. Shares of ITT, which were trading at about 65 in June, closed Monday at 42-5/8.
But traders expect the stock price to rebound as a $2.5 billion capital expenditure program starts to pay off.  
""It's a company with a potentially very high value. Right now, the deck is stacked in favor of the target,"" said Eric Longmire of Wyser-Pratte &amp; Co Inc.
ITT is gambling much of its future on the $2.5 billion capital spending program, which will expand and update its casino operations. It opened the Las Vegas Desert Inn resort last month after a $160 million renovation.
In December, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded its outlook on the company to negative from stable, saying that the capital spending plan would result in higher debt.  
""Since the break-up, they've been on an expansion binge. The excitement of the break-up is over and now the company has to perform,"" said the takeover trader.
Last week, chief operating offer Robert Bowman told Reuters in an interview that ITT may pursue hotel acquisitions this year. The company reportedly last year sought to buy Bally Entertainment Corp, but the hotel company eventually was sold to Hilton for $3 billion.
It also is expected this year to sell its $550 million stake in French telecommunications firm Alcatel Alsthom.
ITT was part of a huge conglomerate until 1995, when it spun off its manufacturing operations as ITT Industries and its insurance division as ITT Hartford Group Inc.
ITT Corp chief executive officer Rand Araskog has run the company since 1979 and took over as top executive of the entertainment and gaming company after the spin-off.
"
RobinSidel,"The top executive of Norfolk Southern Corp admitted talks aimed at resolving a stalemate over the future of Conrail Inc will be difficult but said he remains optimistic about the outcome.
""I go prepared, on my own part, to negotiate hard, to negotiate fairly and to negotiate to reach a reasonable solution.  I am confident others will do the same,"" chief executive officer David Goode told reporters at a press conference after a meeting with Wall Street analysts.  
A $9.5 billion planned merger between Conrail and CSX Corp has been fraught with problems due to a rival $10.3 billion bid from Norfolk Southern.  Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer, saying the CSX deal is a better fit.
Conrail shareholders earlier this month defeated a key provision that would have permitted the planned merger to move forward.  At the same time, Norfolk Southern is in the process of buying 9.9 percent of Conrail's stock.
Speaking in a raspy voice, Goode said he would meet with Conrail and CSX on Friday.  
Goode was extremely tight-lipped about details of the meeting, declining to disclose the location or who would attend.  He also said it was premature to discuss a timetable for the possible resolution of the stalemate.
However, sources close to the companies earlier this week said that only Goode, Conrail chief executive David LeVan and CSX chief executive John Snow were expected to attend.
Goode reiterated that Norfolk Southern would not accept any type of settlement that values Conrail at less than its offer of $115 per share, but added ""I'm going in with a completely open mind.""  
Indications that negotiations were forthcoming developed last week when Goode offered to sit down with LeVan and Snow. The two executives quickly responded in a letter saying that they would be willing to meet.
Although he initially spoke only with Snow by telephone, Goode said at the press conference that he has since spoken with LeVan.  He did not discuss the nature of the conversation.
The meeting with analysts focused on Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter results, issued Wednesday, but most of the questions coming from the audience dealt with Conrail.
Conrail and CSX could not immediately be reached to comment on the meeting or to confirm that their executives would attend.
"
RobinSidel,"ITT Corp. met with financial advisers on Thursday to assess an unsolicited $6.5 billion bid from Hilton Hotels Corp., while some Wall Street analysts said the company's best defence might be to pursue an acquisition.
Industry experts said ITT might be able to stave off the takeover if it made a large casino or hotel purchase.
""ITT is a company with a lot of friends on Wall Street and a lot of investment bankers and there are a lot of players in the gaming industry who would like to trade up to a higher quality,"" said Thomas Ryan of Bankers Trust.
Although ITT is widely expected to reject the offer, sources close to the company said no decision had been made and no acquisition talks were being held. ITT's board will consider the bid at a regularly-scheduled board meeting next Tuesday.
ITT declined to comment.
On Monday, Hilton offered to buy ITT in a stock and cash transaction that values the company at $55 per share. The offer also includes the assumption of $4 billion in debt.
The stock of New York-based ITT, which soared most of the week on views Hilton would be forced to raise the bid, fell 75 cents to $56.875.
On Friday, ITT's financial advisers are expected to pore over Hilton's official bid documents that are to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
An acquisition ""certainly would be in keeping with the company's history. (ITT Chairman Rand Araskog) has either got to be a buyer or he's got to let the company go,"" said Gerry Shapiro, managing director at KPMG Peat Marwick.
Industry experts said a sizable acquisition by ITT would thwart Hilton's takeover plan by making the purchase price too costly. In a telephone conference call with reporters earlier this week, Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach vowed the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based company would only pursue transactions that added to earnings.
Industry experts speculated that one of the most attractive acquisition candidates would be Harrah's Entertainment Inc. which has long been considered ripe to participate in industry consolidation.
A spokesman for Harrah's declined to comment.
An acquisition would also further solidify Araskog's role at the company he has run since 1979. He ran the ITT conglomerate and then took over the hotel, entertainment and gambling portion of the company when it split into three pieces in 1995.
""I think Rand Araskog doesn't want to give up his job.,"" said Forum Capital Markets analyst Philip Platek, who also speculated that ITT could buy a gambling or lodging company.

RobinSidel,"The chairman of French holding company CGIP said Thursday he wants to sell a 20 percent stake in information technology company Cap Gemini and would consider several options for the proceeds of the potential sale, including a share buyback.
""We have known that we would not be a shareholder for the future. It is time for us to pass the baton,"" Ernest-Antoine Seilliere told Reuters in an interview.
CGIP has indicated a willingness to sell to Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, which holds 24.4 percent of Cap Gemini.  
Seilliere said CGIP has not held any discussions with the German company about the potential sale, but would be willing to entertain other offers if Daimler-Benz does not make a decision on its strategy.
CGIP has held the stake for 15 years.
""We cannot stay forever in this situation, but for the time being, it is wait-and-see. There is a limited time this can go on,"" he said, but declined to identify a timetable.
In November, CGIP sold four percent of its investment in Cap Gemini.  
Discussing the reasons that the holding company wants to sell the Cap Gemini stake, Seilliere noted CGIP's criteria to retain a strong role in its investments.
""We are not the powerful shareholder that can dedicate all its means to the company,"" he said.
CGIP would weigh several options for proceeds, including a share buyback, Seilliere said, adding the stock is trading at a discount despite a 51 percent jump since October.
The company would also consider expanding its 33 percent investment in private biological diagnostic firm BioMerieux Alliance.  
""It's a niche in the diagnostic world. It's a field where you can converge all sorts of information technology,"" he said.
Other considerations include building its current involvement in abrasive pellet firm  Wheelabrator-Allevard or quality control company  Bureau Veritas, he said.
Earnings for 1996, which are slated to be issued in early April, are expected to be strong, Seilliere said.
""They are going to be good because all the companies of the group are increasing their results,"" he said.
CGIP ended months of speculation in November when it signed a deal to acquire a 20 percent stake in French car parts maker Valeo SA from an investment company controlled by Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti.

RobinSidel,"The top executives of Conrail Inc., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. met Friday in a critical session aimed at resolving a stalemate in the three-month takeover battle for Philadelphia-based Conrail.
The three companies declined to comment on the session, but hinted that future meetings could be forthcoming.
""Conrail, CSX and Norfolk Southern have concluded their meeting and have agreed that no further details on this meeting or timing of future meetings will be announced,"" the railroads said in a joint statement.
The long-awaited meeting between chief executives David LeVan of Conrail, John Snow of CSX and David Goode of Norfolk Southern is viewed as critical to railroad consolidation on the East Coast.
Conrail has rejected a $10.3 billion cash offer from Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern in favour of a $9.6 billion cash and stock transaction with Richmond, Va.-based CSX.
The deal ran into trouble earlier this month when Conrail shareholders defeated a key provision that would have permitted the planned merger with CSX to move forward. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern is now in the process of buying 9.9 percent of Conrail's stock.
The three executives agreed last week to hold a meeting to discuss competitive issues in the railroad industry. Conrail and CSX have stressed they are committed to their transaction and Norfolk Southern has said it would not accept any resolution that would value Conrail at less than its $115 per share offer.
Wall Street analysts expressed cautious optimism about the meeting, but warned that any end to the stalemate would be difficult and lengthy. On Wednesday, Goode also said that negotiations would likely be tough.
""We would suggest it is the first of many meetings, but it's a step in the right direction,"" said Thomas Galvin of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, noting that East Coast railroad consolidation has been discussed for the past 10 years.
Separately, the head of the federal agency that oversees railroads, reiterated her support of private sector negotiations to resolve competitive access issues in railroad mergers.
""What history has shown us is that private sector negotiations do result in the benefit to the parties involved and the public at large,"" said Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, in a speech at the National Mining Association's annual transportation conference being held in Florida.
Although Morgan did not address the Conrail case specifically, she said the board would look to preserve competition in the nation's rail network.
Shares of Conrail dipped 12.5 cents to $107.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock also fell 12.5 cents to $48.50 and Norfolk Southern shares fell 50 cents to $88.625, also on NYSE.

RobinSidel,"ITT Corp. moved forward on Monday with preparations for its Tuesday board meeting at which it will consider a $6.5 billion unsolicited takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corp.
The meeting, to be held in New York, will be the first board session since Hilton launched its offer last week. The board, which has until Feb. 14 to respond to Hilton's offer, is not expected to make a decision right away.
ITT spokesman Jim Gallagher declined to disclose the time of the meeting. A source close to the company indicated that the session is likely to last most of the day.
On Saturday, ITT Chairman Rand Araskog turned down a request from Hilton's top executive to meet. Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach had asked to meet Araskog before Tuesday's board meeting or be permitted to make a presentation to the ITT board.
Araskog rejected the offer in a faxed letter to Bollenbach, saying it would be inappropriate.
The cash and stock transaction values ITT at $55 per share.
ITT stock, which rose sharply last week on views that Hilton will be forced to raise its bid, lost 25 cents to $56.875 in Monday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
As ITT was preparing for the meeting, Bollenbach flew to London on Monday to meet with Hilton's European partner. Hilton Hotels owns the rights to the Hilton brand in the United States and Ladbroke Group Plc. holds them in the rest of the world.
Hilton officials said Bollenbach, who was named to the Ladbroke board last month as part of the expanded alliance between the two companies, would attend a Ladbroke board meeting. He was due to return to the United States by mid-week.
Shares of Ladbroke traded in London rose on Monday amid speculation that ITT may bid for Ladbroke as part of its anticipated defense against a Hilton takeover. London analysts downplayed the speculation, which was fueled by a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that disclosed Ladbroke and ITT had discussed a possible joint venture or merger a year ago.
Meanwhile, Hilton said Monday that it expects soon to announce other hotel acquisitions.
""There are a lot of things on our plate. We've got things working on the hotel side,"" Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs Marc Grossman told reporters at an industry conference sponsored by Montgomery Securities. He declined to discuss details.
Separately, HFS Inc. Chairman Henry Silverman said in an interview that his company had been searching for a new hotel brand when it reached its latest agreement with Hilton. The Hilton offer for ITT includes a pact in which HFS would license ITT's Sheraton trademark, franchise system and management agreements.
Silverman said the preliminary agreement was struck with Hilton several days before it announced its offer for ITT and evolved from previous discussions between the two companies.
HFS is a consumer services company with hotel franchise, automotive and real estate holdings.

RobinSidel,"The chairman of ITT Corp has rejected an offer to meet the top executive of Hilton Hotels Corp, which last week launched a $6.5 billion hostile takeover of the hotel, casino and entertainment giant, sources close to the companies said.
In a letter faxed to Hilton chairman Stephen Bollenbach on Saturday, ITT chairman Rand Araskog said it would be inappropriate for the executives to meet or for Bollenbach to address the ITT board on Tuesday as he had requested, the sources said.
The sources described Araskog's letter as brief and formal.
An ITT spokesman declined to comment and a Hilton spokesman in Los Angeles could not be immediately reached for comment.
Bollenbach's request to ITT was disclosed in a January 31 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Hilton, which is trying to buy ITT in a cash and stock deal valued at $55 per share, formally launched a hostile takeover of ITT on Friday. Hilton also has proposed acquiring about $4 billion of ITT debt for a total transaction worth $10.5 billion.  
Wall Street experts widely expect ITT to reject the offer, which is considered to be too low. Although its stock has declined sharply in recent months, most experts estimate ITT is worth at least $65 per share.
ITT's advisers have spent the past few days poring over the formal bid filed with the SEC on Friday. The advisers are expected to present an in-depth analysis of the offer when ITT holds a regularly scheduled board meeting on Tuesday.
The ITT board, which has until February 14 to respond to the Hilton offer, is not expected to make a decision at the Tuesday meeting.
Sources close to ITT told Reuters that the analysis was likely to focus on Hilton's proposed financing for the transaction and a preliminary agreement with HFS Inc to license the Sheraton franchise. Hilton, which has estimated it will need about $3.5 billion to buy ITT, said its offer is not conditioned on obtaining financing.
Hilton has estimated the proposed union would generate more than $100 million in cost savings.
Hilton also has said that while it would prefer to negotiate a transaction with ITT, it would be prepared to launch a proxy fight to replace the ITT board of directors.
"
RobinSidel,"CVS Corp., the nation's fifth-largest chain of drug stores, said Friday it will acquire rival Revco D.S. Inc. for $2.8 billion in stock and the assumption of $900 million of debt.
The planned union will create the nation's second largest drug store chain, dominating the eastern half of the country. It will have about 4,000 stores and annual sales of $13 billion, making it the largest in terms of outlets and second-largest behind Walgreen Co. in terms of total sales.
While the announcement did not state how many jobs might be eliminated in the merger, the companies said that Revco's Twinsburg, Ohio, headquarters would be phased out. Sources familiar with the companies said that most of the 1,000 people employed at the headquarters were likely to lose their jobs.
CVS Chief Operating Officer Thomas Ryan did not dispute those estimates, saying ""it's unfortunate,"" but he said the company will retain about 98 percent of Revco employees.
CVS said the new company, which will keep the name CVS, will be led by its existing senior management and retain the CVS headquarters in Woonsocket, R.I.
Revco Chief Executive Officer Dwayne Hoven will leave the company after the merger is completed.
""He will stay through the transition. He is intently interested in seeing to it that his people in Twinsburg are well taken care of,"" a Revco spokeswoman said.
The merger is the latest in the drugstore chain sector, which has seen intense consolidation in the past year.
The transaction will solidify CVS's position in the sector and allow it to expand significantly. Analysts said the companies have little geographic overlap and the combination is not expected to generate significant antitrust concerns.
CVS stores are located primarily in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions while Revco stores are mostly in Midwest and Southeast.
The merger calls for CVS to pay the equivalent of $40.64 in its shares for each share of Revco, based on Thursday's closing stock prices.
CVS stock closed Thursday at $44 a share and Revco at $38, both on the New York Stock Exchange, but moved higher Friday.
Revco added $3.375 to close at $41.375 in heavy trading while CVS gained $3.125 to $47.125, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ryan of CVS said the transaction would add to earnings slightly this year and would add another 10 cents to 15 cents per share in 1998.
""What we're trying to be is more than just a growth company -- a world-class healthcare retailer. And that's what I think this combination will do,"" he said in a telephone interview.
Analysts agreed.
""It's a great deal for CVS. The structure (of the deal) is going to allow it to be additive to earnings immediately,"" Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group said.
""(CVS and Revco) are the two most dominant market share players in the industry and market share is really the name of the game,"" he said.
Both companies acknowledged last month that they were discussing a combination of their businesses. Ryan said that the two companies began holding discussions in October.
Ryan said CVS also had considered an acquisition of Eckerd Corp., but decided that Revco was a better fit. J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which owns Thrift drug stores, announced a $3.3 billion acquisition of Eckerd in November.
Two shareholders likely to prosper from the merger are Revco CEO Hoven and Revco co-Chairman Sam Zell. Zell's Chilmark Fund LP holds a 19.2 percent stake in Revco and Hoven also has large holdings in the company.
CVS said the new company plans to open or relocate 300 stores a year after the merger is completed.
Analysts said the CVS-Revco union likely marks at least a near-term end to big mergers in the industry, although dozens of small chains still exist and are expected to get scooped up or join forces with bigger operators.
Revco had agreed in November, 1995, to merge with Rite Aid Corp. in a $1.8 billion deal, but that merger collapsed last April after federal and state regulators raised antitrust concerns.
Analysts said the companies have little goeographic overlap, and the union of CVS and Revco was not expected to generate significant antitrust concerns.
""A number of companies in the sector are coming to us and asking us what they should do strategically,"" said Marty Murrer, managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which advised CVS in the Revco deal and has been a key player in the sector's biggest transactions.
Arbor Drug Inc., Genovese Drug Stores Inc. and privately held Duane Reade Inc. have been cited as likely candidates to participate in the consolidation sweeping the sector.
"
RobinSidel,"CVS Corp on Friday said it expected its proposed $2.8 billion acquisition of Revco D.S. Inc to be slightly accretive in 1997 and add 10 to 15 cents to earnings per share in 1998.
""What we're trying to be is more than just a growth company -- a world-class health-care retailer. And that's what I think this combination will do,"" Chief Operating Officer Thomas Ryan told Reuters in a telephone interview.  
Ryan said that CVS had also considered an acquisition of Eckerd Corp but the transaction with Revco was determined to be a better fit. J.C. Penney Co Inc announced a $3.3 billion acquisition of Eckerd in November.
He said CVS and Revco had held talks since early October, adding that key criteria for strategic acquisitions pursued by CVS included leadership in new markets, growth potential in pharmacy operations and earnings accretion.
""We think combining these two entities across the largest retail store base in the country positions us pretty well for the managed-care environment going forward,"" Ryan said.  
""This will make us a stronger company on the retail side, and it also will strengthen us as a health-care player,"" he said, referring to CVS' patient benefit management company and Revco's mail-order operations.
The planned acquisition of Revco is expected to result in about 1,000 layoffs at the company's Twinsburg, Ohio, headquaters. CVS and Revco did not specifically cite those figures but did not dispute the estimates.
""It's unfortunate, but I like to think about the 98 percent of the people that we are employing at Revco,"" he said, adding that CVS would honor Revco severance packages.
Ryan said CVS might consider other acquisitions, although most of its attention was likely to be focused on Revco in the near term.
""We're always looking for the right opportunity, but obviously our focus is on maintaining the productivity and the customer service we've established at CVS and to begin to work on the transition at Revco,"" he said.
"
RobinSidel,"The union of CVS Corp and Revco D.S. Inc creates a drugstore powerhouse that will dominate the U.S. Northeast and Southeast and likely marks the near-term end of mergers between the industry's biggest players.
But dozens of small publicly held and private chains still exist and are expected to get scooped up or join forces to combat industry leaders such as Walgreen Co, Rite Aid Corp, J.C. Penney's Thrift and the new CVS.  
""A number of companies in the sector are coming to us and asking us what they should do strategically,"" said Marty Murrer, managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which advised CVS in the Revco deal and has been a key player in the sector's biggest transactions.
Arbor Drug Inc, Genovese Drug Stores Inc and  Duane Reade Inc have been cited as candidates likely to participate in the consolidation sweeping the drugstore sector.
The union of Revco and CVS signals the final move in a tumultuous year for Twinsburg, Ohio-based Revco.  
A $1.8 billion friendly merger agreement between Revco and Rite Aid collapsed last April after state and federal regulators contended a combination would create antitrust issues and potentially drive up consumer prices.
Then in September, Revco launched a hostile offer for Big B Inc, which initially rejected its bid. But Big B, a southeastern chain, was unable to rebuff Revco for long, and the companies struck a friendly, $380 million deal in October.
Shareholders reacted positively to the Revco-CVS union, bidding Revco shares up 2-1/2 to 40-1/2 by Friday afternoon. The $2.8 billion deal values Revco at about 40 per share.  
The transaction will solidify CVS's position in the sector and allow it to expand significantly. Analysts said the companies have little geographic overlap, and the union is not expected to generate significant antitrust concerns.
On Friday, CVS also disclosed an aggressive growth plan that calls for 300 new stores or relocations each year.
""It's a great deal for CVS. The structure (of the deal) is going to allow it to be additive to earnings immediately. (CVS and Revco) are the two most dominant market share players in the industry, and market share is really the name of the game,"" said Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group.  
Industry experts and Wall Street sources said Revco could have remained a viable company on its own. Revco and CVS last month confirmed their merger talks.
""I don't view this as a forced marriage. I view it as a marriage of great opportunity for the shareholders. Nobody has to do this,"" Murrer said.
Two shareholders likely to prosper from the merger are Revco Chief Executive Dwayne Hoven and Revco Co-chairman Sam Zell. Zell's Chilmark Fund LP holds a 19.2 percent stake in Revco. Hoven, who will not be joining the merged company, also has large holdings in Revco.
"
RobinSidel,"ITT Corp. on Wednesday rejected Hilton Hotels Corp.'s unsolicited $6.5 billion takeover offer and said it would consider a plan to sell non-core assets in an attempt to boost shareholder value.
New York-based ITT said the potential sale of the properties -- which could include its 50 percent stake in the famed Madison Square Garden arena and the New York Rangers hockey and New York Knicks basketball teams based there -- would be put into effect in order to focus on its Sheraton hotel and Caesars casino businesses.
Wall Street sources immediately estimated ITT could generate some $3 billion from asset sales and use the proceeds to buy back stock or issue a special dividend to investors.
They also warned the plan might not be effective enough to pacify ITT shareholders who have seen the company's stock price eroded in recent months.
""The issue is creating shareholder value, both short- and long-term,"" ITT Chairman Rand Araskog said in a news release. ""We plan to deploy our financial resources only to those assets that produce superior current and future earnings growth.""
ITT said Hilton's offer of $55 per share did not reflect the inherent value of ITT, which owns and operates Sheraton hotels and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas, Reno, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J.
ITT also said keeping the company independent would be in the best interests of its shareholders and other constituents, and that it would seek various options to increase the company's value.
In rejecting Hilton's offer, ITT also cited potential antitrust implications. It said there were ""serious business conflicts which have always confronted a (potential) Sheraton/Hilton combination,"" adding that owning and managing multiple hotels under each brand in dozens of the same cities would create material conflicts of interest.
The ITT rejection came one day after Hilton announced plans to take control of ITT by ousting its board of directors. It proposed 11 candidates for ITT's current board seats, and named 14 others who could be added if ITT attempts to thwart Hilton's bid by boosting the number of board members.
Hilton said its plans would not be altered by ITT's rebuff, adding its $55 bid was a solid offer.
Wall Street analysts widely expect Hilton to raise its bid, perhaps by as much as $10 per share.
""If Hilton comes back with $65, I think ITT will have trouble making a strong case to its shareholders,"" said Bruce Raabe of brokerage Collins &amp; Co.
An ITT spokesman said the company had no comment on what it might do if Hilton sweetened its offer. ""We will see what happens,"" he said.
Meanwhile, it appeared ITT was already moving forward with plans to sell some assets.
French telecommunications company Alcatel Alsthom said it has been approached by ITT for permission to sell some of its 5 percent stake before an agreed-on July deadline. ITT signed a shareholders agreement with Alcatel in 1992 that called for it to retain the stake until July 3.
An Alcatel spokesman declined to comment further, and an ITT spokesman could not be reached for comment on the issue.
Cablevision Systems Corp., which owns the other half of Madison Square Garden and has the first right to buy ITT's stake, declined to comment on speculation about a transaction. However, the company noted it previously has said it has an excellent relationship with ITT and Arkasog.
The Madison Square Garden properties include the New York Knicks professional basketball team, the New York Rangers professional hockey team, and other properties.
""It begs the question: why didn't they do it sooner?"" said Daniel Davila of brokerage Rodman &amp; Redshaw Inc. of the potential non-core asset sales.
As part of its response to Hilton's offer, ITT also said it was filing counterclaims to litigation Hilton filed against it in a federal court in Nevada.
ITT said it was seeking to block the offer and seeking other relief because of Hilton's ""misappropriation and misuse of confidential ITT information, including information obtained in violation of a 1996 confidentiality agreement between ITT and Bally Entertainment, now part of Hilton.""
Alternatively, ITT said, it was seeking to compel Hilton to disclose information about its offer required under federal securities laws.
Hilton said Wednesday it believed ITT's legal charges were ""without merit.""
ITT's stock rose $1.625 to $57.625 on the New York Stock Exchange while Hilton shares slipped 50 cents to $27.625, also on the NYSE.
"
RobinSidel,"ITT Corp will have a difficult time convincing investors that a sale of its non-core assets would be more valuable than a $6.5 billion hostile bid from rival Hilton Hotels Corp, Wall Street analysts said.
Although ITT would certainly be a better-focused company without assets like Madison Square Garden and world telephone directories, the move may come too late for shareholders who have seen the stock price erode in recent months.
""It begs the question:  Why didn't they do it sooner?"" said Daniel Davila of Rodman &amp; Redshaw Inc.  
As expected, ITT earlier rejected Hilton's $6.5 billion takeover offer as inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders.  The hotel, casino and entertainment giant will review options to increase shareholder value, including the potential sale of non-core assets.
Industry experts have estimated those assets could generate more than $2 billion that ITT could use to buy back stock or issue a special dividend to shareholders.
Meanwhile, Hilton is widely expected to raise its $55 per share offer for ITT, perhaps as much as another $10 per share.  
""If Hilton comes back with $65, I think ITT will have trouble making a strong case to its shareholders,"" said Bruce Raabe of Collins &amp; Co.
Shares of ITT jumped 1-3/4 to 57-3/4 in afternoon trading on views of a higher bid.
Analysts also said that stockholders will not want to wait for ITT to sell holdings while a Hilton offer is on the table.
Analysts and sources close to ITT have indicated the company would move quickly if it decides to sell assets and the stakes in Madison Square Garden and Alcatel Alsthom would be among the first to be sold.  
French telecommunications company Alcatel said it has been approached by ITT for permission to sell some of its five percent stake before an agreed-upon July deadline. ITT signed a shareholders agreement with Alcatel in 1992 that called for it to retain the stake until July 3.
And Cablevision, which owns the Madison Square Garden properties with ITT, reiterated that it has an excellent relationship with ITT and its chairman Rand Araskog.
Cablevision declined to comment on speculation that it would buy ITT's 50 percent of Madison Square Garden. It has rights of first refusal if ITT decides to sell the stake.  
Although the strategy may be a tough sell with shareholders, some industry experts noted that ITT's rejection was aggressive, well-planned and issued before Friday's response deadline.
""ITT has put the burden back on Hilton,"" said Bjorn Hanson of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, adding that ITT may still pursue an acquisition to stave off Hilton.
Meanwhile, Hilton had little reaction to ITT's rejection, saying only that the response does not change its plans or its intent.
"
RobinSidel,"Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc., a private investment firm, said Friday it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the food business of American Home Products Corp. for about $1.3 billion.
The business, which will be renamed American Home Food Products, sells packaged convenience foods primarily in the United States, with projected sales of about $1 billion in 1996.
Its products include Chef Boyardee prepared pasta products, pizza mixes, and dinner kits; PAM cooking spray, Franklin Crunch 'n Munch glazed popcorn; Polaner fruit spreads and spices; Gulden's mustard; Ranch Style Brand beans; Dennison's chili; Luck's beans; Ro-Tel tomato and chilies products; Jiffy Pop popcorn; Maypo and Wheatena hot cereals; and G. Washington broth. It also has strong foodservice and private label businesses.
American Home Products will receive about $1.2 billion in cash and will retain 20 percent of the common stock of its food unit, Hicks Muse said.
""Consistent with our proven approach of acquiring and building quality companies with exceptional management teams, this transaction provides a superb platform to execute a buy-and-build strategy in the branded food products business,"" said Michael Levitt, managing director of Hicks Muse.
The seven-year-old company, which has been gobbling up food businesses for several years, plans to buy two Mexican food firms this year, CEO Thomas Hicks said in a telephone interview.
""Our plan is to use this as a platform. We intend to start with this and grow both internally and through additional acquisitions of branded products,"" Hicks said of the Dallas-based firm's latest and largest transaction.
Hicks Muse bought dairy firm Morningstar Group in 1991 and took the company public in 1992. It also owns Campfire marshmallows and Angela Marie's. In March, it bought Ghirardelli Chocolate Co. from Boston buyout specialist Thomas Lee.
""We like established brands because we think they offer the most ability of cash flow and long-term growth potential,"" Hicks said.
An American Home spokesman said the company will use money from the sale to pay down debt and provide funds for ""future strategic uses."" The Madison, N.J.-based company had said in May that it was seeking buyers for the food unit.
""In general it's going to help them focus more on their pharmaceutical business and help them raise their gross margin,"" said Rodman &amp; Renshaw analyst Mario Corso.
""For (American Home) to sell a business that's probably growing at 2-5 percent over the next several years, they did very well,"" said Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Ian Sanderson.
American Home Products' stock rose $1.125 to $60.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading.
Sanderson said the food business was a ""laggard,"" with an estimated pretax profit margin of 11 percent. This compared with 18 percent to 22 percent for the rest of American Home's businesses, which include drugs such as Premarin hormone replacement therapy, medical devices, and consumer healthcare products including Advil pain reliever.
The company has said it has six new drugs it expects can generate over $500 million each in peak annual sales, including Rapamune for preventing organ rejection, a bone growth hormone factor and the Effexor line of anti-depressants.
""A year down the road maybe they'll have to reassess things, and if the pipeline projects haven't worked out, then they have to think about another big acquisition or something like that,"" Salomon Brothers analyst Robert Uhl said.
"
RobinSidel,"ITT Corp. said Thursday it sold nearly half of its 5 percent stake in Alcatel Alsthom, the big French telecommunications company, the first of several asset sales aimed at thwarting a $6.5 billion takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corp.
The sale of the 2.2 percent stake to an unidenified U.S. investment fund came one day after ITT rejected Hilton's offer and announced a plan to consider the sale of non-core assets and focus on its Sheraton hotel and Caesars casinos.
ITT and Alcatel declined to discuss the sale price, but a source close to ITT estimated it to be near the market value of about $300 million.
For its part, Hilton launched a fresh attack on ITT's plan.
""A fire sale of these assets will bring significantly less value than an orderly sale process,"" Hilton Chief Executive Stephen Bollenbach wrote in a letter to ITT Chairman Rand Araskog.
Industry analysts said Hilton would probably have to raise its $55-a-share bid for its takeover attempt to succeed but that was not expected anytime soon.
While sources close to ITT said the company was in no rush to sell off non-core assets, Alcatel granted special permission for ITT to sell part of the stake before July 3, a date that had been part of the original agreement.
ITT still holds 2.8 percent of Alcatel, though it was unclear if the French company had given permission for the sale of that portion.
The Alcatel stake had been considered the easiest of ITT's non-core assets for it to sell. The next asset to be sold is likely to be its Madison Square Garden properties, which include the world-famous arena, the New York Knicks basketball team and the New York Rangers hockey team.
Sources said ITT has held high-level talks with Cablevision about a transaction but that no deal has been struck. ITT partnered with Cablevision in 1995 to buy the properties.
Cablevision is ""the primary potential acquirer,"" said one source close to ITT who declined to be identified.
Cablevision declined to comment, referring to a statement Wednesday in which it said it does not comment on rumoured deals and noted it has a good relationship with ITT.
The ITT sources said it may take up to six months to sell the other non-core assets. Although ITT has held discussions with potential buyers about those properties, the talks are not in advanced stages, the sources said.
That was partly because ITT is not in a rush to sell non-core assets despite the looming Hilton bid, sources close to ITT said.
""The programme is to demonstrate to shareholders over the next couple of months that this management team and this plan will create greater value than the Hilton offer could provide,"" one source said.
""I don't think people should be looking for a single big bang here, but rather value creation over the course of the next few months,"" the source said.
ITT's other non-core assets include international telephone directories business.
Other people familiar with ITT's strategy said the company is unlikely to sell assets for less than a fair price.
""They're not going to give anything away. It's not their style,"" said one industry expert who did not want to be identified.
Meanwhile, sources also said ITT has hired Morgan Stanley to assist with the asset sales. ITT also is being advised by Lazard Freres and Chase Manhattan.
ITT declined to comment on the potential sales or the hiring of Morgan Stanley, which also declined to comment.
ITT's stock rose 62.5 cents to $58.25 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"
RobinSidel,"ITT Corp expects the sale of its non-core assets to take up to six months, although the Madison Square Garden properties are likely to be sold more quickly, according to sources close to the company.
The hotel, casino and entertainment company has held high-level talks with Cablevision Systems Corp about acquiring its 50 percent stake in Madison Square Garden, but no deal has been struck, the sources said.
Cablevision is ""the primary potential acquirer,"" said one source close to ITT who declined to be identified.  
Although ITT has held discussions with potential buyers about the other properties, which include its profitable international telephone directories business, those talks are not in advanced stages, the sources said.
Sources also said on Thursday that ITT has hired Morgan Stanley to assist with the asset sales. ITT also is being advised by Lazard Freres and Chase Securities.
ITT declined to comment on the potential sales or the hiring of Morgan Stanely. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman also declined to comment.  
ITT rejected a $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corp on Wednesday and said it would consider selling non-core assets to boost shareholder value.
ITT partnered with Cablevision in 1995 to buy the Madison Square Garden properties, which include the world-famous arena, the New York Knicks professional basketball team and the New York Rangers professional hockey team.
Cablevision declined to comment again today, referring to a Wednesday statement in which it said it does not comment on rumored deals and also noted it has a good relationship with ITT.
"
RobinSidel,"Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc will soon own Chef Boyardee, Polaner fruit spreads and PAM cooking spray, but the leveraged buy-out firm still has a big appetite for food companies.
The Dallas-based group, which announced on Friday a $1.3 billion acquisition of American Home Products Corp's food unit, plans to buy two Mexican food firms this year and does not intend to stop there, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hicks told Reuters in a telephone interview.  
""Our plan is to use this as a platform,"" he said of the American Home Products deal, the biggest ever for Hicks Muse. ""We intend to start with this and grow both internally and through additional acquisitions of branded products.""
Seven-year-old Hicks Muse has been digesting food businesses for several years. It bought dairy firm Morningstar Group in 1991 and took the company public in 1992.
In March it bought Ghirardelli Chocolate Co from Boston buy-out specialist Thomas Lee.
It also owns Campfire marshmallows and Angela Marie's.  
""We like established brands because we think they offer the most ability of cash flow and long-term growth potential,"" Hicks said.
He said his firm had been searching for a large food acquisition and was alerted to the American Home Products food business about six months ago. Most Wall Street analysts had expected the unit to be bought by another food company.
The devotion to the food industry by Hicks Muse comes as U.S. food companies undergo major cost-cutting and restructuring programs due to the maturation of key products and intense competition for supermarket shelf space.  
On Thursday Campbell Soup Co unveiled a plan to repurchase stock, cut jobs and expand overseas in an effort to boost profits in the mature industry. And Nabisco Holdings Corp announced in June that it would cut 4,200 jobs as part of a cost-cutting program.
Hicks said the buy-out firm will finalize plans to integrate American Home Products's food business by the time the deal closes in 60 to 90 days.
""We have a vision of what we are going to do,"" Hicks said, but declined to be specific.  
One of Hicks's savviest investments was in the 1980s when he and fellow Dallas investor Robert Haas built a beverage powerhouse through acquisitions of soda brands A&amp;W, Seven-Up, Dr. Pepper and Squirt.
But the Hicks Muse group ran into trouble with its 1994 $390 million purchase of G. Heileman Brewing Co, maker of Lone Star beer and other brands. In July it sold the brewer to Stroh Brewery Co for an estimated $275-$300 million.

RogerFillion,"Regional Baby Bell phone companies appear to have triumphed over their long-distance rivals in a crucial regulatory battle that would leave some customers paying less and others more for their monthly bill.
The Federal Communications Commission has decided against ordering a precipitous cut in the $23 billion long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp. pay the Bells each year for access to the local phone network, said FCC and industry officials.
Bell executives at one point feared such cuts could cost their companies as much as $10 billion in revenues. Consumer groups and long-distance companies advocate immediate cuts in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, saying that would mean a similar cut in long-distance rates.
""The Bells have dodged a bullet,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group. ""They may get grazed. But they dodged a bullet that was aimed at them during the last six months.""
Instead of a big FCC-imposed cut, the agency plans to rely on competition to lower access charges over time, said FCC and industry officials. That could mean an FCC-imposed loss of Bell revenues of no more than $1 billion the first year.
Less clear was the impact on phone customers.
Those who make lots of long-distance calls would see a sizeable drop in their bills, said FCC officials.
But wireless phone subscribers could pay anywhere from 1 percent to 2 percent more a month through new fees. Customers with more than one phone line for a computer or the kids and who make few long-distance calls would see a monthly rate rise of around $1 or more.
""We're cutting away the frills,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview.
""We're talking about a $1 subsidy per month that we're eliminating for somebody who's connecting a $2,500 computer to that line and purchasing $20 a month of unlimited access,"" said Hunt, a big advocate of the rules under consideration.
They are set to be voted on next week. Details may change.
FCC officials, meanwhile, say the plan would yield a cut in long-distance charges of more than $1 billion in the first year.
FCC officials oppose a steep cut for several reasons.
Citing rate hikes by AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp. late last year, they fear long-distance carriers may not fully pass on a major reduction to consumers and pocket some of the money. Long-distance executives vow to pass on the reductions.
FCC officials also fear a sharp cut would unleash a rise in local phone rates by carriers trying to recoup lost money.
""We're keeping basic residential dial tone at today's price,"" said Hundt.
Critics charge the plan would mean higher rates. AT&amp;T says long-distance customers will see a $1.5 billion jump at the outset in July. ""Regulators appear unlikely to squeeze the fat out of the Bells' prices, leaving consumers paying for inflated rates,"" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union.
But Hundt says that over the next five years at least $10 billion ""will be transferred to consumers"" via access cuts.
The plan also would pay for $3 billion to connect schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet and provide cheap phone service for the poor.
Access charges were created after the 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. Experts agree the $23 billion is more than the cost of providing local access. But they cannot agree on the amount.
FCC officials said 85 percent of the nation's 80 million residential phone customers would see a lower monthly bill.
Those who make lots of long-distance calls would benefit the most, because the agency plans to replace some of the existing per-minute access charges with a monthly flat rate.
The 15 percent of residents who do not make long-distance calls would see their bills stay the same.
But customers with more than one line and who make few long-distance calls are likely to see a rate rise.
That's because the ceiling, or cap, on the existing ""subscriber line charge"" is expected to rise to $5 a month from $3.50 for each additional residential line, and to roughly $7 a line for multi-line business customers from $6.
One possible way around the charge may be for customers to list their additional lines in a different name or use another local carrier, said industry officials.

Meanwhile, large businesses or consumers who make a lot of long-distance calls could well see a drop in their phone bill because the FCC plans to lower the permanent access charge to about two cents a minute from about 5.4 cents.
To make up the lost revenues, the FCC plans to require long-distance carriers to pay local carriers a new monthly ""pre-subscribed line charge"" for each long-distance customer.
The charge -- which will range from 75 cents a month for single-line residents to $4.50 a month a line for multi-line businesses -- are intended to better reflect the actual costs of using the local phone network.

RogerFillion,"The Justice Department is investigating possible bid rigging during airwaves auctions held by the federal government for wireless phone licenses.
Justice Department documents obtained Wednesday by Reuters showed the department's antitrust division also is looking into whether bidders schemed illegally to divvy up the licenses being sold.
The Federal Communications Commission has raised more than $20 billion since 1995 by selling licenses to companies offering a new generation of cellular phone service known as ""personal communications services,"" or PCS.
A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the investigation. She said the antitrust division was ""looking into the possibility of anticompetitive conduct by bidders in connection with the FCC's auctioning of spectrum for PCS.""
She declined to comment on whether the investigation covers all three of the big PCS auctions that have been held. But sources familiar with the matter said the department is seeking information from companies about all of the sales.
The department documents focus on the PCS auction that ended in mid-January and raised $2.5 billion. It involved dozens of bidders.
At that auction, the FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making it the most licenses sold at once. A third of the licenses were reserved for small-company bidders.
Top bidders were units of Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T Corp. and BellSouth Corp.
A spokesman for Atlanta-based BellSouth said the company had not been informed by the government of any investigation.
A spokesman for New York-based AT&amp;T said the No. 1 long-distance carrier had received a request for information from the Justice Department and intended to coperate fully.
A spokeswoman at Westwood, Kan.-based Sprint had no immediate comment.
Attorneys familiar with the investigation said the department has sent out ""numerous"" letters requesting information and documents from auction participants.
The ""civil investigative demand"" seeks information about companies' bids, their bidding strategies and communications about the auction with other telecommunications firms.
In a sign that the investigation is looking into the possibility of bid ""signaling"" among participants, the department requested documents showing the last three digits of company bids.
One attorney familiar with the investigation said it was evident during the bidding that companies used the last three digits of their dollar bidding figure to signal their intentions to other auction participants.
""It's clear a certain amount of this was taking place,"" said the attorney, who spoke on condition of not being identified.
Attorneys expect antitrust investigators will focus on whether companies used such practices to stay out of each other's markets during bidding, or to influence prices.
In particular, investigators are expected to probe whether some of the bidding practices merely represented bluffing, or were indeed antitrust violations, said attorneys.
Companies hired academics and game theorists to help advise during the PCS sales.
FCC officials declined to comment on the investigation.
But sources said the agency had been alerted about the practice of ""signaling.""
Attorneys said a company involved in the January PCS auction, High Plains Wireless LP, had asked the FCC to take away Mercury PCS II LLC's licenses. High Plains accused Mercury of improper signalling involving licenses in Texas.
Mercury has denied the charge.
The Justice Department investigation comes at a rocky time for the FCC's airwaves sales. An auction that ended last week raised a disappointing $13.6 million, with licenses for some wireless communications markets fetching just $1 apiece.
The total was way below the $1.8 billion that Congress was banking on to help eliminate the federal deficit.

RogerFillion,"Congress is gearing up to try and make changes to the way the government auctions the airwaves, following a recent sale that fell flat and a new Justice Department investigation into possible bid-rigging.
Lawmakers said Thursday they are eyeing bills or offering legislation to maximize the money the federal government raises through spectrum sales. That comes after some wireless communications licenses auctioned last week feteched just $1 apiece, and the antitrust probe put a further tarnish on the sales.
Bills being offered would set minimum bidding levels or slow the flow of airwave slices into the market by holding federal auctions only at selected intervals. The Clinton administration is studying the measures.
Congress has relied heavily on the Federal Communications Commission auctions as a one-time way to help cut the deficit. ""We had a great success with the early auctions that raised over $23 billion. But it became like candy. And the budgeteers just couldn't put it down,"" Representative Mike Oxley, an Ohio Republican who first introduced auction legislation in 1993, said in an interview.
""At the very least, we ought to have some hearings and try to educate members (of Congress), the public, and particularly the budgeteers, that they're really playing with fire here."" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who chairs the commerce committee, wants the FCC to pay ""more attention to the market forces"" when it auctions spectrum for uses ranging from a new generation of cellular phones to satellite television.
""The last thing we want to do is have a distortion of the marketplace which would then cost people involved in the free enterprise system and the taxpayers,"" he said in an interview. McCain is preparing to offer a bill to keep spectrum from being dumped on the market.
But some analysts are wary of tinkering with the process. ""The idea that Congress can figure whether there's too much or too little spectrum -- or the right price -- I find arrogant and presumptuous,"" said Bill Bane, director at Mercer Management Consulting Inc.
The importance of airwave sales to the budget process was driven home by last week's disappointing auction. The sale -- for a piece of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet or create wireless local telephone networks -- raised just $13.6 million. That was a far cry from the $1.8 billion Congress was counting on to cut the deficit. FCC officials blamed the results on lawmakers' requirement to hold the auction by mid-April and to end it in time to help reduce red ink in the current 1997 fiscal year. They said companies did not have enough time to develop business plans.
""This was a good example of one that was ordered prematurely,"" Representative W. J. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee, said in an interview.
    ""It's a problem that has to do with our budgeteers ordering auctions that may be inappropriate, not with the auction process itself,"" added the Louisiana Republican.     Sen. Robert Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, offered a bill this week to set a minimum price for each airwave parcel sold. ""With a reserve pricing system, taxpayers will be guaranteed that national assets are not sold for a song,"" he said.
    Meanwhile, lawmakers are in no hurry to offer bills in response to the Justice Department probe of possible bid-rigging at auctions for advanced cellular-phone licenses. But the news put a further spotlight on the auctions.     ""This whole topic of spectrum auctions has become -- crazily enough -- kind of sexy,"" quipped House Commerce Committee aide Dennis Fitzgibbons.
"
RogerFillion,"Regulators are expected Wednesday to adopt a landmark overhaul of the nation's telephone charges to better spread the financial pain of ensuring affordable phone service for Americans.
The Federal Communications Commission also hopes its controversial revamp will spur the $200 billion phone industry to compete more fiercely for residential customers -- and not just wealthy businesses.
""We're trying to reform the system of charges and subsidies to make it more compatible with competition,"" said FCC Chief Economist Joseph Farrell.
The new rules, which stem from last year's communications law, are designed to keep basic residential phone rates at current levels. Businesses and residences who make plenty of long-distance calls would see their monthly phone bill drop the most, according to industry officials.
Residential and business customers with more than one phone line but who make few or no long-distance calls are expected to see their costs rise. That would mean an added $1 or more a month to maintain a home computer on a second line.
Aside from jump-starting competition, the rejigging in charges is meant to cover the $2 billion to $3 billion cost of wiring schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet, while also keeping phone service affordable for the poor.
Progress occurred this past weekend after AT&amp;T Corp. promised to lower its long-distance rates 5 percent to 15 percent if the FCC agreed to a hefty cut in the charges long-distance carriers pay to access the local phone network.
AT&amp;T Corp. sought a $1.7 billion upfront reduction in the $23 billion a year in access charges long-distance carriers pay the Baby Bells and other local phone companies.
Industry officials expect the FCC to ratify the reduction, paving the way for AT&amp;T to offer its first big rate cut since 1992. Other long-distance carriers are likely to follow suit.
The AT&amp;T pledge -- while drawing criticism from members of Congress and small businesses -- was applauded by consumer groups who until then had attacked the FCC's plans.
""This calms the waters more than otherwise,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group.
Industry executives also expect the rules will:
-- Keep the monthly ""subscriber line charge"" customers pay to the local phone company at $3.50.
-- Boost the charge for residential customers with more than one line to $5 a month from $3.50, and to roughly $7 from $6 for for multi-line businesses.
-- Require long-distance companies to pay local carriers a new ""pre-subscribed line charge"" for each long-distance customer. The charge could be passed on to customers and is expected to range from 75 cents a month for single-line residents to $4.50 for multi-line businesses.
""Second phone lines for home-based business or Internet use and small businesses will be saddled with the brunt of these increases,"" complained the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy group.
The FCC plan also is drawing flak from members of Congress anxious to see that local phone rates do not rise -- especially in reaction to AT&amp;T's weekend announcement.
""Any local telephone rate increases resulting from the (FCC's) actions to modify access charges would be sharply contrary to congressional intent in passing (last year's law),"" Sen. John McCain (R-Az.) and Reps. W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.) and John Dingell wrote FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.
Analysts said that Congress, in passing last year's bill, saddled the FCC with a mammoth task. ""They're trying to bring about a system that will be more conducive to competition while navigating around some very perilous political shoals,"" said Dwight Allen of Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting Group.
"
RogerFillion,"Regulators Wednesday approved a landmark overhaul of domestic telephone charges that they said will lower costs for residential and business customers who make plenty of long-distance calls.
Federal Communications Commimssion officials said basic local phone rates will stay the same. But consumers and businesses will pay more for extra phone lines and would see see their bills rise if they seldom dial long distance.
The FCC also voted to set aside about $2.3 billion a year to wire the nation's schools and libraries to the Internet at discounted rates. Another $400 million a year will be used to connect rural hospitals to the global computer network.
The new rates stem from last year's communications law and generally were praised by consumer advocates. Regional Baby Bell phone companies criticised the rules. And small-business advocates complained they will receive higher phone bills.
The matter ultimately is expected to land in court.
According to the FCC, the overhaul will mean that:
-- Residential customers with one phone line will see their long-distance bill drop to $20.65 a month from $22.50 by 1998, on average.
-- A couple with two phone lines in Charleston, S.C., and a long-distance bill of $60 a month, under a special calling plan, would save a total of about $2.50 a month.
-- But a funeral-parlour operator or other small business with three phone lines and just 15 minutes in long-distance calls would see their phone bill rise about $13, to $170.
""This is the single best day that business and residential customers have had since the (1984) breakup of AT&amp;T,"" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.
""We are not raising local rates. We are not making it a necessity to raise local rates,"" he added. ""Long-distance prices are going down.""
But BellSouth Corp. warned that the rules would lead to higher local rates. It and other Bells said the FCC went too far in ordering cuts in the $23 billion that long-distance carriers pay for access to their networks each year.
AT&amp;T Corp. called the plan a ""good compromise."" But No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp. said the FCC did not cut access charges enough. The carriers have vowed to pass on rate reductions to their customers.
Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, disputed the impact on Baby Bell and long-distance phone stocks.
The overhaul, in particular, will:
-- Keep the monthly ""subscriber line charge"" customers pay the local phone company at $3.50.
-- Boost the line charge for household customers with more than one line to $5 a month per additional line from $3.50, and to more than $7.50 from $6 for multi-line businesses.
Further increases will be capped at $9. But the average is expected to be below that ceiling. The average residential fee is expected to be no more than $7.60.
-- Impose a new monthly charge on long-distance carriers that is expected to be passed on to customers. The charge will be $1.50 a line for multi-line residential customers and $2.75 a line for businesses with more than one line.
-- Cut by $1.7 billion the $23 billion in annual charges long-distance carriers pay local companies to access their networks, effective July 1.
-- Reduce access charges by a total of $18.5 billion over the five years.
In a move that broke a logjam at the FCC, AT&amp;T promised to pass on the access-charge reductions to customers through long-distance price cuts of 5 percent to 15 percent. Other long-distance carriers have signalled they will follow suit.
Debra Berlyn of the Competition Policy Institute, a consumer group, praised the FCC ""for its resolve to avoid any increase"" in basic local phone rates.
But few carriers were happy with the plan -- possibly a sign that the FCC had achieved the balance it was seeking.
MCI called the $1.7 billion access-charge reduction ""a first step."" ""Much more needs to be done,"" MCI President Timothy Price said.
GTE Corp. -- which filed suit against the FCC's sweeping rules last fall to pry open local phone monopolies -- said: ""It is difficult to understand public policy which penalises consumers for hooking up to the information superhighway by increasing the price of second lines.""
Analyst George Reed-Dellinger at HSBC Washington Analysis predicted the FCC's decision would benefit long-distance phone stocks and hamper local phone stocks.
But analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Research Group said: ""There was a lot of huffing and puffing, but this is incremental change and not revolutionary change.""

The new rates mean residential customers with one phone line will see their long-distance bill drop to $20.65 a month from $22.50 by 1998, on average, according to FCC calculations.
""This is the single best day that business and residential customers have had since the (1984) breakup of AT&amp;T,"" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.
The overhaul also will:

-- Boost the line charge for residential customers with more than one line to $5 a month from $3.50, and to more than $7.50 from $6 for multi-line businesses. Those increases will take effect next year and be followed by additional rises that ultimately will be capped at $9.
-- Impose a new monthly charge on long-distance carriers that is expected to be passed on to customers. The charge will be $1.50 a line for multi-line residential customers and $2.75 a line for businesses with more than one line.

AT&amp;T Corp. has promised to pass on the savings in access charges to customers through long-distance price cuts of 5 percent to 15 percent. Other long-distance carriers have signalled they will follow suit.
Phone companies gave the rate overhaul mixed ratings.
AT&amp;T generally praised the plan, but No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp. said the access charge reductions did not go far enough.
Regional phone compannies Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp., which are merging, questioned the access-charge rate cut.
Industry analysts, meanwhile, also offered mixed views.

"
RogerFillion,"The House approved legislation Wednesday to usher in the largest overhaul of the federal public housing programme since its creation in the New Deal era of President Franklin Roosevelt.
The bill, approved 293-132, ends many federal rules and is meant to give local housing authorities more power and leeway to run the nation's 13,200 public housing developments.
Officials would have more authority to raise and lower rents and select who occupies low-income housing. The legislation would scrap the landmark Housing Act of 1937.
The Clinton administration opposes the measure, saying it would throw the very poor out of public housing and replace them with moderate-income residents. Administration officials hope to craft a compromise between the bill and a less-deregulatory version in the Senate closer to their liking.
Supporters of the House bill say it would help make public-housing residents less reliant on government programmes. And they argue it would encourage tenants to assume a greater role in their community. Unemployed tenants would have to perform community service without pay -- a provision Democrats liken to slavery.
Opponents also charge the legislation would punish the poor, abandon the government's commitment to the needy, and possibly swell the ranks of the homeless.
""The Republicans over the next 10 years will throw 80 percent of the very poor out of public housing,"" said Massachusetts Democrat Representative Joseph Kennedy.
But New York Republican Representative Rick Lazio, argued: ""The House has taken a bold and decisive step to reverse the failed federal housing policies of the last 60 years. We are transforming public housing from a way of life into a way to a better life.""
The House and Senate passed separate bills in 1996 but failed to iron out a compromise before Congress adjourned.
The new bill covers the nearly seven million people living in public housing or receiving rental aid. Today, the federal government contracts with the nation's 3,400 public housing authorities, which own and operate the housing developments.
In exchange for federal dollars, housing authorities run the programmes under close scrutiny from the federal government.
The House bill would:
-- Combine about a dozen spending programmes into two block grants to be administered by local public-housing authorities.
-- Mandate that 35 percent of public housing residents be among the very poor with incomes of no more than 30 percent of a community's median income. Current law has a 75 percent ceiling on the number of extremely poor residents.
-- Require able-bodied, unemployed persons who live in public housing or who receive rental assistance to perform eight hours a month of community service or get job training.
-- Allow tenants to pay either a flat rent or an amount up to 30 percent of their income. Supporters argue the existing system, which links a tenant's rent to income, creates a disincentive to work because rent increases with income.
-- Make it easier to evict drug dealers and criminals from public housing, and demolish and replace decrepit housing.
-- Require speedy improvement of troubled public housing authorities or the ouster of their management.
-- Let local governments enter pacts with HUD to receive public housing money and rental assistance funds directly from the federal government. Local officials would have to adhere to certain standards, but would get more flexibility to spend the money in ways tailored to their individual needs.
The legislation would authorise spending of $6.1 billion for the 1998 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, and a total of $29.5 billion through 2002.

RogerFillion,"A year after the ValuJet Inc. crash, the top airline regulator suggested Thursday it would be impractical to force air carriers to install fire-safety equipment in passenger cargo holds in less than three years.
Under fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety, the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire suppressors in all passenger cargo holds over three years.
House lawmakers, however, accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue, despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so. Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable.
""It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet,"" Barry Valentine, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told a House panel.
""That's the decision. How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation,"" he said.
But Representative John Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican, responded, ""I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible. And if they have to be a little slower, the public probably would like them to be a little slower.""
Airline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft, after initially balking at the dual requirement.
FAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash.
""This is pathetic. The FAA is pathetic. The industry is pathetic,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. ""Any more needless deaths and we're going to crucify you.""
The FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules, which will affect about 3,000 aircraft. But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal.
""Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?"" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee.
Valentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the ""final assembly.""
ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners.
The head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24.
""It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States,"" Hall said.
An FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB.

Under fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety, the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire supressers in all passenger cargo holds over three years.
House lawmakers, however, accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue, despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so. Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable.
""It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet,"" Barry Valentine, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told a House panel.
""That's the decision. How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation,"" he said.
But Representative John Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican, responded, ""I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible. And if they have to be a little slower, the public probably would like them to be a little slower.""
Airline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft, after initially balking at the dual requirement.
FAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash.
""This is pathetic. The FAA is pathetic. The industry is pathetic,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. ""Any more needless deaths and we're going to crucify you.""
The FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules, which will affect about 3,000 aircraft. But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal.
""Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?"" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee.
Valentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the ""final assembly.""
ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners.
The head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24.
""It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States,"" Hall said.
An FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB.

RogerFillion,"Opponents of U.S. trade concessions to China are expected to mount the fiercest congressional battle in years to overturn President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's favoured trading status.
While supporters of the president's decision on Monday to renew China's most favoured nation (MFN) status for another year remain confident of victory, opponents -- ranging from social conservatives to organised labour -- are revving up for a fight.
The unusual coalition is blasting the move from both sides of the political spectrum, hitting China's policies on human rights, labour rights, religious rights, trade and abortion.
Opponents are also gathering strength from worries over the transfer this summer of Hong Kong to China, as well as the brouhaha over charges that Beijing tried to sway U.S. elections through illegal campaign contributions.
""With Hong Kong and campaign finance lurking in the background, it will definitely be a tougher fight,"" a congressional aide, who requested anonymity, said. ""A lot depends on what happens between now and the vote.""
Another congressional aide said, ""The coalition of the AFL-CIO and social conservatives makes for a potent force.""
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said this year's decision would be closer than last year's 286-141 vote in the House to back Clinton on MFN. But advocates and even opponents expect the president's policy ultimately to survive.
Even if lawmakers muster enough votes to reject the president's decision -- which is considered unlikely -- opponents doubt they could round up the two-thirds vote needed to override an expected veto from Clinton.
Congress later this summer will vote on whether to overturn Clinton's decision, with the House voting first.
""The opponents have a better chance than they have had in the past several years. But it still may not be enough of a margin to withstand a veto,"" said Thea Lee, international expert at the AFL-CIO, which opposes MFN status for China.
But even a defeat for MFN's opponents could amount to a sort of victory if the vote is close enough.
""It represents an important turning point in the growing uneasiness among both Democrats and Republicans over the current China trade policy,"" Lee said.
Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said: ""The president's action represents the high-water mark of the pro-MFN forces. As the truth of the human rights violations in China reaches the American public, the case for MFN collapses.""
A sign Clinton will face tougher sledding emerged a week ago, when an influential House Republican leader urged the president to revoke China's MFN status, citing Beijing's record on human rights, weapon sales and trade.
Representative Bill Paxon of New York, a Gingrich ally who chairs meetings of the Republican House leadership team, said current U.S. policy had yielded only ""a Chinese regime which thumbs its nose at the United States and places its heel on the neck of freedom.""
Democratic lawmakers echo that view.
Since Clinton ""delinked trade from human rights three years ago, the human rights situation in China and Tibet has deteriorated, the U.S. trade deficit with China has soared, and China's authoritarian government has continued its sale of nuclear, chemical, missile and biological weapons technology to dangerous countries, including Iran,"" Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said.
But supporters of the administration's policy remain confident. ""In the end, the votes will be there for MFN,"" said Calman Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, representing the heads of big U.S. corporations.

RogerFillion,"The Clinton administration Thursday threw its support behind legislation to prevent state and local governments from slapping new taxes on the Internet, giving a boost to a bill opposed by state and local officials.
The bill would impose an indefinite moritorium during which state and local governments could not tax the Internet, companies that provide access to the global computer netowrk, as well as electronic commerce conducted in cyberspace.
The legislation -- introduced in the House and the Senate -- would not affect existing taxes on goods and services ordered through the Internet, as long as the taxes are the same as those on mail-order transactions.
The moratorium is intended to give the Clinton administration time to develop a broad plan to address the issue of taxes on electronic commerce.
""Treasury wholeheartedly supports the goals and underlying objectives of the Internet Tax Freedom Act,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications.
""Unreasonable taxation of the Internet, or even the fear of unreasonable taxation, could be a significant impediment to the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce.""
But state and local officials said the bill would intrude on their powers and create budget problems.
""We believe that an indefinite moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet or on-line services would be a significant infringement on state and local sovereignty, create considerable budgetary problems for local governments and lead to unfair competition in the marketplace,"" said Timothy Kaine, a council member from Richmond, Va., who spoke on behalf of a variety of state and local organizations.
The National Governors Association also opposes the bill.
Key lawmakers in both houses of Congress have signaled a willingness to move quickly on the legislation.
The bill comes as state and local tax collectors have been eyeing the rapidly growing Internet computer network as a source of revenue to bolster their coffers.
Some states already are imposing taxes on companies that link consumers or businesses to the Internet, or that offer computer bulletin boards and electronic mail.
In Microsoft Corp.'s home state of Washington last year, the city of Tacoma decided to impose a six percent tax on companies that link residents to the Internet. But the city council later voted to repeal the plan.
""The present pattern of taxes on electronic commerce can best be described as a crazy quilt. The Internet may be the new frontier, but the way it's taxed looks like Dodge City before the marshals showed up,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is sponsoring the bill.
Added the bill's sponsor in the House, Rep. Christopher Cox, a California Republican: ""That taxes might drive the Internet to an early grave is not hyperbole, but a very real possibility.""

RogerFillion,"Regulators are considering ways to make it easier for cash-strapped winners at last year's $10.2 billion wireless phone auction to pay Uncle Sam for their licenses, government and industry officials said.
Congress is counting on the proceeds to trim the deficit.
But many of the companies that won licenses to offer a new generation of cellular phone service are now in financial hot water, raising doubts over whether the government will collect all the money owed.
Any steps the Federal Communications Commission takes will send a message to future bidders and affect future airwave sales. The FCC ""is going to be setting a new precedent,"" a government official said.
Government and industry officials said the FCC is considering restructuring the payments that last year's auction winners must make to the government. The agency is expected soon to put out different proposals for public comment.
The bids have become loans from the government, with the winners paying interest on the money that's due for licenses to offer ""personal communications services,"" or PCS.
The companies paid what were considered high prices. Many have since found it tough to raise financing.
The options under study at the FCC include:
-- Handling each company in a case-by-case manner. That way, payments could be restructured on an individual basis.
-- Deferring payments for a number of years -- say five, for example -- after which companies would make their interest payments and then pay off the remaining principal amount due. The breathing space would give companies time to build their PCS networks and make some money.
-- Letting winners pay, up front, a discounted lump sum based on interest payments otherwise due in the future.
The FCC also has been negotiating with the Treasury Department for help and advice. The FCC is ""not particularly expert in this area and never expected to be in it,"" the government official said.
In addition, several winners -- including top bidder NextWave Telecom Inc. -- have asked the FCC for permission to make interest payments yearly, instead of quarterly.
Last month, the FCC suspended the quarterly payments while it mulled the request -- a move that, according to one estimate, is costing the government $1.5 million daily.
Government and industry officials said the FCC is in a tough spot, especially because Congress is depending on the auction revenues to help balance the government's books.
If companies were to default on their payments and the FCC were to reauction the licenses, the new prices probably would be far less than the original amounts bid, analysts agreed.
Many of the auction winners ""will soon face financial crises if the FCC does not act swiftly and decisively to change the license payment terms,"" MCI Communications Corp. told the FCC earlier this month.
The No. 2 long-distance company -- which has signed a deal with NextWave to lease the company's PCS network to provide wireless services to it own customers -- wants the FCC to handle the companies' problems on a case-by-case basis.
But others urge the FCC to reject that approach. They want the agency to develop a general rule -- through its usual rulemaking process -- that would apply to all companies.
""We are concerned that whatever the FCC does, it does it fairly and equally across the board,"" attorney Mark Tauber of Piper &amp; Marbury said. ""It's bad 'PR' for the commission if they give the idea that special deals are available.""
AirGate Wireless, which won four PCS licenses at an auction that ended early this year, wants the FCC to take more aggressive action: reinstate the quarterly interest payments; declare companies in default companies that fail to make payments; and reauction the licenses of those in default.
""Anything less sends a message to existing licensees and future auction bidders that the FCC will provide a financial safety net for bidders that bid beyond their financial capabilities,"" the Washington-based firm told the FCC.
Meanwhile, the companies are expected to get some help from a recent global trade agreement that will make it easier for foreign communications companies to invest in U.S. carriers. The FCC is developing a proposal to implement the agreement, which could pave the way for foreign sources of money.
"
RogerFillion,"The nation's top communications regulator said Tuesday he will resign as head of the Federal Communications Commission.
Saying he wanted to spend more time with his family and complete two books, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said he asked President Bill Clinton to begin looking for a replacement. Hundt's term does not expire until June 30, 1998.
The new FCC chief must be cleared by the Senate. Hundt, who said he does not yet have future professional plans, will remain a voting member of the five-member FCC in the meantime.
He said he will remain as FCC chairman until a successor is installed.
""I expect that I'll be here for some time yet,"" Hundt, 49, told a news conference. ""I don't have any plans with anybody whatsoever.""
Hundt, a close ally of Vice President Al Gore, became chairman in November 1993. During his controversial 3-1/2-year tenure to date, he has presided over implementing last year's big communications law and requiring television broadcasters to air 3 hours a week of educational TV for children.
Among those considered possible successors are Susan Ness, a current FCC commissioner, and the agency's general counsel, William Kennard. Clinton nominated Kennard last Friday to fill one of two commissioner slots already vacant.
Other possible replacements include: Kathy Wallman, now a senior White House economic aide and formerly the head of the FCC's common carrier bureau; and Ralph Everett, a Washington attorney and former Senate staff member.
""Chairman Hundt has been a strong and visionary leader of the FCC during this historic period in telecommunications policy,"" Clinton said in a statement.
Clinton praised Hundt's ""steadfast commitment to the public interest and to bringing the benefits of competition to consumers.""
Hundt's departure -- and the arrival of new commissioners in coming months -- are expected to generate new uncertainties about federal communications policy.
""It could potentially be a huge change,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Legg Mason Precursor, a unit of the brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc. ""If it's anything like previous transitions, (FCC) chairmen can reinvent the wheel.""
Hundt has moved aggressively to implement last year's communications law and pry open local phone monopolies to competition -- although a key part of that effort is embroiled in a court fight against regional Baby Bell phone companies.
Hundt also has overseen the granting of free licenses to TV stations for the introduction of high-definition digital TV and moved to open foreign markets to competition.
""He is in no small part responsible for the pro-competitive revolution in telecommunications that is sweeping the globe,"" said attorney Scott Harris of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.
But Hundt often clashed with key members of Congress and the Baby Bells, who complained that his FCC policies amounted to micro-managing of the communications industry.
""His departure is fitting and timely,"" said Representative W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin, R-La., adding that Hundt ""remains a good friend and a person I deeply respect"" despite policy differences between the two.
Tauzin, the head of the powerful House Telecommunications Subcommittee, told Reuters that under the next chairman the FCC has ""got to be an agency that tries to downsize itself and its influence on the industry.""
Broadcasters also have criticised Hundt's policies.
But consumer advocates generally have praised Hundt's stands on issues ranging from children's TV to opening the $100 billion local phone market to competition.

RogerFillion,"The judge who oversaw the dismantling of the old Ma Bell is worried that a corporate marriage involving the new AT&amp;T Corp. could create the kind of ""monolith"" the historic breakup was supposed to do away with.
Federal Judge Harold Greene in 1982 ordered that the Bell system monopoly be split up. For more than a decade he then presided over the consent agreement that created the seven regional Baby Bell phone companies and the new AT&amp;T, the nation's No. 1 long-distance carrier.
AT&amp;T now is in talks to merge with SBC Communications Inc. -- currently the largest provider of local phone service -- in what would be an estimated $50 billion-plus transaction. It would by far and away be the biggest such deal in history.
""The basic assumption of the breakup was that you couldn't have competition, fair competition, as long as there was this massive company that encompassed all areas of the country and all types of service,"" Judge Greene told Reuters.
""And the same theory that led to the breakup,"" he added, ""could lead one to be suspicious at least of the reemergence of the same monolith.""
Judge Greene -- now more of an observer of the telecom business rather than an overseer -- frets that market conditions have not changed that much since the breakup of the Bell monopoly and the consent decree that took effect in 1984. The decree set limits on how the phone industry operated.
He believes competition has yet to take full root, despite last year's telecommunications act that tore down decades-old barriers and let the local and long-distance phone companies and cable-television operators enter each other's business.
""There are lots of things that need to be done yet -- both to get the long-distance companies into local service, and local companies into long-distance service. Nothing is perfected yet,"" Judge Greene said.
""It seems kind of surprising that they would now reconstitute the AT&amp;T empire, at least in one part,"" he added.
""I would hope that regulators -- the Federal Communications Commission and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice -- will be very cautious in approving something like that.
Judge Greene's policing duties in the telecom business ended with the new communications act. Since the law's passage, there has been an explosion in merger activity.
SBC recently acquired former Baby Bell Pacific Telesis Group. Bell Atlantic Corp. is in the process of acquiring NYNEX Corp. And British Telecommunications Plc is in the midst of buying No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp.
It's reported that a merger of AT&amp;T and San Antonio, Texas-based SBC would have combined revenues of some $80 billion and a workforce of 240,000.
SBC's regional phone system includes California and Texas, following the carrier's purchase of PacTel.
""I'm surprised that somebody wants to put Humpty Dumpty back together,"" said Judge Green, adding that any new corporate monolith would run counter to the intent of the new telecom law.
""Certainly I think it was the spirit of the act that there not be a return to monopoly conditions,"" he said.

SamuelPerry,"Sun Microsystems Inc. and its partners will Wednesday launch initiatives aimed at making its Java computing platform more speedy on devices ranging from smart cards to supercomputers.
Just two years after the unveiling of Java, a language for programming computers which began as a tiny project within Sun that was nearly scuttled, it has created an awkward alliance between fierce rivals.
Wednesday's proceedings, to be witnessed by thousands of computer developers in San Francisco, will not be without controversy.
Down the hall from where Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNeally and other Java luminaries will be giving keynote addresses, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates is due to showcase Microsoft's own implementations of Java.
""Certainly the center of the nuclear attack is going to be right here at ground zero in San Francisco,"" Gartner Group analyst David Smith said of the duelling keynotes.  
The pre-conference hype in the industry over the JavaOne conference reached such grand proportions that San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown issued a proclamation designating this week as ""Java Week"" in the city.
Analysts see Java -- which promises to enable programmers to write one piece of software that can run across all computer systems -- as a technology that will eventually creep into pretty much every company's systems.
Sun hopes that by de-emphasizing individual platforms, especially Microsoft's Windows operating systems which are themselves nearly ubiquitous on business and home PCs, it can level the playing field and extend sales of systems like its Solaris Unix platform, analysts said.
International Business Machines Corp. and virtually every other major computer systems maker, including PC industry giants Microsoft and Intel Corp., have clambered aboard the Java bandwagon.
But Gates, who is not used to playing second fiddle, and other industry players over time are expected to vie with Sun for leadership of the growing number of developers entranced with Java, now estimated at 400,000.

SamuelPerry,"Intel Corp. stock fell for the third straight day Friday on concerns that a series of upcoming price cuts could slow the company's momentum.
The stock tumbled $6.75 to $130.50, off a total of $16.125, or roughly 11 percent, since Tuesday.
The fall led the entire market lower, and analysts cited nervousness about Intel's first-quarter results, due after the market close on Monday. The earnings report will serve as a critical barometer of whether strong corporate earnings can keep underpinning stock values.
Industry analysts said Intel's quarterly price cuts on Pentium processors are expected to lead to slightly lower prices for personal computers. Some speculated that in expectation of rival chips, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s new K6, Intel will cut Pentium prices more than usual, from 25 percent to 30 percent.
""This continues to fuel normal PC demand,"" said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc in San Jose, Calif. ""This is the normal stuff that keeps stimulating the market.""
According to First Call, which tracks Wall Street estimates, analysts expect Intel to report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 a share, up from $1.02 a year ago, when Intel posted net income of $894 million on revenues of $4.64 billion.
If Intel meets those expectations, it will be the second straight quarter in which the world's largest maker of computer chips has more than doubled its year-on-year profits.
An Intel spokesman said the company could not comment this close to its earnings report, but the company said in mid-March -- within two weeks of the close of the quarter -- that market fundamentals ""remain very strong.""
Intel executives told analysts in January they expect revenues to be around $6.4 billion, about even with what it reported in the fourth quarter. Gross margins -- the difference between revenue and the costs of goods -- are expected to be even with or below the fourth quarter's 63 percent.
Analysts said Intel's bellwether role -- it has recently made a habit of re-energizing flagging stock markets with particularly upbeat earnings reports -- is especially crucial given Wall Street's current moodiness.
Wall Street is particularly wary of the outlook for corporate earnings following the Federal Reserve's March 25 decision to raise interest rates and fresh speculation about chances of another rate increase based on Friday's report of underlying price pressures at the wholesale level in March.
""People are scared. Intel is one of the biggest holdings and they can still sell it at a profit,"" said David Wu, high-tech analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. ""They're scared because tech stocks are going down. If technology stocks can't do corporate earnings, you can forget about the rest.
Analysts said the much-heralded ""whisper"" number for Intel is for it to make $2.15 a share, and that even $2.20 a share could be possible given another blow-out quarter.
But, one analyst cautioned, ""anything less than $2.15 would not be good"" for the market.
Market researcher Dataquest said last week that Intel will continue to dominate the personal computer industry, where its processors currently account for 95 percent of the market, although clone-makers will start to make inroads this year.
Intel spokesman Howard High said Friday the company will continue with its routine quarterly pricing changes, but that he saw no unusual changes in the upcoming pricing pattern from that to which the PC industry has grown accustomed.
""We do our price declines in a pretty predictable, orderly fashion,"" he said.
Analysts expect Intel to cut some prices when it unveils its new high-end Pentium II chip next month, and High said Intel's practice is to ""move other products down a notch"" to make room for the new processors.
""The movement is always in a relatively consistent direction, which is down. The rate is dependent on market conditions ... They (the pricing reductions) seem to have been pretty constant over the years,"" he added.
In February, Intel's pricing changes for its Pentium and Pentium Pro family of microprocessors ranged from no change at all to roughly a 34 percent decline, he noted.
Intel's processors range in price from around $100 for the lower-end, older models to over $1,000 for the highest-end chips.

SamuelPerry,"Apple Computer Inc. is seeking outside investment in its Newton computer unit and is looking for new homes for at least a dozen technology projects it recently decided to stop funding, the struggling computer maker's chief scientist said.
The unit responsible for the hand-held Newton computer was spared the axe in a restructuring last month despite speculation it would be closed.
Early versions of the highly touted Newton did not make the grade four years ago, but Apple Chief Scientist Larry Tesler said in an interview late Thursday that the unit's latest offerings have been getting rave reviews.
Demand for its new eMate, a version of the Newton in a stylish clamshell case with a keyboard for schoolchildren and costing around $800, is particularly strong, Tesler said.
A small group of Apple executives has been assigned to explore alternatives for increasing investment in the Newton business while Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple slashes spending elsewhere in a bid to return to profitability, he said.
Tesler declined to talk about individual companies which Apple may have approached and said he is not directly involved in the group's day-to-day efforts, but said the executives had entered the process with ""an open mind.""
The group was prepared to consider a broad set of options, he said, although he would not say specifically whether these could include a joint venture or some sort of manufacturing or distribution deal, for example.
""We are pleased by the reception for the eMate and looking at how we can increase our investment in it at the same time as we lower expenses of the company,"" he said.
Apple's lead scientist said talk of scaling back or exiting the Newton business, which made Apple a pioneer in the hand-held computer market despite its bumpy start, was off target at a time when ""it's just hitting its stride.""
In mid-March, Apple set out to cut spending by an average of 25 percent across the company while abandoning support for an array of technologies in its research labs.
Apple has said it would cut 4,100 jobs and take a $155 million restructuring charge in the second quarter ending March 31. Apple is due to report second-quarter results April 16.
Tesler said Apple was looking for ways to keep its discontinued work alive by licensing it, for example, to third parties ""so these technologies can come to market.""
""They're not ones that fit our business model, but they're ones that we think are good and ought to come to market,"" he said. ""We have one or two dozen technologies that Apple has decided to discontinue and (it is seeking to farm them out) rather than seeing them wither.""
Tesler declined to give details on what the technologies were, other than the outline given last month in the company's restructuring announcement. He said the method of seeking new sponsors to further develop and market the technologies would differ according to each.
Tesler was attending the Sixth International World Wide Web Conference in Santa Clara, Calif., where he made a presentation to a packed room on some of the newest technology for use in Apple systems.

Tesler was attending the Sixth International World Wide Web Conference in Santa Clara, where he gave a presentation to a crowded audience on some of the hottest new Internet technology for use on Apple systems.
Speculation that Apple might part with its Newton division re-emerged on Thursday after USA Today reported Apple was in talks with Sun Microsystems Inc. over the possibility Sun might buy the Newton unit.
The newspaper reported Sun could be a tough bargainer and said no deal was imminent. Neither Tesler, Apple nor a spokesman for Sun Microsystems would comment on the report. Sun said it does not comment on speculation.
Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy said last week he would not comment on acquisition rumors, including those about Apple. He said that in general Sun will remain ""opportunistic"" in evaluating any deals that come its way.
Earlier this year Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. (ARM), which makes the speedy processors used in the Newton eMate and Apple's recently launched MessagePad 2000, said ARM was working with Sun's Javasoft unit to make an operating system based on Java technology run on the ARM platform.

SamuelPerry,"USWeb Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Joe Firmage on Monday said the fast-growing Internet services company had launched the second stage of its business plan, agreeing to acquire affiliates in six U.S. metropolitan areas.
Firmage, who started the Santa Clara-based company just 13 months ago, said the second phase of the plan called for the expansion of its corporate-owned operations. He said USWeb would also expand outside the United States, particularly in Southeast Asia and Japan, by the end of October.  
Next year, USWeb will concentrate on profitability, he said. ""In January 1998 the focus is on leveraging what we built,"" Firmage said in an interview in Palo Alto.
He said the company was seeking to achieve economies of scale in the market for services related to building Internet sites and intranets -- internal corporate computer networks that take advantage of inexpensive Internet technologies.
Firmage said USWeb in its first phase succeeded in building a string of franchises in 54 locations in 26 states, including recent affiliates in Austin, Texas., Seattle, Pittsburgh, and Irving and Laguna Hills, Calif.  
The chief executive said USWeb had also succeeded in building a strong name and thus a currency for expansion. A recent study rated USWeb third among information technology executives for brand awareness, behind AT&amp;T Corp and MCI Communications Corp, he said.
Firmage said the company was close to arranging a second round of financing. Last year, USWeb raised $17 million from Softbank Corp of Japan and Crosspoint Ventures, which valued USWeb at $31 million, he said.  
Firmage declined to project the size of any new investment.
By next year, the company's expansion should help USWeb become ""broad and deep and profitable,"" he said, declining to elaborate on expected profit margins.
Firmage said more than 50 percent of USWeb's business was ""the $50,000 to $1 million range of companies setting up business-critical sites for department-sized operations.  
That work, and even much of the business of setting up enterprise-wide sites ranging in value from $500,000 to $3.0 million, is below the horizon of some of the bigger high-technology consulting firms, he added.
Firmage said Internet technologies accounted for an increasing share of the $20 billion information technology out-sourcing market.
The affiliates that USWeb is acquiring are in Washington, San Francisco, the New York City area, Orange County, Calif., Philadelphia, and Milwaukee.
Firmage declined to discuss when or whether the company may consider an initial public stock offering. But, he said, with the current moribund IPO market and declining share prices, ""the private market is the place to be right now.""
Meanwhile, acquisition offers the owners of its franchises a way of creating some liquidity in their holdings, he said.
""There's no question that this does open the possibility of liquidity,"" he said. ""We have a liquidity path.""
USWeb's operations now encompass some 400 to 500 people. The company will hold its semiannual affiliate meeting, known as Velocity, in San Francisco next week.

SamuelPerry,"The legal barrage by Netscape Communications Corp. against arch-rival Microsoft Corp. may end up dampening investors' enthusiasm for both stocks, analysts said on Wednesday.
Gary Reback, Netscape's outside counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, has urged the Department of Justice to take immediate action against Microsoft for alleged violations of its 1994 consent decree and antitrust laws.
Separately, Tim O'Reilly, head of Internet publisher O'Reilly &amp; Associates, said he was recently approached by a Justice Department official asking about Microsoft's behaviour, perhaps indicating fresh interest in the matter.
Microsoft, which has weathered legal battles successfully in the past, has rebuffed the allegations, saying Netscape's claims are ""full of wild and unsubstantiated statements.""
The software giant went on the offensive Wednesday, accusing Netscape of failing to live up to its own promises that it would support open Internet standards.
""Netscape should take a good look at themselves in the mirror,"" said Brad Chase, vice president or marketing for Microsoft's Internet division, noting Netscape had blocked users of Microsoft's browser from parts of the Netscape site.
Nevertheless, analysts noted the market has a distaste for legal uncertainty, and investors were likely to start factoring in at least some degree of risk that the battle could escalate into a full-fledged government investigation or lawsuit.
""The legal risk is starting to get heightened on this,"" said Montgomery Securities analyst David Readerman, who covered Microsoft during Apple Computer Inc.'s failed five-year copyright lawsuit against the software giant.
Microsoft also was probed by the Federal Trade Commission and, subsequently, the Justice Department for five years until its July 1994 signing of a consent decree agreeing to alter the way it licenses operating system software.
That accord was viewed by some of its software rivals as having been lenient, and Netscape's lawyer asked the Justice Department in a letter released Tuesday to examine whether Microsoft was now using its control over computer operating systems improperly.
In both cases, analysts noted that the hint of further legal difficulties could dampen further advances in the companies' stocks as the market seeks to sort out the business impact, if any.
""We've been there with the Apple vs Microsoft and we've been there with the (Justice Department) and the experience is that these stocks tend to stall as the market tries to figure out what the risk is all about,"" said Readerman.
Microsoft stock closed up 12.5 cents at $123.50, while Netscape was unchanged at $37.25, both on Nasdaq.
Lawyers in Washington, D.C., said they doubt the Justice Department would find Microsoft had acted improperly, based on the charges leveled against the company by Netscape.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape alleged through its letter to the DOJ that Microsoft had offered ""clandestine side payments"" and discounts on its operating system, and other inducements, to promote use of its own Internet browser.
The lawyers contacted by Reuters noted that while Microsoft dominates the PC operating system market with around a 90 percent share, Netscape has an estimated 80 percent share of the market for Internet browser software.
""In the browser category, Netscape is the elephant and Microsoft is the mouse,"" said Robert Skitol of Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath. ""It's a bit of a stretch to call what Microsoft is described as doing a violation of the consent decree or a violation of antitrust laws.""

SamuelPerry,"@Home Network CEO Tom Jermoluk said the $48 million raised by the high-speed Internet service group allows it to be selective in the timing of an eventual initial public offering (IPO).
""We're not out seeking other forms of capital,"" Jermoluk said after the company announced the private placement in preferred stock, accounting for about 4.5 percent of the company and valuing it at a whopping $1.07 billion, nearly 20 times its initial value in 1995.
""We are a company that has been designed from the beginning to be one that does eventually go to the public market,"" he added, declining to discuss any specific schedule for when it might go public.
""The nice thing about now having raised this cash is we're flexible,"" he told Reuters in an interview after the funding announcement. ""Whenever the market and the company conditions are right together, then we'll be able to go.""
Despite the hefty valuation for @Home - more than double the $425 million Microsoft Corp agreed to pay for fledgling startup WebTV in its mostly stock deal last week -- @Home is heavily dependent on its partners to build out their cable networks to accommodate @Home.
While WebTV has sought to gear its network to deliver Internet content at slow speeds over ordinary phone lines to a television set-top box of its design, @Home is aiming to provide speedy, high-bandwidth service from the start.
Technically, it can offer service at speeds more than 30 times faster than the currently-deployed dialup modems, but its seven cable operator partners will have to spend heavily upgrade their systems to accommodate @Home.
""Certainly hundreds of millions of dollars (are) required to upgrade all of their systems,"" he said.
For example, taking @Home partners' current rights to supply cable to some 45 million homes in North America, Jermoluk said $50 dollars a home would be a conservative investment requirement. This would be roughly $2.25 billion if every home were actually to be hooked up.
""That's a lot of dough over the next five or six years of doing upgrades,"" said Jermoluk, who estimated it would take that long ""to get a majority of those homes.""
@Home has already begun residential deployment in more than half a dozen citites, with each of its three primary investment partners.
@Home's partners are not required to roll out an Internet service, but if they do, they have agreed it will be the @Home service. As a hedge, @Home has started a trial of Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) for use eventually by customers outside its partner's regions.
""In the areas where we don't have cable we ourselves will go in with an ADSL type of approach,"" he said, adding he will deploy ADSL selectively this year although he felt it is two years behind cable and modem prices are high.
@Home, which is available for $35-$40 a month in a handful of areas, is also leading an @Work business for telecommuters and other business users priced around $150 a month for a direct link to an office machine.
Jermoluk said the commercial business will potentially become half of its revenue.
""It's a very attractive market,"" he said.
@Home Network is also looking to expand outside North America, Jermoluk said.
""We've been in talks with a number of different countries,"" he added. ""I think the obvious targets are the big ones, like Japan, UK, Germany - the heavy population centers."" (sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400)

SamuelPerry,"Netscape Communications Corp.'s lead antitrust lawyer has written the Justice Department urging it to take immediate action against Microsoft Corp. for what he characterised as ""far-reaching, anti-competitive behaviour.""
The letter demanding ""immediate attention"" was dated Aug. 12 and made available to Reuters Tuesday. It represents a further escalation of a battle of words between the rival companies that began earlier this month as they prepared to issue new versions of Internet browser software.
Gary Reback, the outside attorney representing Netscape, also suggested in the letter to Deputy Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein that the issue be turned over to the Federal Trade Commission for further investigation.
The eight-page letter accused Microsoft of having made written offers to computer makers, Internet service providers, large corporations and others providing for ""either clandestine side payments, discounts on the Microsoft desktop operating system (Windows) or payments in the form of 'real estate' on the Windows 95 (opening) screen.""
Reback says these inducements were made on condition that the parties involved would ""make competitors' browsers far less accessible to users than Microsoft's own browser."" A browser enables computer users to access the Internet's World Wide Web.
The letter said Netscape had ""uncovered numerous additional steps that Microsoft has taken for the purpose of eliminating competition in the Internet software markets,"" including predatory pricing and bundling of products.
Microsoft spokeswoman Claire Lematta dismissed the letter, saying it ""appears to be full of wild and unsubstantiated statements.""
""It looks to us like a marketing document masquerading as a legal document,"" she said. ""Netscape must be feeling the competitive pressure.""
The legal clash comes at a critical point as both Netscape and the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant introduce new versions of their respective browsers, Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape, an early leader in browser technology, holds the lead in market share with an estimated 80 percent or more of the worldwide market.
But Microsoft, whose Windows systems are found in about 90 percent of personal computers, has moved quickly to gain an estimated 10 percent of the browser market and says more than 1 million people have downloaded its latest browser ,version.
That software, Internet Explorer 3.0, was formally introduced just a week ago. On Monday, Netscape launched the latest version of its browser, Navigator 3.0
Both companies have linked up with content providers to offer free trial subscriptions as a way of promoting their browsers. Analysts have said that Microsoft, which has thrown its marketing and financial clout into Internet products, has leveled the playing field with its latest software.
Microsoft and Netscape are also already well along the way to developing the next versions of their browsers.
Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer known for spearheading past legal tussles with Microsoft, said the alleged practices went far beyond those which had been addressed in a consent decree reached by Microsoft and the Justice Department just two years ago.
""Microsoft's behaviour is, if anything, more anti-competitive and pernicious than the conduct addressed specifically in the decree,"" Reback wrote in the letter.

SamuelPerry,"Intel Corp. will extend its reach into the networking equipment market Monday by launching two aggressively priced products aimed at speeding the use of increasingly powerful computers.
Intel's Hillsboro, Ore.-based Internet and Communications Group (ICG) said it is introducing a networking hub to allow customers to move gradually from 10 megabits per second (Mbps) to 100 Mbps speeds.
The Intel Express 10/100 Stackable Hub will be priced at $99 a port in some configurations -- a price it said was very competitive with traditional 100 Mbps hubs at $150 to $175 a port and the slower 10 Mbps hubs at $70 a port.
It can be stacked up to eight units high, allowing for denser packing of networking equipment than rival's hubs.
Intel is also launching the industry's first single chip Fast Ethernet product -- dubbed the Intel 82558 -- to support networking at speeds of 10 or 100 Mbps.
""We want to make network connectivity a standard part of every PC shipped,"" said ICG vice president Mark Christensen, adding that the chip reduces the cost of building Fast Ethernet networking into PCs by about 50 percent.
The chip can be shipped directly on a personal computer's motherboard. Of the roughly 40 million new Ethernet-ready PCs shipped each year, less than 10 percent are done with motherboard implementations and Christensen said this could approach 30 to 40 percent of PCs.
The new chip will also improve manageability features, such as remote management of the PCs over a network to simplify maintenance and upgrades. Limited samples of the 82558 are now available for manufacturers, Intel said.
The move is Intel's second bold thrust this year in the fast-paced market dominated by Cisco Systems, 3Com Corp., and Bay Networks Inc..
In February Intel dropped its prices nearly 40 percent on Fast Ethernet network adapters - devices which can be installed in a computer to enable them to communicate in a network at higher speeds -- a strike most directly at 3Com.
""3Com responded very quickly,"" Dataquest analyst John Armstrong said of Intel's February price drop, ""When they modified their adapter pricing they really rocked 3Com.""
""I don't think this announcement is at the same level,"" in terms of its direct impact on the current players, Armstrong said of Monday's introductions.
Nevertheless, Armstrong said Intel's aggressive price points could be a significant factor in accomplishing Intel's objective of boosting use of the technology.
""The fact they have 10/100 isn't innovative - the price point is. It will reduce the indecision level,"" he added. ""Because Intel is coming up a bit later, they have to do things that make people stand up and notice.""
3Com is the leader in 100-megabit hubs, based on 1996 data, with its share on some products in the category up to the high 30 percent range. Bay Networks and Hewlett- Packard Co. are also strong in the market.
In the adapter market, analysts noted that 3Com has also provided advanced capabilities like the sort of network management features Intel is now making it possible to place directly on the PC motherboard.
""3Com is trying to outflank Cisco by coming at them from the desktop and in a way Intel is doing the same thing,"" Armstrong. 3Com has been facing greater pressure from both Intel and from Cisco, however.
Just last week, 3Com said in its quarterly report that it could see slower revenue increases than the rest of the networking industry because of falling prices and weaker overall demand for networking gear.
The stock of 3Com has fallen sharply from the low $70 range early this year to below $30 last week. It closed down $2.75 on Friday at $29.25 on the Nasdaq market.
""Intel is certainly a contender now,"" in networking, said Armstrong, noting that in the networking hub market, for example, they were not in the top 10 industry players in 1996 but they could burst up the charts this year.
""They have indicated they certainly are not stopping with these most recent product announcements,"" he said.
Intel said it was able to support the aggressive price levels due to its expertise in silicon design and fabrication and its volume manufacturing capabilities.
The company, the world's largest semiconductor maker, said its drive into networking, like many of its other recent industry initiatives, is aimed at selling more high powered personal computers that use its microprocessors.

SamuelPerry,"Hewlett-Packard Co., seeking to forge rapidly into the fast-growing area of electronic commerce, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire VeriFone Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.18 billion.
Hewlett-Packard said VeriFone, a leader in electronic payment hardware and software, will be operated as an independent unit of HP. Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said.
Forrester Research estimates the market for business to business electronic commerce will jump from $600 million last year to $66 billion in the year 2000, with consumer retail business rising to $7 billion from $530 million in 1996.
""When you talk about online commerce today, invariably you're talking about online payment. VeriFone is going to be the diamond in the crown in this area for some time to come,"" said Forrester Research analyst Karen Epper.
HP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.
The acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. HP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.
Verifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75, also in heavy trading on the NYSE.
JP Morgan analyst Daniel Kunstler said the deal provides HP with some ""lynchpin technologies"" for electronic commerce, and although it will be slightly dilutive to HP's current fiscal year earnings, the impact should be less than one percent.
Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and using ""smart-card"" products for the home.
Smart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information.
Just last week, Citicorp's Citibank said it will launch a pilot programme with VeriFone to test smart card use that will allow selected customers to download funds onto smart cards using its devices in their home or office.
VeriFone estimates that its systems handled more than $520 billion of the $800 billion in electronic transactions conducted in the United States last year.
The acquisition is a further step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the ""on-ramps"" and ""off-ramps"" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where HP is a dominant player already.
HP said the two companies' technologies complement each other, with HP's focus on Internet security technologies and major corporate markets, including its broad distribution channels, melding with VeriFone's expertise in moving money.
""Central to HP's strategy to achieve this vision is the ability to move money securely from end to end over the Internet, an area VeriFone has pioneered through products and strategic relationships,"" HP Executive Vice President Rick Belluzzo said.
The companies' relationship includes providing products for the Visa/MasterCard Secure Electronic Transaction protocol, which is being rolled out this year, for secure credit-card payments over the Internet.
Analysts noted that other firms, many of them fledgeling startups like Cybercash, in which VeriFone holds a 10 percent stake, are also competing in what they expect will be an explosive market for electronic commerce systems and services.

SamuelPerry,"Hewlett-Packard Co., seeking to extend its position as a leader in electronic commerce, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire VeriFone Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.18 billion.
Hewlett-Packard said VeriFone, a leader in electronic payment hardware and software, will be operated as an independent unit of HP. Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said.
The acquisition is a big step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the ""on-ramps"" and ""off-ramps"" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where Hewlett-Packard already has a dominant market share.
In an intervew last week the company's top Internet executive, Ira Goldstein, said Hewlett-Packard aimed to become the information appliance supplier to the fast-growing market for Internet technology.
The Internet portion of the electronic commerce market alone is expected to reach $95 billion in the United States by the year 2000, according to research by International Data Corp.
HP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.
The acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. As of Monday, VeriFone had 23.3 million shares of common stock outstanding, the companies said.
HP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.
Verifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75 in very heavy trading on the NYSE, after initially being halted, as investors priced in the value of the stock swap.
Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and ""smart-card"" products for homes.
Smart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information.

Forrester Research estimates the market for business to business electronic commerce will jump from $600 million last year to $66 billion in the year 2000, with consumer retail business rising to $7 billion from $530 million in 1996.
""When you talk about online commerce today, invariably you're talking about online payment. VeriFone is going to be the diamond in the crown in this area for some time to come,"" said Forrester Research analyst Karen Epper.

SamuelPerry,"Internet software company Netscape Communications Corp. Wednesday reported a 119 percent surge in first-quarter profits to $7.9 million, boosted by new business on its Web site and corporate sales growth.
Chief Executive Officer Jim Barksdale said in a statement the company's server -- or network host computer software -- business continued to grow, accounting for roughly 38 percent of the company's revenues for the quarter.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape's earnings, equal to 9 cents a share, compared with $3.6 million, or 4 cents a share in the first quarter of 1996.
Revenues totalled $120.2 million, a 114 percent increase over the $56.1 million in revenues generated a year ago. Industry analysts on average had expected Netscape to post earnings of 8 cents a share.
Netscape reported growth in revenues from new businesses that will attract viewers to its Web site for informaiton as well as products, including a deal with Yahoo! Inc. to provide an Internet information navigation service.
That deal was among the factors that helped boost services to 25 percent of revenues from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Currie said services and the Web site were important financial contributors.
The earnings were released after the market close.
Netscape shares had traded at less than a third of their 52-week intraday peak of $75.25 during Wednesday's session, but rallied to close up $2.50 at $27.50 in Nasdaq trade.
The stock remained steady in after-hours trade, trading in a band of $27.375 to $27.625.
"
SamuelPerry,"Netscape Communications Corp's first quarter results were better than Wall Street's most gloomy projections despite investor worries about sweeping product upgrades next month, analysts said.
Not only did the company manage revenues of $120.2 million in the quarter to March 31, essentially matching more upbeat estimates, but the Internet software pioneer topped analysts' $0.08 a share mean estimate by a penny.
Analysts said company executives appeared confident they will be able to introduce a broad upgrade of its new software within the current second quarter, allaying some concerns the date could slide.
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale told analysts and media by teleconference that the company will hold its third developers' conference in San Jose on June 11-13 and analysts said it will likely ship final versions of its Communicator and SuiteSpot upgrades before then.
""Relative to what was being presumed for the quarter this should be a sigh of relief for a lot of folks out there,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Parekh. ""There was no bogeyman under the bed, as some folks had feared.""
The company told analysts and reporters after the earnings report that sales of its ""client"" browser products as a portion of total revenue declined to 38 percent from 51 percent in the final 1996 quarter.
Server software accounted for 37 percent of total revenue, up from 33 percent in the December quarter, while services soared to $25 percent of revenue from 16 percent.
Compared to a year ago, when analysts noted the company had essentially four products, Barksdale said a total of 15 products had been introduced, upgraded or entered beta testing since January 1.
""We continue to think the market opportunity is significant, and we feel terrific about our product line, particularly our new releases which are in final beta cycles today and which will be released commercially this quarter,"" Barksdale said.
Some analysts expressed surprise at the growth in services revenue, which included greater emphasis on content reachable from its Web site and a fresh focus on growing Netscape's service offerings on their own.
""In my mind it's absolutely a positive, given that they are competing with a software company that is also on its way to becoming a content company,"" said Parekh, referring to Microsoft Corp's media initiatives.
The company was also at the tail end of its Navigator cycle, ahead of the introduction of Communicator, with one analyst saying retail browser revenues fell to two percent from seven percent in the December quarter.
But Netscape retains its share of doubters.
Zona Research said in a report after the results that a dip in overall margins might be a one-time event, but it was nonetheless ""a warning that cannot be taken lightly.""
""Although we believe jackrabbit growth rates are not infinitely sustainable, there is an ominous statistic in today's announcement,"" it said of the margin levels.
On Tuesday, brokers Volpe Brown Whelan &amp; Co. said that though Netscape might report ""a perfectly respectable"" first quarter result on Wednesday, it was entering a period of significantly greater stakes and higher risk.
Two analysts at the firm, Charles Finnie and David Locke, initiated coverage of Netscape with its lowest investment rate, an underperform, setting a 12-month price target of $21 based on comparable valuations.
Netscape faces more substantial risks in the next 18 months than earlier in its short history, the analysts said in a research report, in addition to having drawn ""the unwelcome, and undivided, attention of Microsoft."" ((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))

SamuelPerry,"NEC Corp's NEC Computer Systems unit will on Monday launch a set of personal computers aimed at what it sees as a huge North American market of businesses with fewer than half a dozen employees.
The computers, which will include the first customized for this market to include Intel Corp Pentium Pro processors and a special software bundle from Microsoft Corp, are aimed at the needs of small businesses.  
They include APC uninterruptible power supplies,  Iomega Corp Zip drives for storing onto 100 megabyte floppy disks, NEC Multispin 8X CD-ROM drives, telephone headsets with built-in microphones and stereo speakers.
The four ""Ready Office"" models range in price from $2,199 to $2,999 and include processors ranging from the 133- or 166- megahertz Pentium to Intel's 180-megahertz Pentium Pro.
The target market, which NEC calls the ""Tiny Office/Home Office"" (TOHO) segment, is a subset of the Small Office/Home Office market targeted by many computer makers and includes a vast array of professionals and service businesses.  
According to IDC/LINK data, NEC said, this group accounts for around 56 percent of the businesses with fewer than 100 employees in the United States, referred to in the computer industry as the SOHO, or Small Office/Home Office, market.
Furthermore, NEC said in a white paper, the group will purchase 2.23 million computer units in 1996, or some 40 percent of all units sold into the SOHO market.
Accountants, florists, doctors, graphic designers, real estate agents, writers, restaurants and travel agents are among the businesses NEC aims to address.  
NEC's research found these one to five person businesses generally lack the corporate infrastructure found in larger operations, so often one personal computer-level machine must carry the weight of all the organization's activities.
""TOHO business owners require computing solutions that will not only auotomate business processes, but assist them in managing the business as well,"" Timothy Chin, NEC Computer Systems senior product manager, wrote in a market report.  
""TOHO business owners need computing solutions that will help them to better wear each of their several hats, including those of president, chief financial officer, marketing professinal, MIS technician, business or legal advisory, even secretary,"" he said.
""In TOHO companies, the computer is the busineess -- without it core activities would come to a screeching halt.""  
Steffanee White, a product manager at NEC Computer Systems here, said in an interview that NEC had taken a ""bottom-up"" approach to designing its products for the TOHO market, stripping out unnecessary features like high-end audio and graphics or computer games and children's educational titles.
Through a partnership with Microsoft, NEC said it will be the first to include on its machine the combination of Windows 95 with a business software suite incorporating Word, Excel and Publisher 97 and special Excel and Word templates.  
The computers are also fitted with Peachtree First Accounting, Microsoft Schedule+, Money, Bookshelf and Automap Streets, in addition to voicemail, fax, e-mail and Novell Inc network certification, the company said.
For the reseller channel, the company will ship four roughly equivalent PowerMate Office models ranging in price from $2,100 to $3,200, with the high-end PowerMate Office Pro 2620 running the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 operating system.
NEC said the products will be available by mid-October.
System prices do not include monitors, it said.

SamuelPerry,"Hewlett-Packard Co. Monday will raise the stakes in the fiercely-competitive and fast growing market for computer servers by launching new models that are more than double the speed of their predecessors.
The new HP 9000 line of servers, the machines at the heart of computer networks including the Internet, are based on H-P's latest PA-RISC 8000 microprocessor. The company claims that they easily outperform those of its rivals.
The widely-watch launch will put pressure on archrivals Sun Microsystems as well as competitors like International Business Machines Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc., and Digital Equipment Corp.
The introduction, which follows a sluggish transition to speedy PA-8000-based workstations in June, will give a boost to Hewlett-Packard at a time of ferocious growth in the market.
""It's growing in the 50-plus range a year,"" Carol Mills, worldwide general manager for HP's multibillion dollar Unix server business, said in an interview.
""The Internet is hot,"" she said, but added that new applications such as data warehousing -- enabling access to vast data storage facilities -- and using servers as an alternatives to mainframes are also key market opportunities.
Mills, who said the current shift to Internet-based technology presents ""not just a window of opportunity but the sliding glass door,"" estimates that the new markets alone will generate many billions of computer hardware revenue dollars.
HP's three new server lines complete its transition to 64-bit microprocessors for Unix machines, and the company is due to deliver a 64-bit HP-UX Unix operating system next year.
At the core of its new offering are four models its mid-range K-Class family, available immediately and ranging in starting price from $52,200 to $77,200.
H-P said the HP 9000 K-Class models -- described as the ""sweet spot"" in its lineup -- are designed for symmetric multiprocessing and can accomodate one to four PA-8000 chips.
The company said the highest performing K460 model had 85 percent better performance that Sun's Ultra Enterprise 3000, while outperforming Digital's 4100 5/400 by 65 percent and had twice the performance of IBM's RS/6000 J40.
H-P also said a new high-end HP 9000 server, the T-Class Model T600 with symetrical multiprocessing as a mainframe alternative for such tasks as on-line transaction processing, will be available in the second calendar quarter of 1997.
HP said it will also begin shipping two new models in its entry-level HP-9000 D-class in October. The D270, starting at $22,260 and the D370, priced at $25,250, are designed for worgroups and departments and for sale by resellers.
As a sign of the fierce pace of product advances in the market, analysts noted the new models more than double the performance of machines updated as recently as February 1996 for the K-Class and January of this yer for the C-Class.
Jean Bozman, an analyst at International Data Corp. said the updated HP 9000 models is ""a strong offering"" which would be a boost for existing customers and make it ""highly competitive"" with fast-charging Sun in the duel for number one.
IDC's 1995 statistics show Hewlett-Packard had the lead in worldwide revenues from small- and medium-size servers at $3.4 billion, with Sun selling more than $1.8 billion worth.
Across all Unix systems, according to IDC, H-P had server and workstation revenues totalling $6.1 billion, compared with $5.6 billion for Sun Microsystems, which due to lower system cost had the overall lead on a unit shipment basis.
The approaching H-P launch prompted a preemptive strike from officials at Sun Microsystems, which closed its fiscal year-ending June quarter with record-level backlogs due to soaring orders for the Ultra machines it introduced in April.
""This is just a chip upgrade for a system they've had a long time,"" Anil Gadre, vice president of corporate marketing at Sun Microsystems, said of H-P's launch, dismissing the high performance ratings of what he termed ""a late life kicker.""
""We could not be in a better position to compete with them and position ourselves to take share away from them,"" he said.

SamuelPerry,"General Magic Inc. Monday demonstrated components of a new service that will let people use phones, pagers and the Internet itself to keep track of schedules, electronic mail, voice mail and telephone call processing.
The service, code-named Serengeti will allow mobile workers to check and respond to electronic mail and scheduling details from the road using voice commands.
The system may compete with voicemail providers like Octel Communications Inc. and Siemens' Rolm systems, as well as electronic mail readers which small startups are developing, but it appears to be the first which integrates all these components into one service.
For example, users can check their schedules by computer or cellular telephone, while also checking voice mail and electronic mail, and using everyday English to communicate with with the service.
The service will be accessible from most devices, including desktop PCs as well as via telephones and pagers.
General Magic Chairman Steve Markman said in an interview at the Upside/David Coursey Internet Showcase here that a pilot version of the service will enter testing in May and it could generate revenues later in 1997.
""Our focus is to make sure we've got the service right,"" said Markman, who unveiled the company's new business plan earlier this year and repeated that General Magic does not expect to make significant revenues from it until mid-1998.
Executives declined to discuss pricing or distribution of the product, but said it would be available to individual mobile workers. Kevin Surace, who headed the Serengeti project, said it would cost less than ""hundreds of dollars.""
General Magic also announced a joint technology accord with Starfish Software, Inc., which was founded in 1994 by technologists including former Borland Inc. head Philippe Kahn to develop products focused on the Internet, wireless communications and computer telephony.
Under the Starfish agreement, the two companies will work together to integrate Starfish's technology based on the Java programming language into General Magic's Serengeti service.

SamuelPerry,"Intuit Inc. said Monday it would swap its Intuit Services Corp. bill payment and bank services unit to CheckFree Corp. for $260 million worth of CheckFree stock.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Intuit, which pioneered personal and small business financial software, also launched a far-reaching initiative to accelerate adpotion of electronic financial data exchange and commmunications over the Internet.
Wall Street applauded Intuit's decision to trade its private network bank services business, which it acquired in 1994, for 12.6 million shares of CheckFree common stock. On the Nasdaq, Intuit rose $2.125 to $32.25 while Columbus, Ohio-based CheckFree gained $3.19 to $21.25.
Lehman Brothers analyst Michael Stanek said he believed Intuit had received ""an excellent price"" from CheckFree.
""By selling Intuit Services Corp., we believe that investors will breathe a sigh of relief as Intuit has decided to exit the transaction processing business and will begin to focus efforts on its front-end software products,"" he said.
Scott Cook, Intuit's co-founder and chairman, said in a statement that the original investment two years ago had enabled Intuit to provide a secure private network connection between customers and financial service providers.
But now, he said, rapid advances in the safety and reliability of the Internet have made it the central focus of Intuit's strategy.
""Our goal is to speed the adoption of electronic connections between individuals, small businesses and financial service providers,"" he said.
Intuit produces TurboTax, the best-selling tax preparation software; and QuickBooks, the most popular small business accounting software. Its Quicken program is the leading personal finance software.
Intuit, which has 12 million personal finance customers -- both individuals and small businesses -- said it would facilitate the growth of links across the Internet by coordinating an industry framework for electronic data exchange dubbed OpenExchange.
Intuit said it planned to put Internet connections into place for online investment next spring, with online banking and bill payment activities in the fall of next year.
CheckFree said its acquisition would expand its home banking and bill payment services to more than 180 financial institutions and more than 1 million customers.
CheckFree Chairman Pete Kight said he expected all major banking institutions to begin establishing electronic transaction capabilities within the next 12 months.
CheckFree said its open set-up enables financial institutions to offer home banking and payment using personal computers, touch-tone phones and the Internet.
The swap occurs as use of the Internet for online financial transactions, rather than private networks, shows signs of taking off after a period of modest penetration.
David Weisman, an analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting firm Forrester Research Inc., said the number of U.S. households doing online banking is expected to grow to 9.1 million by the year 2001 from 1.1 million today.
Intuit Service accounted for less than 3 percent of Intuit's revenues in fiscal 1996. Intuit said it was selling about 2 million CheckFree shares acquired in the transaction, which Kight said brings its holdings below 20 percent.
Separately, Intuit said its losses widened to $22 million, or 48 cents a share, in its fourth fiscal quarter ended July 31 from $1.4 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 26 percent to $91.1 million from $72.4 million.
The results include an $8 million acquisition charge, higher spending in customer service and technical support, and bill payment processing startup expenses at Intuit Services.
Cook said Intuit must invest in research and development and marketing to address the Internet, which is growing faster than first anticipated, and he expected lower revenue growth and a modest increase in operating margins in fiscal 1997.
""We will continue to run our business focusing on long-term results, not quarterly results,"" he said.
"
SamuelPerry,"Internet start-up companies continue to plunge into a fiercely competitive, still-embryonic market -- but major investors expect an equally fast shake-out in the next few months.
Internet security, Internet-based telephone service and Web publishing were among the vibrant but increasingly crowded sectors for new products and services from more than 60 companies demonstrating their wares at an industry conference in San Diego.
""There are a lot of things here that are products, not companies,"" said Thomas Winter, general partner at Onset Ventures in Austin, Texas, after viewing demonstrations at the three-day Upside/David Coursey Internet Showcase.
What separates the Internet market from previous start-up investment booms like personal computers and biotechnology, venture capitalists say, is the potential market opportunity is expected to be far broader.
John Doerr, the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers venture capital guru often hailed as someone who starts whole industries rather than just companies, calculates the Internet venture market is taking off at three times the velocity of the PC industry 15 years ago.
Yet the speed also means sectors of the Internet industry have gone through consolidation phases far more rapidly than more mature industries.
Just a year ago, four Internet search and navigation companies were hitting the public market. But, shortly after that, merger activity began swiftly for other, non-public navigation services.
Some industry executives and venture investors are already seeing a similar phenomenon in other areas. With the cool state of the market for initial public offerings, many companies are expected to seek corporate investment or buyouts.
Many have shifted their business plans to the corporate market in an effort to win corporate information technology dollars. Partly, this is also due to a view that public Internet access will not speed up any time soon.
""There's no panacea in the bandwidth area,"" said Intel Corp. executive Victor Varney, using the industry term for the speed of an Internet connection. Varney noted that an independent survey projects that by the year 2000 fewer than 20 percent of individuals will have speedier connections than a common phone line.
One example of overcrowding in an Internet business sector is the category of ""push computing"" where more than two dozen companies are competing, including Net software heavyweights Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.
Many industry executives expect Microsoft and Netscape will turn push technology -- the automatic delivery of customized information over the Internet to computer users -- into a commodity market, leaving room for only a few providers.
Venture capitalists see this as an example of a broader shake-out in the Internet business.
""I think we're still deeply into the settling-out period,"" Onset Venture's Winter said.
""Is push going to be a business? It may turn out to be a technology like AI (artificial intelligence),"" rather than a full-blown business, he said.
The pace of the initial public offering (IPO) market for Internet start-ups was at its most frantic last spring when some companies gained $1 billion initial market valuations despite little promise of sustainable profits.
At the time, investment bankers joked you could write ""Internet"" on a dollar bill and they could take it public for $10, but no longer.
""Within six months 'Internet' is going to be a nasty word to use in an IPO. I predict no company going public will want to be an Internet company by then,"" said one industry executive.
Nevertheless, major companies like microprocessor maker Intel are seeking to drive adoption of Internet technologies forward and to encourage continued entrepreneurial investment, partly to ensure the continued growth of their own businesses.
""We don't think there has been enough thinking through of new content capabilities of the Internet,"" said Varney, who predicts one day there will be ""a much more aggressive integration of the Internet than we see today.""

SarahDavison,"Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy Credit Lyonnais' Asian fund management unit in a deal industry experts described as yet another sign of industry consolidation.
""This would seem to be a fairly good purchase,"" said Christopher Day, former managing director at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. ""It's another sign of consolidation.""
U.S.-based Nicholas-Applegate has agreed to buy Credit Lyonnais International Asset Management-Asia (CLIAM-Asia) for an undisclosed sum, improving Nicholas-Applegate's access to Asia while extending CLIAM-Asia's reach around the world.
""This will further strengthen Nicholas-Applegate's seasoned team of global managers and give us improved access to markets and analysts in Hong Kong, Singapore, China and other Asian countries,"" Nicholas-Applegate managing partner Arthur Nicholas said in a statement.
Paul Mack, managing director of CLIAM-Asia, said the deal would benefit his group by providing access to global distribution networks and enhancing its existing product line.
""We expect to be launching a number of new retail products utilizing the Applegate skills and also we have access to Applegate's distribution mechanism, which will allow us to sell to America, which we haven't been able to do,"" Mack said.
Although no purchase price was disclosed, analysts said Nicholas-Applegate probably paid in the upper reaches of a usual band between 1.5 percent and three percent of total assets managed by the target, in this case US$700 million.
That works out to about US$21 million. Nicholas-Applegate, based in San Diego, manages total assets of US$30 billion.
Mack denied that its debt-laden French parent bank, Credit Lyonnais, put its Asian fund unit on the auction block to raise some cash to meet anticipated privatisation requirements.
""Credit Lyonnais were approached by Nicholas-Applegate with a view to buying the operation. We were not for sale by Credit Lyonnais. It was a buy rather than a sell,"" Mack said.
Credit Lyonnais has been rescued by the French government twice from collapse under the weight of its lending excesses, and has been under pressure to sell non-French assets to meet conditions set by the European Commission for approving further state aid for the bank.
But the deal has raised speculation that Credit Lyonnais will divest its successful brokerage in Hong Kong, and heighten interest in more mergers and acquisitions among fund managers.
""Asset management and broking are some of the few parts of Credit Lyonnais making money right now,"" said Day, now an independent consultant after having been laid off as a result of industry consolidation. ""And I would imagine a lot of people will be phoning up other asset managers,"" he added.
No layoffs are expected among CLIAM-Asia's 70 staff in four offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London and San Francisco. In fact, Mack is expecting some personnel expansion to meet Nicholas-Applegate's requirements.
CLIAM-Asia will take the name of Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management.

SarahDavison,"A Royal Navy warship, bristling with weaponry, took up position on the Hong Kong waterfront on Monday to serve as a floating nerve centre for Britain's end-of-empire retreat in just 29 days time.
Dodging flimsy sampans and commuter ferries chugging about the famously crowded harbour, the multi-role frigate HMS Chatham berthed beneath glassy skyscrapers alongside the Prince of Wales barracks in the heart of the metropolis.
There it will tick away the hours, assuming the role of command centre for the British military withdrawal, until China takes back Hong Kong at the stroke of midnight on June 30.
After the historic handover, the Chatham will escort the departing Royal Yacht Britannia, with Prince Charles and colonial governor Chris Patten on board, out of Hong Kong.
Braving one of the hottest and steamiest days so far this summer, Captain Christopher Clayton said he and his crew looked forward to performing an historic task with pride.
""There is no sense of withdrawal,"" Clayton said.
""This is very much one professional armed forces handing over the protection and sovereignty of Hong Kong to another, the People's Liberation Army. So I look on it as a classic military evolution and one which we hope to do with some style, orderly and professionally.""
The arrival of the type 22 frigate coincided with a 21-gun salute by the navy's HMS Plover patrol ship on the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation, which the Chatham honoured by ""dressing overall"" in a busy selection of flags and signals.
With just 29 days to go, the frigate's arrival was the latest piece in the jigsaw puzzle of preparations for Britain's withdrawal from the pearl of its colonial possessions.
The drawdown of the garrison, a highly visible expression of the end of British sovereignty, has already cut its strength to little more than 1,000 from 10,000 in the early 1990s.
And while the British are leaving, the Chinese are arriving.
The latest contingent of 90 PLA troops drove across the border on Friday, boosting an advance guard already in place to 206 unarmed soldiers, here to get garrison facilities ready.
Offering them friendship, Clayton said the Chatham hoped to host PLA officers on board his ship.
The frigate, designed to assume flagship duties, bristles with advanced weaponry including Harpoon anti-surface missiles and Sea Wolf missiles. She also carries Sea King helicopters.
The Chatham is in the Asia-Pacific region as part of a larger 1997 task force deployment, codenamed Ocean Wave, involving a dozen vessels including the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and two nuclear submarines.
""This is not a regrettable occasion,"" said Robert Curry, a signal communications officer.
""It's an end of an era, certainly, but I don't think there should be any regret or shame at all.""
The Chatham's nimble sailors in crisp, white suits shinnied up and down the ship's narrow galleys and stairwells, outlining all its guns in loving detail to bedraggled, thirsty visitors stumbling over unexpected nuts and bolts.
""As you can see, we are not a cruise ship. We are definitely a warship,"" said principal warfare officer Phil Haslam.

SarahDavison,"Hong Kong's top civil servant Anson Chan has signalled an open rift and rising tension in the new Beijing-approved administration to take over when Britain hands control back to China on July 1.
In two outbursts in as many weeks, the Chief Secretary has called for prompt elections, a credible legislature and respect for civil liberties - a clear warning to China.
Amid widespread doubt on the scope of freedom under Chinese rule, she said she was prepared to quit if asked to accept policies that clashed with her principles.
Chan, 57, is Hong Kong's top career administrator. She is deputy to departing colonial governor Chris Patten and has been asked to stay in the post as second-in-command to future leader Tung Chee-hwa.
Tung, a conservative and former shipping magnate, is waiting to take over at the head of a new administration that includes an assembly already chosen to replace the elected legislature.
Her tough words seemed to reflect speculation in Hong Kong of rifts opening up between Tung and his top officials, such as Chan and Financial Secretary Donald Tsang.
Her remarks were seen as a warning broadside just 28 days before the handover.""She is playing here her only trump card and I'm surprised she's had to play it this early,"" David Newman, political science professor at Lingnan College, told Reuters.
""I like to think I'm a loyal civil servant, but loyalty is not everything in my eyes,"" Chan told Newsweek International in the latest of a flurry of interviews by Hong Kong political leaders as the handover nears.
""There might be issues that are points of principle, and, as a matter of conscience, you feel you can't accept those decisions,"" she said. ""When that happens, you start asking yourself 'Do I stay or do I go?' And I think most people would know what my answer would be.""
""She is signalling she will have difficulty stomaching what the political appointees are going to try to do,"" Newman said.
""It is going to be very difficult for someone with high and sincere beliefs and a liberal mind to stand silently and watch what is going to go on around here,"" he said.
Touching on arguably the most important element of the handover to China, Chan expressed strong support for the gradual introduction of democracy.
But she called for public participation in the drawing up of the electoral system to ensure that Hong Kong does end up with a ""credible"" legislature.
Her comments appeared as Tung chided Britain for introducing democratic reforms without China's consent.
""The issue is that to go ahead without the consent of the future sovereign should not happen, it shouldn't have happened,"" Tung said in a British Broadcasting Corporation interview.
The reforms have become a major source of friction between Britain and China, prompting Beijing's vow to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature on July 1. But departing governor Patten is far from remorseful.
""As it is, people in Hong Kong now have a few benchmarks,"" he said on Monday. ""They know what a free election is like.""
Chan's outspoken views drew praise from some commentators, but an editorial in the Hong Kong Standard newspaper said Chan had set ""a dangerous precedent"". ""Open challenges of this nature must not be allowed to happen,"" it said.
Bob Broadfoot, head of a think-tank, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, said the type of restrictions on the right to comment imposed on civil servants elsewhere did not apply in Hong Kong, where civil servants lead the government.
Broadfoot said he believed Chan and Tsang had decided to stay on to support Hong Kong through the transition, but he predicted their resignations within one year.
Chan is widely respected. ""A charmer and sophisticated with a core of steel,"" says one political insider.
She warned against any assault on the independence of the civil service by people with ""vested interests"" who were willing to invite China's intereference for their own benefit.
Chan said Tung was a man of principle but lacked  ""a really deep understanding of how government machinery works"".
"
SarahDavison,"One of Asia's most powerful women is drawing up a battleline in Hong Kong ready for an era of political uproar unseen elsewhere in the People's Republic.
Twenty-seven days before Britain hands the colony back to China, Hong Kong's top civil servant, is targeting a powerful group of businessmen surrounding future leader Tung Chee-hwa.
She is tough, charming Anson Chan. The 57-year-old Chinese administrator, dubbed ""an iron fist in a velvet glove,"" is one of Hong Kong's most popular personalities.
Headlines daily feature her in a tug-of-war for the political soul of the billionaire ex-shipping magnate, a China appointee under pressure to win the confidence of Hong Kong and the world.
A conservative without a political track record, he was suddenly called on to be Hong Kong's future chief executive, replacing the departing, reformist colonial governor Chris Patten.
As part of the colonial legacy, civil servants rather than elected politicians run the Hong Kong government, so the voice of Chan, their chief, carries unusual clout.
She acts as Patten's deputy and is also to become Tung's second-in-command.
Chan has chosen to assert her sweeping authority in the dying days of colonial rule in a face-off against a group of influential pro-China business cronies chosen by Tung to advise him on how to run Hong Kong.
The 6.4 million people of Hong Kong, unsure of the future under the red flag after the July 1 handover, are anxiously watching to see if an imminent showdown will crack open the new power structure.
Both Chan and the advisers will sit on the Executive Council, an inner cabinet positioned between the Chief Executive and the legislature.
""She's not exactly cracking the whip over Tung, but raising the flag over her own continued centrality,"" said Michael DeGolyer, political analyst at Baptist University of Hong Kong.
""She's saying Tung is ours, and he's not going to belong to, basically, sycophants and plutocrats.""
Chan, in a Newsweek interview this week, said she was less concerned about direct interference by China in Hong Kong's autonomy than she was about groups who might court interference ""either for misplaced motives or, worse still, for narrow, selfish, vested interests.
""Maybe some people feel that decisions affecting business are not in their interest. They may feel they should go up and appeal to various leaders. That would be very bad for Hong Kong,"" Chan said.
Pro-China politician Lau Siu-kai said the comments indicated that disagreements between Tung and his senior civil servants had reached crisis levels.
""It shows some senior officials are sceptical over the integrity, capability and poiltical orientation of the people appointed by Mr Tung,"" Lau told the South China Morning Post.
But DeGolyer dismissed speculation that her words signalled a widening rift between Tung and his senior civil servants.
""It's not so much a rift as it is (a demonstration) to other civil servants that she is the person in charge, and she will remain in charge. There will be no change,"" DeGolyer said.
""(She is saying) there is no difference between a governor appointed by far-away London and a chief executive appointed by far-away Beijing. They will continue on with business as usual.""
He described the new government as an engine going nowhere without a civil service to kick the transmission into gear.
""The engine can sit there are rev. all it wants but if the gears are not engaged, they're not going anywhere. And that's where she sits,"" he said.
Analyst Bob Broadfoot of the think-tank Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, said Chan significantly decided to speak out now because Executive Council rules will prevent her from doing so once the new government takes power.
Tung's decision to reappoint Chan, along with the entire top echelon of Hong Kong's civil service, was welcomed by the business and international community for its stabilising effect.
But in the Newsweek interview, Chan warned that Tung was unfamiliar with ""the way government machinery works.""
"
SarahDavison,"Increasing signs of an economic upswing in China have raised the question of how far speculation can be held responsible for a sudden flush of liquidity sweeping through China-related stocks in Hong Kong.
Brokerage W.I. Carr on Thursday said that improving economic fundamentals in China could be at least partly responsible for the red chip fever that has fuelled Hong Kong's outperforming stock market for months.
Dismissing any suggestion of a speculative bubble ripe for collapse, it said the soaring rally in Hong Kong red chips, or companies with financial backing in China, confirmed the beginning of a long and strong business cycle in China.
""The market is telling us something about where the Chinese economy is going and where company earnings in China are going in the future,"" said John Mulcahy, managing director of Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities in Hong Kong.
Red chips have gained on expectations of big returns from strong connections and asset injections by parents, often municipal and provincial governments. Many are trading at more than 35 times 1997 earnings, compared with the average Hong Kong blue chip ratio of 15.
Much of the rally is driven more by ""a wish and promise"" than evident earnings performance but growing signs of economic recovery in China suggest economic fundamentals could also be playing a role, Mulcahy said.
Corporate restructuring, rising productivity, disinflation and strong exports are far more responsible for strong Chinese markets than a sudden burst of liquidity from central bank credit easing last year, said economist Michael Taylor.
""Just as in other bull markets, this market is probably telling us something,"" Taylor said.
""And I believe the evidence is coherently pointing to ... the start of a long, sustained business cycle here based on restructuring and being characterised by disinflation and good trade performance,"" he said.
But Dong Tao, senior regional economist at Schroder Securities, disagreed. He said market rallies in Hong Kong and on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges were being driven by liquidity seeking better returns than those offered by a depressed Chinese industrial sector.
""I don't think a turnaround in company profits will arrive this year. I haven't seen a turnaround in demand. I haven't seen that the price wars hurting companies' bottom lines are over,"" Tao said.
China's economy is currently split between a struggling real economy, dominated by debt-laden and loss-making state-owned enterprises, and excessive liquidity, he said.
Timing is the key, Tao said. China is still struggling with flat domestic demand and huge overcapacity following the 30-percent growth rates in fixed asset investment that marked the booming early 1990s -- but that will end at some point.
Taylor argued that improvements are already surfacing, with cuts of up to 15 percent of the workforce in places such as Shanghai linked to rising productivity -- boding well for an early improvement in corporate earnings growth.
But the risk of disinflation throughout Asia threatens to undermine China's gains and puts pressure on exporters to stimulate the real economy, Taylor said.
Chinese media recently reported that exports are not expected to maintain the 26.9 percent growth rate recorded between January and April this year.
China's focus on exports to solve its economic problems has excerbated political tensions, with the China-U.S. trade surplus expected to exceed US$50 billion this year compared to about US$40 billion last year.

SarahDavison,"An unskilled labour force is Hong Kong's biggest stumbling block to a successful future under China, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank economic adviser George Leung said on Friday.
""We need people, not machinery,"" Leung told Reuters, referring to Hong Kong's transformation into a service economy from the low-skilled manufacturing days of the past.
""This is the most serious issue in Hong Kong,"" Leung said.
""And it's not a case of dumping money at the problem. We need to come up with a helpful programme to train people and raise their quality. Otherwise, we will have no resources to expand our economy.""
An exploding service sector scrambling to meet the demands of the awakening Chinese economic giant has created a huge demand for properly qualified people in Hong Kong.
Investment bankers snowed under by listing applications from Chinese companies constantly complain they cannot find qualified workers, allowing barely-skilled expatriates to walk into highly-paid jobs far beyond their grasp back home.
The demand for all types of service professionals, such as lawyers, accountants, doctors, traders, analysts and others, has skyrocketed, putting upward pressure on overall wage rates and fuelling inflation.
The shortage can only get worse. China's economy is expected to double in size over the next decade, and Hong Kong's school system is unequipped to meet the new demand.
A shortage of school space is forcing Hong Kong's future workforce to attend school in shifts, and studies show Hong Kong students score lower in mathematics and science tests than rivals elsewhere in Asia.
This problem threatens to turn into a crisis within the decade, Leung warned. Under current circumstances, Hong Kong will be unable to find sufficient expatriates to meet its needs, possibly allowing centres such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo to step in to meet demand.
Standards of English, the language of international commerce, are already considered to be lower in Hong Kong than in Singapore.
They will worsen further following the reversion of sovereignty to China on July 1, with an increasing emphasis on Mandarin as the common language of China rather than English, a legacy of a period considered shameful to China.
""We have got to place more emphasis on this otherwise we will be at a disadvantage,"" Leung said.
Anybody who doubted the importance of English to Hong Kong needed only turn to Tokyo, said Leung, where a lack of language ability had caused Japan to lag Hong Kong and Singapore as an Asia-Pacific financial centre, despite Japan's bigger markets.
Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa has appointed a special task force to review the education system, which Leung said was a good idea.
""At least they know it is one of the most important factors affecting Hong Kong,"" Leung said.
But he is waiting to see what recommendations surface, calling for practical steps to massively upgrade the labour force's skill sets to match Hong Kong's new economic identity.

SarahDavison,"With the memory of Thailand's banking sector implosion still fresh, alarm bells are starting to sound about banks' property exposure in Hong Kong.
Massive capital inflows into the territory, most driven by optimism about Hong Kong's reversion to China at midnight on June 30, have fuelled an explosion in bank loans for property.
The enthusiasm evokes memories of the building boom that helped push Thailand to the brink of economic collapse earlier this year, with banks weighted under by bad loans.
Widely viewed as Hong Kong's most accurate confidence indicator, soaring property prices are considered by many people to be yet another sign that all is well with the territory's handover to China just around the corner.
But others are urging officials to check out the foundations on which the boom is built.
""There appears to be an assumption among Hong Kong bankers -- not to mention their clients -- that they can print as much money as needed to keep property and other asset prices in orbit indefinitely,"" said Hugh Peyman in a recent report by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (DKB).
David Lui, director at Schroder Securities, took up the same issue at a public forum on Tuesday.
""If property prices continue to rise, that will affect the soundness (of the financial sector),"" Lui said.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the territory's de facto central bank, warned late last month that additional restraints in mortgage lending might be required, taking some of the steam out of Hong Kong's hyperactive stock market.
Profit-taking hit property counters on Wednesday despite the Hang Seng Index's overall recovery from early lows. The blue-chip index was up 105 points, or 0.73 percent, at 14,545 at midday, while the property sub-index was down 0.48 percent.
DKB dismissed the HKMA's warning as ""tepid"".
""The horse may already have bolted,"" Peyman said. ""The pressure on the HKMA not to (do) anything to stop the current asset price orgy is clear enough, particularly with the handover only a month away.""
Outstanding property lending has risen 26 percent in one year. Property and construction now account for 47 percent of all Hong Kong lending, Peyman said.
""These massive increases in property lending have taken place against a backdrop of the lowest new supply of residential flats in 23 years,"" he said.
Mortgage loans now account for 22 percent of all loans, and loans to developers have hit HK$363 billion (US$46.5 billion) -- up 18 percent over six months and 30 percent over one year.
Hong Kong's fixed exchange rate and open capital account leave the HKMA very little room to manoeuvre to calm the frenzy, except to resort to aggressive hands-on lending restrictions.
Local banks are already restricted to a 40 percent property exposure, but the HKMA has no control over foreign banks who usually enter late in a boom and give the biggest boost to lending as they grab for market share at any cost.
DKB said the figures are worrying enough to suggest tougher HKMA action to dampen down credit expansion before the September International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting in Hong Kong.
But other analysts adopted a more sanguine view.
The start-up of a new mortgage corporation later this year will eat up some of the banks loans as property debts are securitised, said Clive McDonnell, economist at SocGen Crosby.
More important than lending restrictions are plans already announced by the new Hong Kong government to increase supply.
""There has been a level of excess liquidity and that's been feeding through into property prices,"" McDonnell said. ""However, long-term trends will affect the short term. People will not pile into property if trend supply increases.""
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang has already pledged to release 51 hectares of land for development over the next five years, which translates into about 30,500 units each year.

SarahDavison,"Institutional investors applauded China's attempts to cool down stock market speculation last week but warned that Hong Kong's volatile reaction was unlikely to end any time soon.
""Undoubtedly, the very considerable volatility requires someone to be very brave indeed to participate, and it will continue to remain that way for quite some time to come,"" said Stewart Aldcroft, director of sales and marketing for Templeton Franklin Investment Services (Asia) Ltd.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index of blue chip stocks closed Friday's see-saw session up 188.21 points or 1.35 percent at 14,112.55 following a total drop of 907 points in five consecutive trading sessions ending on Thursday.
The index swung wildly on a variety of factors, including China's move to curb speculation, jitters about the property market and a downgrade by Merrill Lynch.
As usual of late, the real action was in red chips, that unruly bunch of China-related stocks that have taken investors on a roller-coaster ride since February.
The sector, made up of companies with financial backing from China, responded very badly to news that Beijing intended to clamp down on the stocks, many of which listed in Hong Kong with promises of future asset injections of uncertain value.
Now trading in excess of 30 times 1997 earnings, the red chips have outperformed the rest of the Hong Kong market by a wide margin. But last week they shed about one-third of the gains they have made since January, according to one estimate.
""The extent to which there has been speculation about which red chip is going to get the next asset insertion and how valuable it will be has clearly got out of hand,"" Aldcroft said.
Templeton and other international institutions with established valuation criteria have avoided the sector while retail and smaller brokerages leapt on board, speculating about the value of promised assets and connections.
How do you establish a multiple for influence? one asked.
Although the larger institutions appear to have steered clear on these sorts of concerns, plenty of smaller funds have invested, according to funds authority Micropal.
China fund performance figures to June 6 show GT up by 56.6 percent, Barclays up 51 percent, ImPac up 47 percent, Nomura and Guinness Flight up 45 percent, Invesco up 38 percent, HSBC up 35 percent and Jardine Fleming up 34 percent.
""You couldn't get that type of performance if you hadn't been invested in red chips,"" Aldcroft said.
But both Jardine Fleming and HSBC said they limited their exposure to the biggest and most credible red chips.
""Among them there are good quality companies with solid earnings growth,"" said Jardine Fleming investment director Patrick Wong, who put JF's red chip weighting at 15 percent.
Prudential Asia's senior portfolio manager, David Descalzi, said he had avoided the sector completely -- a difficult position to take when profits were there to be had.
""No fund manager likes to be left behind,"" he said. ""But there has to be a recognition that this is speculative and there will be a correction, which is what has happened.""
But Prudential is buying into market weakness, and Descalzi said if the red chips run again, they will be harder to ignore.
""Hong Kong is still one of the only viable stories out here, with the possible exception of Korea, and we want to take advantage of that,"" he said.
"
SarahDavison,"Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang took a political gamble by accepting a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth in the last days of British colonial rule, political analysts said on Monday.
Some believe his acceptance of the honour could antagonise China and ensure his early resignation from a sensitive post as the second most powerful bureaucrat in executive-led Hong Kong.
""All these guys are going to be transitional figures. Call me in a year and see if he's still around,"" said one leading political scientist who declined to be identified.
But others argue that China ignores such honours, which have been liberally bestowed upon members of Hong Kong's old and new elites.
""So I don't think it's that big an issue, especially given this environment where the Chinese are trying to absorb the British establishment,"" said Joseph Cheng, professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong.
Tsang, effectively finance minister, has made little public reference to the award, except to say that he remains committed to Hong Kong after 30 years in the civil service.
But some analysts said his decision to accept the honours, routinely given to top civil servants in Hong Kong, was significant just a few days before Britain hands back the colony on July 1.
Tsang's acceptance of the knighthood was thrown into high relief by civil service head Anson Chan's decision to decline the same honour, which would have made her a ""Dame"" in line with his ""Sir"" prefix.
The popular Chan, widely considered one of the most powerful women in Asia, first declined to be knighted in 1992 when her name cropped up as a possible contender for chief executive, an appointment she chose not to pursue.
The post went to Tung Chee-hwa, the billionaire shipping tycoon who will replace departing colonial governor Chris Patten at midnight on June 30.
""Not giving (Chan) a knighthood will probably protect her as she is the leader of the civil service,"" said Sunny Lo, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong.
But it could also be an attempt to cement a relationship between Tung and Chan, who has very publicly announced her readiness to resign on principle if necessary after July 1.
""The British administration support the alliance between Anson Chan and Tung Chee-hwa and this seems to be confirmed in giving the knighthood to Tsang and not Chan,"" Lo said.
But he declined to be drawn on whether Tsang's acceptance of the award would make him vulnerable to Chinese antagonism in the same way Chan's refusal might protect her from it.
City University's Cheng argued that the issue was, to all intents and purposes, irrelevant.
""The vast majority of these people accept them,"" he said, referring to Hong Kong's honoured elites. Such titles are so common they are virtually meaningless, Cheng said.
""The knighthood will not affect Tsang's future career. He's already reached the top level so having the knighthood won't make any difference,"" Lo said.
"
SarahDavison,"Western Europe's envoy in Hong Kong said on Monday that he expected most European governments to ignore an Anglo-American boycott and attend the inauguration of an unelected provisional legislature on July 1.
""Officially I don't know yet what the position of our various governments will be but certainly from preliminary soundings I would not be surprised if most governments will attend the inauguration ceremony,"" Etienne Reuter said.
He is the European Union representative in Hong Kong, effectively ambassador for the 15-nation bloc.
To Western dismay, Hong Kong's elected parliament is to be scrapped when Britain hands the territory to China which has chosen an interim assembly instead. Britain and the United States say they will boycott the swearing-in ceremony but other countries like Australia have refused to snub Beijing.
The envoy told Reuters in an interview that European countries are deciding how to respond to China's invitation, and will probably discuss the issue on the fringes of Monday's EU summit in Amsterdam.
Moments after the handover ceremony, Beijing intends to inaugurate the new, China-appointed body as the legislature governing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright have pledged to avoid the inauguration to protest the dissolution of the existing chamber, which departing governor Chris Patten revised in 1994 with democratic reforms that angered China.
Britain has not asked for the EU's support for its boycott, and the absence of an official request suggests most European governments would probably accept China's invitation to attend.
""Formally, the U.K. has not asked for the partners to do something or support them on this and so far, the EU has never officially expressed a view on the legal status of the provisional (parliament) - although we have said it was unnecessary,"" Reuter said.
The provisional legislature will govern Hong Kong until elections are held within one year, as promised both by China and future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa.
""We also appreciate that the chief executive has promised that there will elections in the first year, that is part of the equation,"" Reuter said.
In all likelihood, China will simply not issue invitations to people who have said they will not attend to avoid losing ""face"", Reuter said.
Europe hoped for an auspicious start to relations with the Hong Kong SAR, and viewed as positive the appointments of Tung as chief executive and barrister Andrew Li as chief justice, Reuter said.
"
SarahDavison,"Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa has sparked fresh suspicions over China's plans for the territory by announcing changes to the lower tiers of government which critics see as a further rollback for democracy.
The move was followed on Tuesday by the release of a survey confirming a continued decline in political confidence in Hong Kong just days before the territory's return to Chinese rule.
On Monday Tung, who takes over as Hong Kong's chief executive on July 1, unveiled a system that will dilute democratic representation on second-tier government bodies through the appointment of a number of pro-China names.
Commentators welcomed the retention of all members of existing local councils and district boards but the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's most popular and vocal political group, saw the addition of pro-Beijing appointees as yet another attempt to roll back democracy in the dying days of British colonial rule.
""Mr Tung has put the old story back. It is a very bad message to the whole world that Hong Kong is going backward in terms of democracy,"" Democratic Party vice chairman Yeung Sum told government radio in Hong Kong.
""China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong under the so-called (policy) 'Hong Kong ruling Hong Kong', (but) Mr. Tung has added the appointed system to the two councils as well as the district boards,"" said Yeung. ""It is very ironic.""
The confidence survey released on Tuesday was carried out by Baptist University of Hong Kong, which is monitoring local attitudes to the handover under its Transition Project.
""Political pessimism this time seems to have risen over the survey in February,"" political analyst Michael DeGolyer of Baptist University told Hong Kong radio.
The survey also underlines the division between economic and political confidence, with two-thirds of Hong Kong people confident about their economic future but uncertain about their political fate, DeGolyer said.
The findings confirm a prevailing attitude of ""doom and boom"" in Hong Kong, he said, with the stock market reaching new highs and red chips, or China-related stocks, roaring ahead on handover optimism while political confidence slides.
""Economic optimism has gone up, political pessimism has gone up. It's almost a kind of a schizophrenic attitude,"" he said.
Under Tung's changes, pro-Beijing names were handed the lion's share of 116 new appointed seats on urban and regional councils and district boards, the vast majority of whose existing members were elected under democratic reforms introduced i n 1994 by departing colonial governor Chris Patten.
Nine new members will be appointed to the Urban Council, which runs municipal affairs in Hong Kong proper while 11 new appointments will be made to the Regional Council, which performs municipal government functions in the New Territories.
Tung has also added another 96 appointed seats to Hong Kong's 18 District Boards, which advise the government on issues in various districts around the territory.
The changes, which take effect after the handover on July 1, complement plans to replace the territory's existing, elected legislature with an interim China-appointed body.
The interim legislature, which will govern Hong Kong until democratic elections promised within one year of the handover, has become a flashpoint of controversy between China and Western nations who object to the rollback of democracy in Hong Kong.
China, which was angered by Patten's reforms, has promised Hong Kong a staggered introduction of democracy.
"
SarahDavison,"Fears are rising in Hong Kong that a ""symbolic gesture"" by the Democratic Party early on the territory's first day under China will turn nasty despite the Democrats' commitment to peaceful protest.
Hong Kong's largest party says it will occupy the chamber of parliament, expressing anger at the elected assembly's death as a globally-televised handover ceremony and gala takes place nearby.
""I'm really afraid (if) something goes wrong at this time, and it's not anybody's fault,"" said Bob Broadfoot, who manages the think-tank Political and Economic Risk Consultancy.
""That would be such a bad thing for Hong Kong right now and who wants that? If something like that happens, fingers will point and everyone will be blaming everyone else.""
In a move bound to irritate China, which regularly warns against ""subversion"", Democratic Party vice-chairman Yeung Sam confirmed a plan to protest the swearing-in of a new legislature after Hong Kong returns to Chinese control at midnight June 30.
The protest will highlight the most contentious issue of Hong Kong's return to China -- the Beijing-appointed interim legislature will replace the existing, democratically-elected parliament, to the dismay of democrats and the West.
Yeung said a delegation of Democrats is determined to enter the Legislative Council (Legco) chamber and, in a symbolic gesture, pledge support for democracy as well as China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong through speeches issued from the chamber's balcony.
The protest will take place just as the new provisional legislature is being sworn in - a ceremony Western leaders including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have pledged to avoid.
Future leader Tung Chee-hwa and police chiefs were not available to outline how they would respond.
Yeung on Wednesday reiterated his party's support for peaceful, non-violent protest but repeated earlier statements threatening ""radical"" action if the delegation was obstructed.
""I think it's better we wait and see,"" Yeung told Reuters, when asked what ""radical"" meant.
""I can only say we are determined to go back to Legco....We want to declare our determination in a symbolic gesture but we hope this can be carried out in a peaceful manner. So I will stop from speculating what we will do.""
He did, however, reveal that ""negotiations"" were still under way with Tung's office, which has apparently advised the Democrats against holding rallies.
""The thing is, can we come back to the Legco building? We are still talking about that,"" Yeung said.
The protest plans confirm expectations long held in Hong Kong that the Democrats would use the presence of more than 6,000 journalists from around the world to lobby for democracy in China's newest Special Administrative Region.
The plans are restricted so far to the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's loudest political group, but independent Democrat Emily Lau said other legislative groups had been invited to take part.
""We appreciate people have different ways of expression,"" Lau said. ""Is that confrontation? I certainly don't think that's confrontation...They just want to do some gesture. I don't think it's something that is really that intolerable. So I don't see why (the police would) want to create a scene.""
"
SarahDavison,"Taiwan has stepped forward in the delicate run-up to Hong Kong's reversion to China and rejected once more the ""one country, two systems"" policy guiding the territory's July 1 handover to mainland rule.
In a souvenir edition of the Far Eastern Economic Review, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui wished Hong Kong well after its return to China but repeated his island's determination never to unify with China under the same terms.
""We hope that Hong Kong will not only preserve its present system of freedom, democracy and openness, but enjoy further development after 1997,"" Lee said in a paid advertisement.
""However, the (Taiwan) government cannot accept the 'one China, two systems' formula imposed on Hong Kong by Peking (Beijing), because the state of division across the Taiwan Strait differs categorically from Hong Kong's situation.""
The statement, a striking reminder of the China-Taiwan issue at a sensitive moment, followed Taiwan's confirmation of annual wargames on June 23-24 in the Taiwan Strait, the scene last year of a tense stand-off between the ""two Chinas"".
Communist Beijing has considered Taiwan a renegade province since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949 and the defeated Nationalists (Kuomintang) set up a rival government there.
China staged eight months of war games near Taiwan in the run-up to the island's March 1996 presidential election, which Beijing suspected was a bid to pursue full independence.
China fully intends to reclaim Taiwan, by force if necessary, and designed the ""one country, two systems"" policy with Taiwan -- not just Hong Kong -- in mind.
But Taiwan, which calls itself the Republic of China, has ruled out unification until China's Communist Party gives up its political monopoly and introduces pluralism.
Most political analysts said the ostensibly routine nature of Taiwan's summer military exercises was belied by their timing. Taiwan rejects any link between the wargames and Hong Kong's handover, but few Hong Kong commentators are convinced.
""The timing of the wargames is certainly related to the Taipei government's position on the Hong Kong issue and I think wargames have these political connotations,"" said Joseph Cheng, professor of political science at City University in Hong Kong.
Michael DeGolyer, professor of political science at Baptist University in Hong Kong, said that the purpose of the exercises was to send a message.
""You have to ask yourself just how subtle is shooting off a bunch of rockets, but it does get across the clear statement that the ""one country, two systems"" formula by which Hong Kong is being returned to China does not apply to them,"" he said.
Yet most analysts do not expect any major disruption, citing Taiwan's commitment to a smooth Hong Kong transition and the international community's awareness of issues in the strait.
""Will all this have a significant impact on the handover? No,"" said Richard Margolis, political analyst at broker Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.
""The scene is set for the handover. It will be full of symbolism but when the first of July rolls around the overall expectation is that it will be business as usual.""
DeGolyer said that now was the wrong time for China to force the Taiwan issue. Although Taiwan originally topped China's reunification agenda, Britain's insistence on settling the Hong Kong issue has guaranteed that the next couple of years will be spent ensuring the territory is functioning well, he said.
""If there's any time at which we could consider the Taiwan issue to be the least likely to blow up in our face, this is probably it,"" DeGolyer said.
But he warned that Chinese President Jiang Zemin had explicitly pledged to resolve the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, just as former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping stated his intention to settle Hong Kong during his tenure.

SarahDavison,"China's move to tighten up controls on red chip shares follows increasing signs that the country is ready to bite the bullet and confront its structural economic problems, economists said.
Both economic and political circumstances are ripe for a new set of policy initiatives following last February's death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, Geoff Lewis, chief economist with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, wrote in a recent research note.
Lewis was not expecting any major policy announcement before Hong Kong's July 1 return to Chinese rule.
Yet on Friday, following the biggest one-day gain ever by Hong Kong's main index, China stepped in and announced new measures to tighten up controls on red chips, the unruly bunch of China-related stocks that have taken Hong Kong by storm.
The announcement followed a gain of 647.87 points, or 4.5 percent, in the Hang Seng index to a record 15,154.36.
China now will require all Chinese-controlled companies to obtain approvals before listing overseas.
Companies will also be required to get approvals for transfers of domestic assets into listed affiliates, a widespread activity that has prompted rampant speculation about the value of future asset injections.
""As economic views converge during the succession, so political stability increases and so does the chance of decisive policy implementation,"" Lewis wrote.
This apparent, renewed movement in economic policy follows a number of recent warnings from economists that China's growth rates are due to drop below expectations, and that deflationary pressures are mounting.
""We're not only seeing disinflationary pressures coming from within China, we're also seeing it reflected in the region as a whole. There are myriad sources of confirmation for this particular view, and I think China's disinflationary forces are going to become one of the major stories this year,"" Michael Taylor, economist with W.I. Carr said recently.
Both W.I. Carr and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson believe China's long-term economic prospects remain strong, but DKB has warned that deflation will add to other forces hampering growth rates, which have already started to fail to meet expectations.
China's first quarter gross domestic product grew by 9.4 percent against expectations of 10.2 percent, and reports have surfaced that the government has cut its short-term forecast to about seven percent in order to achieve a reduced long-term forecast of eight percent.
Earlier expectations saw China's economy expanding by 10 percent each year for the next decade.
""China has entered a new, disinflationary phase, and the rapid price rises characterising the early years of the economic reform process are unlikely to recur for the time being,"" said John Mulcahy, managing director, Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities.
Although the evident shift in government economic policy bodes ill for investors awaiting the return of the rip-roaring market rallies of the pre-1993 era, economists welcomed the new approach as yet another sign of China's economic competence.
""Long term, we are more confident about China's economic future than for many years: the problems are in the short term,"" Lewis said.
""Our confidence arises from a higher degree of economic literacy among the leadership. They -- in Beijing at least -- all seem to understand the costs of high inflation and the need for structural reform, which must be given a chance to work even if the short-term, consequences are negative.""
"
SarahDavison,"After July 1, Hong Kong's role as facilitator of China-Taiwan trade will continue and probably expand, but the territory's reversion to mainland rule is bound to heighten sensitivities between the ""two Chinas"", experts say.
""I don't think after the first of July we will see a negative effect on triangular trade (between Hong Kong, Taiwan and China) but some of the issues, their handling will become much more sensitive,"" said George Leung, economic adviser at Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp.
Direct trade and investment between two of Asia's largest and most vibrant economies have been banned for 48 years, creating a lucrative opportunity for Hong Kong to act as the gateway for indirect Taiwan-China trade and investment.
The ban on direct business, transport and communication links dates from 1949, when China's Communists won the civil war on the mainland and the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan, but the rivals' interest in indirect economic ties has overcome the political tensions -- to Hong Kong's benefit.
Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty, set for midnight on June 30, at first seemed to threaten a delicate but workable arrangement. But experts say the ""one country, two systems"" policy guiding Hong Kong's transition -- and intended by China as the model for Taiwan reunification -- has allowed the continuation of an important triangular trade relationship.
Under this policy, Hong Kong will remain a separate customs territory, reflecting Beijing's promise of a high degree of autonomy as enshrined in Hong Kong's new mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
China and Taiwan also recently sealed a pact that lessens any diplomatic nervousness about Taiwanese and Chinese vessels moving through each other's waters.
After the handover, Taiwanese vessels will remove all flags in Hong Kong waters while Hong Kong ships visiting Taiwan will fly only the flag of the new Special Administrative Region.
""I don't see any particular problem, both the Chinese and Taiwanese governments recognise the economic benefit they both derive from trade linkage,"" Leung said.
""And the past offers lots of examples that no matter how strained the relationship seemed to be, it had very little impact on economic ties...They argue on the political issues but never on economics.""
Experts said the greatest harbinger of change for Greater China trade is not Hong Kong's handover but last January's agreement on direct shipping links between China and Taiwan.
Less than one year after the March 1996 Taiwan Straits missile crisis -- an incident that damaged trade throughout the region and pressured economic growth in Hong Kong -- shipping executives agreed to start direct cross-strait shipping between Xiamen and Fuzhou in China and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
""Everyone's worried about those sorts of developments. Shipping, aircraft, everything comes through here,"" said Ian Perkin, economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
The shipping deal followed a June 1996 air accord which set up a ""genuine interaction"" between Taiwan, Hong Kong and China through the establishment of Taiwan-Hong Kong air routes.
The deal effectively granted a carrier controlled by communist China unprecedented access to Taiwan.
Michael Martin, assistant economist at Hong Kong's Trade Development Council, said the volume of goods involved in the first shipping deal agreed to last week was too small to have much of an impact, but any broader deal would affect Hong Kong greatly.
""If there were a change such that Taiwan and mainland China were to come up with a new agreement that would allow goods directly from Taiwan to China or the other way, that's a new ballgame. We're talking about a larger volume of goods or products,"" Martin said.
Hong Kong exports to Taiwan were valued at US$4.2 billion in 1996 with Taiwanese imports to Hong Kong valued at US$15.8 billion, of which US$10.8 billion were re-exported, many of them to China.
TDC figures also showed 11,254 Taiwanese projects in China and an accumulated investment of US$5.64 billion at the end of 1995, but this is by no means the end of the story.
Hong Kong accounts for about 60 percent of all investment in China, some of which is bound to originate in Taiwan but end up disguised as foreign joint ventures. Hong Kong invested US$80 billion in China in 1995.
"
SarahDavison,"Merging the Hong Kong dollar with China's renminbi is impossible in the short-term and unlikely in the long-term, a panel of experts said on Monday.
A currency merger could only be contemplated once China's capital account is fully open, allowing for free movement of financial assets in and out of the country, they told a conference organised by the Far Eastern Economic Review. They said this could take at least five years.
""Economically, the fact that the Renminbi is still not a fully-convertible currency also argues against a possible merging of the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi as Hong Kong needs a convertible currency to maintain its status as an international financial centre,"" said T.C. Chan, head of investment banking for Citibank in Hong Kong.
But Hong Kong can still look forward to 50 years of autonomous control of its monetary system, as enshrined in agreements governing Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese control and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
""If we set aside the political considerations, which are largely judgmental, the merging of the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi is simply legally not possible,"" Chan said.
Reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be key to convertibility for China, said Andrew Freris, Bank of America managing director in Hong Kong.
The SOEs, plagued by debt, have compromised China's banking sector. SOEs must be reformed to return integrity to China's banks, Freris told the conference.
Only when the banking sector has reduced its exposure to the SOEs will China be able to establish a fully-functioning interbank market, which can then act as the vehicle to establish market-determined interest rates, Freris said.
""The market must have the capacity to allow domestic rates (to) rise far enough to attract or repel capital,"" he said. ""If you do not have fully operational market-determined interest rates, convertibility is a non-starter.""
Instead of anticipating the eradication of its own currency, Hong Kong should look forward to convertibility of the Chinese yuan for the opportunities it will present, Freris said.
""Hong Kong will be able to derive more business from fund flows in and out of China,"" he said. ""But I do think that two monetary systems will remain separate. The fact the renminbi becomes convertible will not affect the separateness of the two systems.""
The idea of two monetary systems co-existing within one sovereign state is not unusual, Freris argued.
Argentina countered hyperinflation for many years by allowing its freely convertible peso to function alongside a U.S. ""dollarised"" economy.
Brazil and Uruguay are similarly dollarised, with U.S. currency used for all major transactions, he said.
"
SarahDavison,"Hong Kong's business and political leaders are gearing up to face a tough new world when the handover party is over.
Surrounded by rival Asian tiger economies, the territory can no longer rely on its historic role as the outside world's gateway to China to maintain its position as the world's seventh biggest trading economy.
""Our economic challenge is to improve Hong Kong's competitiveness in the new world order,"" future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.
A quick glance at rivals Singapore, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo has convinced Hong Kong's new leaders that drastic action is necessary.
Tung said Hong Kong had to become ""more compassionate and caring"" and tackle problems in education, housing and care of the elderly.
""Only if we succeed in meeting these challenges can we sustain our economic vitality and thereby continue to create wealth and improve the quality of life of all the people of Hong Kong,"" he declared.
""LIVELIHOOD"" ISSUES AT THE FOREFRONT
Tung's blend of economic and social policy into ""livelihood"" issues masks controversy over the prospect of government intervention in an economy dubbed the world's freest.
With a cash pile of HK$330 billion (US$42 billion) in reserves, Tung and his advisers have plenty of ammunition to fire at improvement targets.
Easy access to the cheap labour regions of southern China allowed Hong Kong's manufacturing base to explode and multiply when China opened its doors to foreign investment in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Once a manufacturing base dependent on exports of labour-intensive, low-value goods, Hong Kong has been transformed into a service centre geared to China's emergence.
Manufacturing's contribution to Hong Kong's gross domestic product has plunged to single digits from more than 50 percent in the 1970s. Meanwhile, services have soared to 85 percent of GDP and are rising.
The speed of this process has amazed economists around the world -- and has created a new set of challenges for Hong Kong.
WAGES, PROPERTY CRUSH
The most obvious is a shortage of skilled workers.
""We need people, not machinery,"" George Leung, economic adviser at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, said. ""This is the most serious issue in Hong Kong.""
Wage rates are rising, putting pressure on inflation rates even while unemployment rises -- a new phenomenon.
Demand is switching from high-labour, low-skilled jobs to white-collar occupations such as accountants, lawyers, managers and investment bankers.
The education system is ill-suited. Business leaders have called for government action to address a shortage of schools and properly qualified teachers.
""It's not a question of dumping money at the problem,"" Leung said. ""We need to come up with a helpful programme to train people and raise their quality. Otherwise, we will have no resources to expand our economy.""
With China's economy expected to double within the decade, Leung believes Hong Kong could face critical labour shortages in the next 10 years unless it acts aggressively now.
Rivals Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Tokyo are waiting to pounce on failure.
Tung has appointed one adviser to draw up a detailed education policy and asked another for guidance on how to tackle Hong Kong's critical property shortage.
Both wages and property make a major contribution to high costs, Hong Kong's major handicap in the competitiveness stakes. Rents and wages are higher than virtually anywhere else in Asia.
"
SarahDavison,"Hong Kong's stock market has been reaching for record highs in anticipation of business as usual -- or maybe even better than usual -- after China takes control on July 1.
But the optimism is not shared by all.
As the handover approaches, the small but influential group surrounding former shipping magnate and future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa is having an anxiety attack about Hong Kong's competitiveness -- and with good reason, according to some.
Some of Tung's advisers even support intervening in Hong Kong's economy.
Everyone's inability to define, precisely, what it is that has made Hong Kong an economic marvel has prompted fears that some magical elixir will dissipate as soon as China takes charge at midnight on June 30.
A free port and strong markets, easy international access and firm defence of the rule of law are acknowledged as key underpinnings to Hong Kong's economic success.
But these features are common in cities around the world.
Most people believe that Hong Kong survives and thrives on a number of less quantifiable elements. Ranking high among these is the ""borrowed time, borrowed place"" mentality.
With the date July 1, 1997, etched in the backs of their minds, Chinese emigres worked against time in Hong Kong, using ingenuity and determination to transform themselves into some of the world's wealthiest people.
Often in the space of just a few years, the explosive energy of these time-sensitive tycoons spawned huge and diverse conglomerates, notable for their concentration of authority in the iron fist of the founder and his family.
But with China on the doorstep, Hong Kong has discovered that the days of rags-to-riches are not so much over as very, very different.
And that's where Hong Kong is having difficulty.
HONG KONG INC - JUST AN ACCIDENT?
Those who built Hong Kong Inc and know it best quietly fear its success was due more to accident than design, and that replication in the future will prove increasingly hard.
China's decision to slam its door shut following the 1949 Communist revolution forced Hong Kong to diversify away from its obvious strength as a deep-water port and trading entrepot.
Shanghai industrialists fled en masse to Hong Kong, bringing capital, know-how and drive, and a readiness to exploit cheap refugee labour flooding across the border from southern China.
""Hong Kong's natural advantage as an entry port to China disappeared. What emerged was an advantage in industry. Capital was there, management was there, labour was there,"" said Richard Wong, professor of economics at Hong Kong University.
It was a magic combination that established Hong Kong as a labour-intensive, low value-added manufacturing centre.
China's re-emergence into the world in the late 1970s merely added to the momentum. Hong Kong businessmen moved factories to where labour was cheaper -- into southern China.
It has been an intensive process that, 18 years later, is considered almost complete.
With the July 1 transition to Chinese rule now upon them, the Shanghai dynasties who made Hong Kong what it is today are asking, what next?
HONG KONG HARE RACING ASIAN TORTOISE
""We do not think that the present system can be sustained on its current trajectory,"" Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professors Suzanne Berger and Richard Lester said in their study, ""Made by Hong Kong"".
MIT argues that, at some point, Hong Kong is going to have to stop seeking lower costs and start adding value. Labour costs are rising in south China, and factories are moving elsewhere.
MIT believes the incoming generation of ""Made by Hong Kong"" tycoons will have to shed the ""make a quick buck"" attitude of the past and invest for the long-term -- and they should do so soon because rising regional competition is starting to expose some obvious flaws in Hong Kong's short-term approach.
Almost like the hare that dashed ahead of the tortoise in the nursery tale, Hong Kong's ad hoc path to success could end up taking longer than the slow but steady course plotted by Asian tortoises like Singapore.
Singapore has already outpaced Hong Kong as the world's most competitive economy according to Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, who cites its better-educated and skilled workforce.
Singapore's labour and housing costs are lower and its English standards higher than in Hong Kong, reflecting the island's early recognition of its role as an Asian service centre in an increasingly competitive region.
""We are only now starting to talk about crafting competitive plans to attract the industries of tomorrow -- years after Singapore,"" one Hong Kong businessman told MIT.
"
SarahDavison,"Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang issued a strong message of stability and prosperity on Wednesday, just days before the territory's return to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.
In an interview with Reuters, Tsang restated the continuation of Hong Kong's independent monetary system and fixed exchange rate after July 1, warning that any change in the system that has underpinned the territory's economic success for nearly 14 years would be unwise.
""It would be foolhardy to make a dramatic change of that system at the change of sovereignty,"" Tsang said.
""For me, the continuation of the linked exchange rate is fundamental in reassuring international investors that the systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged.""
Tsang, who will remain as the second most powerful bureaucrat in executive-led Hong Kong after the handover, said the maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity was a matter of national pride for China.
""Hong Kong as a prosperous economic centre is a matter of great national honour for China,"" he said. ""We will continue to be prosperous, the stock market will continue to be strong, all the economic indicators are robust,"" he said.
Apart from Hong Kong's close proximity to China's expanding economy, Tsang said four key features were responsible for the territory's past economic success and would determine its future prosperity -- rule of law, fair business practice, a corruption-free public service and the free flow of information.
""Our judicial system is respected, our legislative system is respected and we have a very good track record in that everyone will be treated fairly,"" Tsang said.
""We have a duty-free port, we have a totally convertible currency, making sure the market does not pose any impediment to foreign traders and foreign investors. So that is absolutely important, the level playing field.""
So is the free flow of information. Tsang said freedom of political reporting is just as important as economic reporting.
""If I were an investor I would want to know whether my money was sitting on a gold mine or a powder keg,"" he said.
One of the few areas where there could be change to coincide with the sovereignty switch was management of Hong Kong's massive cash pile, which might now gain from a less conservative investment strategy.
The Land Fund, the US$19 billion cash mountain generated from government property sales, will remain untouched in the short term.
But the Exchange Fund holding Hong Kong's war chest of US$63.8 billion in foreign exchange reserves could tolerate a greater risk profile now that the political uncertainty associated with the transition will soon be past, Tsang said.
But he issued a forceful reminder to those who suggest the money could be spent on infrastructure projects in southern China or on supporting new industrial sectors in Hong Kong, such as a high-technology industry.
""This is our money,"" he said, warning that legislative approval would be required to move funds outside the territory.
Those who hope to pressure Tsang into supporting their ideas could be in for a battle.
""As financial secretary, I have always been under pressure to change things, to shell out more money for pork-barrelling politics, for subsidising industry, for subsidising transport,"" Tsang said.
""I have a pretty tough skin on this. I know (where) Hong Kong's longer term interests lie, in my view, and I think we have got international bodies supporting my views and the local community generally agrees with me, too.""

SarahDavison,"Tigers ready to pounce or a litter of clawless wannabes?
Surrounded by the burgeoning states of Asia, Hong Kong is wondering just how long it can rely upon its traditional strengths -- proximity to China, developed markets, a huge and free port -- for prosperity into the next millennium.
Rival tiger states from Singapore to Jakarta are sharpening their claws and developing fast, preparing for China's arrival.
They are growing so fast that financial powerhouse Hong Kong has started to wonder how well-prepared it is to defend its position as China's primary financial service centre.
An inadequate education system, declining standards of English, rising costs and an under-skilled labour force are just some of the hurdles facing Hong Kong -- and grabbing the attention of some of Asia's youngest and fiercest tigers.
TIGERS UNSHEATH THEIR CLAWS
Tokyo and Singapore pose the most immediate threat.
Tokyo's loss of business to lower cost, less regulated rivals such as Hong Kong and Singapore was one of the key motivations for the shake-out now hitting Japan's financial sector, termed the Big Bang.
Many of the reforms will take effect before the 2001 deadline, allowing Tokyo to claw back business from Hong Kong's grasp - but the process could take a while, analysts said.
""Immediate gains may not be so large,"" said Takashi Kiuchi, head of economic research at LTCB Research Institute Inc.
Despite Tokyo's obvious size and strength, Singapore is considered the Asian tiger with the sharpest teeth -- and time is on its side.
""Tokyo is still in the early stage of its liberalisation program,"" said Eddie Lee, economist at Vickers Ballas in Singapore. ""And in five to 10 years time, Singapore would have an earlier foothold in the Chinese market. The Japanese at this point are still trying to sort out their balance sheets. We'll have an advantage.""
The city-state has already lured many Asian headquarters from Hong Kong either directly, or by luring those companies that might previously more naturally have gone to Hong Kong.
But Singapore should not get too complacent. Lurking on the horizon lies tiger cub Kuala Lumpur, one of Asia's most promising and aggressive financial centres.
Malaysia's political stability, plentiful cheap office space and political will to deregulate financial markets are attractive for multinationals seeking an Asian location.
Malaysia is cheap, dynamic and motivated, with rentals one-third of those in Singapore and one-quarter of Hong Kong's.
""It's very obvious that the infrastructure is being put in place, put in place very rapidly,"" said Patrick Tan, assistant director at ABN Amro Hoare Govett in Kuala Lumpur.
""Right now we're number three (behind Hong Kong and Singapore) but it's a question of time and momentum. It's not a question of how many years but more a question how fast - what sort of volume can be built up in the next couple of years.""
Even Taipei, undeterred by political awkwardness with China, will be watching Hong Kong carefully over the coming months and years for signs of a loss of openness and evenhandedness.
And Jakarta is working hard to build its role as an Asian middleman for international investors.
""Our investment banking industry is growing at the moment and investment banks from the United Kingdom and the U.S. are coming here,"" said Agung Prabowo, analyst with Indonesia's state-owned brokerage PT Danareksa Sekuritas.
""We do play a middleman role that can facilitate the new ideas or debt securities or equity securities, and there are investors here as well who can absorb new issuance.""
HONG KONG THREAT WITHIN NOT WITHOUT
Despite all the enthusiasm, economists warn that China's smooth economic emergence should not be taken for granted.
Growth rates in China are declining as the nation grapples with massive structural problems.
And the sort of problems afflicting Hong Kong also weigh on other regional centres.
""Hong Kong's probably got more or as many well-qualified people as anywhere else in the region, and also, this economy has managed to adapt itself very well over the years,"" said Simon Ogus, economist at SBC Warburg in Hong Kong.
The greatest threat to Hong Kong comes not from outside but within, Ogus warned.
""The key question for Hong Kong is: does the underlying legal regulatory structure under which that (China) business is conducted change. In which case, there will be a loss of competitiveness relative to other countries,"" Ogus said.
"
ScottHillis,"Weeping crowds mourning the death of Deng Xiaoping swamped the hamlet where China's political patriarch was born, prompting authorities to send armed police to keep order, officials said on Friday.
Thousands of mourners flocked to Paifang village in Guang'an county in the southwestern province of Sichuan, some falling to their knees and weeping, said an official at Deng's former residence, now a museum.
""There are a lot of people crying, some of them young, but most of them are older,"" the official said by telephone.
""Some old people have knelt on the ground and wept. Their faces were covered in tears,"" he said.
Deng, architect of market-oriented reforms that transformed China into a rising superpower, passed away on Wednesday night aged 92.
Officials at Deng's old courtyard abode, which normally saw some 100 visitors a day, were unable to handle the flood of people that broke over the hamlet after Deng's death was announced early on Thursday.
""About 3,000 people came here yesterday,"" the official said. ""Today there will be more.""
""It's extremely crowded in here,"" he said. ""Anywhere there is room to stand is crowded with people.""
Officials sent the paramilitary People's Armed Police to maintain order at the museum, which had been converted into a makeshift shrine to Deng, he said.
""Although there are a lot of people, everything is orderly,"" the official said, adding that no incidents had been reported.
A large photograph of Deng hung over the courtyard entrance, crowned by a black banner with white characters reading ""Mourn Deng Xiaoping With Sorrow"", he said.
""One young fellow cried and said 'Without Deng there would not be the happy life of today',"" the official said.
Mourners, many wearing black armbands and holding white, handmade paper flowers, filed past the photograph, bowing or kneeling in front of a table heaped with cypress branches symbolising uprightness and longevity.
Some of those paying their last respects to Deng had come from distant Guangzhou and Shenzhen in the southern province of Guangdong, a booming region that owed its prosperity to his ambitious capitalistic reforms, another museum official said.
""Taxis, shops, hotels...and those who have come to Guang'an for business or as tourists are displaying white flowers to show their grief over Deng Xiaoping,"" the China News Service said.
The outpouring of sadness and reflection in Paifang contrasted with the bustling streets of Beijing, where flags flying at half-mast on the second day of official mourning were the only sign of a break from routine.
The Supreme People's Court, China's top judicial body, ordered all courts to ensure strict law enforcement and to safeguard social stability, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Political transitions in communist China in the past have been fraught with difficulty and the deaths of some previous senior leaders have triggered mass protests.
"
ScottHillis,"Busy Chinese took the death of Deng Xiaoping in their stride on Friday, praising the patriarch for the economic miracles he created but blaming him for social ills such as corruption and unemployment.
The day after the announcement of the passing of the man whose reforms gave Chinese unprecedented freedom, residents in Beijing bustled off to work, street markets buzzed with activity and factories churned out their goods.
""Deng was a great man, people will miss him and appreciate him for greatly improving their living standards in such a short time,"" a retired factory worker said in her home in Beijing.
""It's not something we common people can worry about,"" said a Beijing taxi driver of Deng's passing. ""I still need to make money.""
Deng's 18-year rule, which transformed China from a backward hermit nation into an economic powerhouse, ended on Wednesday night when he died from complications linked to the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. He was 92.
""Deng was a man who changed China's history and guided China into the world from being an isolated country,"" said a former official in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen who abandoned his government post to go into business.
An editor in a state-run publishing house in Beijing said her company would hold an informal discussion session on Deng's ideology on Friday afternoon.
""Just for half a day we will take a look at his spirit and study the thoughts of Deng Xiaoping,"" the editor said.
However, some Chinese said Deng's achievements in freeing China from the collectivist shackles clamped on it by the late Chairman Mao Zedong would be overshadowed by the social ills unleashed by his policies.
""I don't want to totally reject Deng, but Deng set a bad example for China's rulers in the aspect of corruption,"" said a 30-year-old musician in Beijing.
""Deng's family members all get good treatment in society. There must be great changes in China in the future,"" he said.
Market competition created by Deng's reforms had forced the closure of state-run industries in many regions, swelling the ranks of the jobless.
""Many state firms here have collapsed and their officials have no capacity to manage them,"" said one girl, a high school student in Daixingganling in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, a stronghold of socialist industry.
""My parents and I just feel some uncertainty, some worry. We feel no confidence,"" she said by telephone.
Another legacy of Deng, the bloody June 4, 1989, crackdown on student-led demonstrations centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square, would leave a stain on later assessments of the diminutive patriarch.
""They shouldn't have fired their guns on the common people. They should have used peaceful means to solve the situation,"" the publishing editor said.
""History will deliver an accurate judgment,"" she said.
Some doubted that President Jiang Zemin, picked by Deng to assume the mantle of power, had the political mettle to lead China into the 21st century.
""China really needs a powerful leader like Deng to guide it forward,"" said a government clerk in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.
""Although the third generation of leaders is becoming more sophisticated...I'm worried that new leaders may not be so determined in making decisions,"" another businessman in Shenzhen said.
"
ScottHillis,"The South Korean flag on Friday flew at half-mast at Seoul's mission in Beijing where a senior Pyongyang defector is holed up, talks on his fate stalled by the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Chinese and South Korean officials had met on Thursday despite the death of Deng the previous night over what to do with high-level Pyongyang ideologue Hwang Jang-yop, who sought refuge in Seoul's consular compound last week, a Seoul embassy official said.
However, signs emerged that the meeting was aimed at keeping open a channel for dialogue in case of emergency rather than seeking to find a swift solution on the fate of Hwang, Pyongyang's highest level defector, who has been marooned in the mission for 10 days.
The embassy official declined to comment on whether the talks had focused on resolving Hwang's fate and said a solution to the Cold War drama in the Chinese capital was unlikely to come soon due to the death of Deng late on Wednesday.
""It is very hard to say when the situation will be over,"" said an embassy official who declined to be identified.
The death of the North's revolutionary ally Deng was the second blow to Pyongyang from Beijing in a week after Hwang, a senior aide to North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-il, arrived at Seoul's consular office on February 12.
China on Thursday declared six days of mourning for Deng and officials in Seoul said they would temporarily refrain from raising the defection issue with Chinese officials.
""China and South Korea share the same Asian tradition and you just don't want to disturb mourning people,"" a Seoul foreign ministry official said.
The defection of Hwang, ranked 24th in the hierarchy of the secretive Stalinist state, has forced China to walk a diplomatic tightrope between communist ally North Korea and new business partner South Korea.
Officials in Seoul have said a short-term delay in the talks over Hwang would not seriously affect his fate since his departure from Beijing was not imminent.
""The dialogue with China is always operating and we can contact the Chinese side anytime,"" the embassy official said.
A hint at change in Pyongyang's stance on Hwang's flight came on Monday when its Foreign Ministry said it would dismiss Hwang if he defected.
The North had earlier persisted in its claim that South Korea had abducted Hwang, charges dismissed by Seoul as preposterous.
Another official in South Korea said a videotape of Hwang confirming his defection had been passed to Chinese officials before hints emerged that North Korea might be ready to walk away from its fight to get Hwang back.
China appeared wary of Pyongyang's intentions, setting up a police cordon around Seoul's compound and sending three armoured personnel carriers and a riot control truck to guard the approaches to the mission.
On Wednesday, China announced to its people for the first time that Hwang had entered the embassy of South Korea in Beijing, signalling that the Chinese government believed he had gone there of his own free will.
South Korea, in an apparent bid to encourage Pyongyang to end the confrontation, announced on Thursday it would send $6 million in food aid to the North, which is suffering chronic food shortages made worse by devastating floods.

ScottHillis,"For ordinary Chinese, the era of Deng Xiaoping was one in which the government lifted its heavy hand from their daily lives and gave them freedom to move house, change jobs, dress as they pleased and say what they wanted.
Much of the intimate and intrusive control built up under the late chairman Mao Zedong disappeared.
""Getting the government 'off the backs' of average Chinese, in order to free their essential commercial instincts, will be one of Deng's most enduring legacies,"" wrote sinologist David Shambaugh in ""Deng Xiaoping - Portrait of a Chinese Statesman"".
One of the most obvious revolutions was in fashion.
The ubiquitous blue and grey Mao suits that were a symbol of revolutionary purity have been replaced by a rainbow of colours and designs.
Mini-skirts, body-hugging T-shirts, high-heeled shoes and make-up are among the new looks -- fostered by almost racy fashion magazines -- that Chinese women have taken up.
In the years of Maoist fervour a woman risked public criticism, at the very least, if she looked anything but as plain and unexceptional as possible. Perms were banned.
On the cultural front, a diet of revolutionary television soap operas, propaganda movies and anodyne songs about loving the party was spiced up.
Television viewers were offered a taste of foreign soap operas. The U.S. show ""Baywatch"" with its scantily clad female life guards won a following, while home-made films touched on the taboo issue of sex and the stars began to kiss -- although nudity remained off-limits.
Shopping was transformed from a complicated chore in which permits or ration cards were required to buy anything from rice and cakes to a bicycle.
Under Deng, money bought almost anything.
Even housing, for decades one of the most tightly held of state monopolies, came on to the market.
Tens of millions of people began to travel, flooding into cities from the countryside in search of jobs and to set up businesses, living in houses they found for themselves and forcing the police to relax curbs on household registration.
After years of bans and red tape, people just went ahead and moved, throwing themselves on the marketplace to find a job and a home.
A law that banned unmarried couples from staying with each other overnight became a thing of the past.
The intrusive interrogation, and possible punishment, that accompanied a request for an abortion was replaced by a more pragmatic approach. Doctors didn't bother to ask questions.
Divorce became a personal matter and no longer an excuse for employers to call in sparring spouses for lengthy sessions to counsel against breaking up the marriage.
A Chinese unhappy with his work under Mao knew that his was a job for life. Under Deng, an employee could resign and find another job of his choice.
The personal file that charts the life of every Chinese still follows him from post to post. But now, a Chinese has the freedom to place the file with a personnel exchange centre, for a fee, thus expanding the freedom to swap jobs without begging permission from whoever holds the file.
A Chinese can crack jokes at the expense of once sacrosanct leaders without the risk of prison. Freedom to express an opinion exists -- at least in the privacy of one's own home.
But even under Deng these new freedoms have their limits.
One of Deng's slogans was ""seize with both hands"".
While one hand held economic liberalisation in its grasp, the other gripped political control, particularly intolerance of opposition as manifested in the crackdown on student-led protests in June 1989 that exposed the popular threat to the Communist Party's hold on power.
Deng's message was clear: stay out of politics, don't challenge the party and you can do pretty much as you want.
""Under Mao, the rule was: anything that is not permitted is forbidden. Under Deng, it was: anything that is not illegal is allowed,"" said one banker.
"
ScottHillis,"An actor who played Deng Xiaoping in a recent movie release says he wants to avoid being typecast in the golden role now that the Chinese patriarch has exited the earthly stage.
Beijing actor Shi Xin debuted as the late paramount leader in ""Battles for Glory over Taihang Mountains"", an action-packed tale of the diminutive ruler's World War Two exploits which premiered in December.
Since then he has been offered Deng roles in five other films. ""My teachers, classmates and friends all say I'm going to get stuck in this one role,"" Shi, 25, told Reuters.
""I don't think that's right. If the day comes that I can play another role, I will be hardworking and earnest in my acting,"" Shi said.
Deng, one of Chinese communism's greatest revolutionaries as well as its most spectacular reformer, died aged 92 last Wednesday. That was also Shi's 25th birthday.
""At first I really didn't believe it,"" Shi said. ""I feel connected to him in some way.""
Plucked from the Central Drama Institute at age 23 to act the part of Deng, Shi said he found it tough to play the pint-sized patriarch, who despite his larger-than-life status as China's de facto emperor stood just 150 cm (five feet) tall.
""Deng Xiaoping was an incredible, a great man,"" Shi said. ""So when I got this role my heart was very heavy.
""To make the transition to playing such a great man was very difficult and gave me a lot of pressure, because I am so young,"" Shi said.
""My biggest challenge was losing weight,"" the 170-cm (5 ft 8 inch) Shi said. ""For the filming I didn't eat any staple foods. I mostly ate tomatoes and cucumbers.""
To prepare for the most important role of his career, Shi holed up in a classroom where he pored over books and photo albums to glean every detail about Deng's life and times.
""Although everyone felt I did a pretty good job, I still think I lacked a lot,"" he said, but added that the complexity of Deng's peppery persona could entice him into future films.
""Deng Xiaoping is not an average character. Playing him is something I will work on my whole life,"" he said.
Released last December, ""Battles for Glory"" failed even to recoup its shooting costs of just nine million yuan ($1.08 million), one-ninth of which came from central government coffers, said director Qin Yan.
Qin said she hoped Deng's death would rekindle interest in the man who helped lead the Communist Party to victory in 1949 and whose reforms sparked one of the fastest economic booms the world has seen.
Beijing had ordered cinemas across China to interrupt their normal fare of Hong Kong kung fu films and Hollywood blockbusters and instead roll over six films about Deng, including ""Battles for Glory"", Qin said.
""This film now has a mythological aspect to it,"" Qin said. ""We can cherish his memory and remember him through this film.""
Managers at several theatres in the capital were not so sure. They took Deng off their marquees on Saturday in the face of poor customer response to tales of his exploits.
""We sold one ticket,"" one manager said, noting that the same films had been running almost continuously on television since Deng's death was announced.
"
ScottHillis,"In a show that Deng Xiaoping may not have wanted, China's state television gave his 1.2 billion people a lingering last look at the body of their deceased patriarch on Monday as official mourning moved into high gear.
Draped with the crimson hammer-and-sickle flag of Chinese communism and showered with flower petals, the body was shown lying in state at Beijing's 301 Military Hospital as grim-faced leaders and weeping relatives filed past.
Deng, who died on Wednesday aged 92, had expressly forbidden the elaborate public grieving that has attended the deaths of top Chinese leaders in the past.
But China Central Television's main evening newscast, the most widely watched broadcast in the country, effectively overruled him by devoting its main evening news to emotional scenes of farewells to his body before its cremation on Monday.
Pale and puffy, the body was repeatedly shown lying on a bier surrounded by grieving members of China's elite and elaborate funeral wreaths of plastic flowers.
Soviet-trained technocrat President Jiang Zemin, Deng's hand-picked successor, led an official group of mourners that included all members of the ruling Communist Party politburo and other senior government and party leaders.
Jiang, looking ill at ease, shook hands with Deng's weeping family but said nothing. He led the mourners in the three traditional bows of respect to the body and is expected to read the eulogy at official memorial rites in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday.
After a slow and stately funeral cortege to the Babaoshan cemetery where revolutionary veterans are traditionally cremated, Deng's body lying in a glass-topped bier was carried into a final anteroom by an honour guard of eight soldiers..
Sonorous music played in the background as Deng's grey-haired wife, Zhuo Lin, and other family members were shown sobbing and wailing.
One of his three daughters, Deng Nan, bent down to embrace and kiss her father's forehead, clinging to his body. Another daughter, Deng Rong, cried out ""You are not dead!""
The television pictures seemed clearly aimed at stirring an emotional response among the 1.2 billion people Deng ruled for 18 years, but who have shown little open grief at his death last week at the age of 92.
People lining the funeral courtege's route from the hospital to the cemetery -- most of whom were marshalled to attend by their work units -- were shown crying quietly and tenderly affixing white paper flowers of mourning to their jackets.
In sobbing interviews, one after another pledged to honour Deng's memory and to forge ahead with his ideals.
""Scatter Hot Tears for Comrade Xiaoping"" read one banner held by mourners along the route.
"
ScottHillis,"A funeral cortege bearing the body of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping arrived at Beijing's Babaoshan cemetery for cremation on Monday as China began paying last respects to the man who transformed the nation.
A white van bedecked with black and yellow ribbons, the colours of mourning, carried Deng's body at a stately pace on its last journey to the cemetery in western Beijing where Chinese communism's heroes are traditionally laid to rest.
""Scatter Hot Tears for Comrade Xiaoping,"" read a banner with black characters and held up by a group of people outside the military hospital where Deng's body has lain since he died last Wednesday aged 92.
Hundreds of armed police, a fraction of the huge security force activated as China treads carefully along the road of political transition, lined streets along the 2.5-km (1.5-mile) route to the cemetery.
The cortege moved at a pace slightly faster than walking to allow thousands of mourners lining the route a last glimpse of the man who ruled China for 18 years with a unique mixture of capitalist-style policies under communist control.
""I have come to say goodbye to Deng Xiaoping,"" said one young man.
As the cavalcade moved past, people stood on roofs of nearby buildings or climbed up lamp posts for a better view.
But some local residents did not know Deng's body was to be moved on Monday and were upset that their routine was disrupted.
""Hey, move it, some of us have to go to work,"" grumbled one middle-aged woman pushing her bicycle through the crowd.
Outside Babaoshan stood hundreds of workers bused in from from the nearby steel works.
One manager of the giant state-run enterprise, Yue Wenhui, 44, asked why he was willing to wait outside on a wintry day, said: ""The weather is good. It is as cloudy as our hearts.""
Deng, an early opponent of the leadership cult around his predecessor Chairman Mao Zedong, made clear he wanted his death to be followed by more restrained mourning than the near-hysteria that followed Mao's demise in 1976.
No foreign dignitaries have been invited to attend Tuesday's memorial rites, to be held in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. Deng's ashes will be scattered at sea.
State media publicised a request by Deng's family that his body not be put on display, his corneas be donated to an eye bank and his body offered for medical dissection before cremation.
China has sought to present an image of stability and continuity in the aftermath of Deng's death, painfully aware of the tumult that has often followed the death of strongmen throughout China's history.
Since his death authorities have heightened their security watch around the capital and especially in Tiananmen Square, the vast central space where, in 1989, student-led protests were crushed by troops and tanks at Deng's behest.
So far, the public has seen a display of unanimity at the top of China's communist power structure, with the supreme leader's hand-picked successor, Jiang Zemin, vowing to keep China on the road of economic reform.
But Chinese political analysts said cracks were appearing in the facade and Jiang, who holds the top state, party and military posts and is now the most powerful man in China, may be trying to throw his weight around too soon.

ScottHillis,"A funeral cortege bearing the body of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping arrived at Beijing's Babaoshan cemetery for cremation on Monday as China began paying last respects to the man who transformed the nation.
The cortege was led by four black cars followed by a white van bedecked with black and yellow ribbons, the colours of mourning in China, that served as the hearse for Deng's body. The van was flanked by two Red Flag limousines.
Hundreds of armed police lined the streets along the 2.5 km (1.5 mile) route to the cemetery from a military hospital, where Deng's body has lain since he died last Wednesday aged 92.
The cortege of about 30 vehicles moved at a pace slightly faster than walking to allow thousands of mourners lining the route a last glimpse of the man who ruled China for 18 years.
""I have come to say goodbye to Deng Xiaoping,"" said one young man as the cavalcade moved past.
China has sought to present an image of stability and continuity in the sensitive aftermath of the passing of Deng, who transformed China by pursuing capitalist-style reforms while maintaining Communist Party control.

Deng, an early opponent of the leadership cult around his predecessor the late Chairman Mao Zedong, made clear he wanted his death to be followed by more restrained mourning than the near-hysteria that followed Mao's demise in 1976.

ScottHillis,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who assumed supreme power when Deng Xiaoping died last week, on Tuesday delivered the eulogy for the patriarch before 10,000 of the nation's elite in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
His voice breaking, Jiang wiped tears from his eyes. ""The people of China love Comrade Deng Xiaoping... we miss comrade Deng Xiaoping.""
Jiang stood in front of a huge portrait of Deng, beneath which lay a casket containing his ashes, covered with a crimson hammer-and-sickle Communist Party flag.
As the funeral began, sirens and whistles sounded nationwide for three minutes as a mark of respect for the man who brought unprecedented prosperity to the world's most populous nation while keeping tight communist control.
""Grieve in silence,"" Premier Li Peng said, calling the three minutes of mourning as the thousands of Communist Party and government leaders stood to attention, heads bowed.
On the trading floor of the Beijing commodities exchange, traders stood silently with their heads bowed in front of an electronic screen showing live coverage of the funeral, which began at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT).
Chinese police cleared Beijing's Tiananmen Square soon after dawn, throwing a security net over the vast arena that is a potent symbol of China and a focus for expressions of grief as well as demonstrations of anger.
Chinese authorities were determined to prevent a repeat of the student-led demonstrations that convulsed Beijing in 1989 after the death of another Communist Party luminary.
No foreign dignitaries have been invited to the funeral but all eight Chinese television channels beamed the memorial live.
On Monday, television showed China's millions indelible images of their dead leader lying in state, his face pale and puffy, in the presence of solemn political leaders and grief-stricken relatives.
It was just the sort of lingering display of his remains that Deng -- contemptuous of the personality cult around his predecessor Mao Zedong -- had forbidden.
""Deng looked at peace,"" the Xinhua news agency said.
Political analysts questioned however whether the patriarch would have been at ease with the way his successors have handled the delicate transition period.
Funerary music played as China's elite and his grieving family bowed their heads before a huge portrait of Deng on the stage in the main hall.
""Eternal Glory to Comrade Deng Xiaoping who enjoys the love and esteem of the people of the whole party, the whole army and people of all ethnic groups throughout China,"" read a streamer hanging from one huge balcony.
Beijing streets were virtually deserted as citizens watched the ceremony on state television.
"
ScottHillis,"Three time-bombs planted on buses blew up in rapid succession in China's restive far west, killing at least four people and shattering the nation's calm in the delicate aftermath of the death of patriarch Deng Xiaoping.
Police patrolled streets and checked suspicious bags and packages on Wednesday in Urumqi, capital of the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang, following the blasts in the city on Tuesday afternoon.
""I think at least four to five people were killed, including one child who died instantly,"" said a Xinjiang television station official, who declined to be identified.
""People are full of fear, and the city is on high alert,"" said the TV station official.
The blasts, which officials said injured at least 60, occurred within minutes in separate parts of the city, which is the centre of Chinese control over the region and its ethnic Uighur population.
The explosions occurred on the same day as the final rites were being observed in far-off Beijing for Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who strictly enforced the integrity of China against separatist threats.
In an ironic twist, one bomb went off on Tuanjie (Unity) Street. A fourth was found before it detonated, a local government official said without elaborating.
Despite the widespread fear of further unrest, state media in Urumqi and elsewhere in the county have not reported the incidents.
""Everybody knows about it but nothing has been said officialy,"" said a local resident contacted by telephone.
It was the first known violence in Xinjiang, a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan, since anti-Chinese riots in Yining on February 5 and 6 left nine people dead.
No one has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blasts. Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by attacks on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.
Chinese leaders have expressed concern over the threat from Islamic fundamentalism, visiting Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said in Beijing.
""I think we have a very similar view on this,"" he said.
""Every attempt to turn religion into a weapon becomes extremely dangerous, it is something that knows no boundaries,"" Levy said. ""It is like sand, it can be transported by the wind from one place to another.""
Tuesday's bombs exploded at around 6.40 p.m. (1040 GMT). ""People in Urumqi usually finish work at seven, so not too many people were injured or killed,"" the TV official said.
Urumqi residents recounted Tuesday's few minutes of terror.
""The Number 44 bus exploded near the Agricultural Bank,"" said a young Uighur woman. ""A trishaw driver was killed, he was lying on the ground covered with blood.
""All the windows of the bus were broken. Several minutes later, police sealed the spot. Policemen, riot police and armed police could be seen everywhere,"" she added.
""Residents were ordered to stay at home or at their (work) units. We are terrified. Many people go to work by taxi or buses provided by the units,"" she said.
Another bomb wrecked a Number Two bus, tearing off the roof. The third explosion was on a Number 10 bus, but no details were available.
""When I heard the explosion, I felt as if the sky had collapsed,"" said a Uighur witness. ""Many people in the store rushed out to look. I was too terrified to go out.
""Today buses are running again, but there are policemen at every station, they check people and bags,"" the witness said.
""I hate the people making the explosions. Our life is much better than before. I don't understand why they destroy stability and make trouble for ordinary people.""
Number Two buses have been a target before.
""This kind of explosion happened in 1992, I think, as the Number Two bus runs on the major route through downtown,"" said a bus station worker.
"
ScottHillis,"A powerful earthquake struck northwest China on Saturday, killing at least two people and injuring three in an area where about 50 people died in a tremor in January, officials said.
The earthquake measuring 6.0 on the open-ended Richter scale jolted Jiashi county in the northwestern region of Xinjiang at 2.04 p.m. (0604 GMT), an official with the local office of the State Seismological Bureau said.
""It is now known that two people have died and two have been seriously injured,"" the official said. A seismological official in the regional capital of Urumqi said a total of three people had been injured.
The tremor badly frightened the district's residents, many of whom are sheep herders or cotton farmers, and sent people spilling out into the streets, said one official with a local television station.
""It was really strong. Our building and everything in it was rattling, the building shook really fiercely,"" the television official said.
""Everyone ran out of their houses in terror, but most went back inside when it stopped shaking,"" she said, adding that many buildings around her office building had cracked, though none had collapsed.
Many of the area's residents lived in earthen houses that are easily damaged by earthquakes and the casualty toll could rise, the Urumqi official said.
""We're not yet sure how many houses have collapsed. We only know initially that there were maybe more than 1,500 houses,"" the Jiashi official said. ""Houses that are a bit shoddy might be done for now and are not fit to live in,"" she said.
Authorities in Jiashi had started relief activities and aid teams from other parts of Xinjiang were preparing to move in to help, the official in Urumqi said.
""Relief activities are just getting under way,"" he said.
Government officials in Jiashi could not immediately be reached for comment.
The tremor was one of several aftershocks from an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude that caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in Jiashi on January 21, the Jiashi seismological official said.
""This one was much smaller than the last earthquake,"" she said, adding that an aftershock of 5.0 that jostled Jiashi last week had barely been felt.
That aftershock was from a tremor measuring 5.3 earlier in February, she said. No casualties were reported in either of the smaller quakes.
The January earthquake caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in the area and the district has since been rocked by hundreds of aftershocks. More aftershocks were expected, officials said.
"
ScottHillis,"Premier Li Peng said on Saturday China would pursue a foreign policy of opening to the world pioneered by late leader Deng Xiaoping, citing ties with the United States and Europe as of particular importance.
Li, speaking at the start of the annual session of China's National People's Congress, or parliament, placed less emphasis on relations with Japan, China's neighbour and biggest trading partner.
He delivered his speech in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, a Maoist-era auditorium evocative of an earlier, less outward-looking period in communist China's foreign policy.
""China will unswervingly pursue the policy of opening to the outside world...,"" Li said after he and 2,800-odd parliamentary deputies had observed a brief silence for Deng, who died on February 19 aged 92.
""We wish to see further improvement in Sino-U.S. relations and the strengthening of Sino-European relations,"" he said, without going into detail.
China this week marked the 25th anniversary of the Shanghai Communique -- the starting point for the process of normalising Sino-U.S. relations -- by criticising Washington for failing to honour the terms of its agreements.
Relations between China and the United States deteriorated in 1995 and early 1996 due to disputes ranging from Taiwan to pirated software and illegal garbage shipments, and have improved only in recent months.
Both sides seemed happy with this week's visit to Beijing by new U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
Li referred to ties with Japan briefly.
""Sino-Japanese relations were once obstructed. We wish to see a normal development of relations between the two countries,"" he said.
Recent strains between the World War Two foes have included a flare-up in a long-standing dispute, also involving Taiwan and Hong Kong, over ownership of islets called Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese.
Li said China opposed interference in the internal affairs of other countries -- an apparent jab at outsiders who take China to task over its human rights record.
China is to announce on Sunday a 14.7 percent incrrease in its defence budget for 1997, Chinese sources said, but Li said China had no aggressive intentions.
""A developed China will not constitute a threat to any other country,"" he said.
Beijing defends its large increases in military spending by saying the base figure is still low and inflation cuts purchasing power.
China denies charges it is becoming a threat in Asia or to the rest of the world, but its military build-up has caused anxiety among neighbours.
The three-million-strong People's Liberation Army , the biggest in the world, ruffled feathers in the region in March 1996 when it held missile tests and war games close to Taiwan just before the island's presidential election.
"
ScottHillis,"South Korea on Monday hinted that talks with China over the fate of a senior North Korean defector sheltering in Seoul's mission in Beijing could drag on while Beijing is busy with its annual parliament session.
""We didn't get any resolution from the Chinese government so far,"" South Korean Embassy spokesman Chang Moon-ik said of the negotiations over Hwang Jang-yop, the Stalinist nation's top ideologue.
Hwang has been holed up in Seoul's consular compound in Beijing since February 12, surrounded by Chinese police with assault rifles, an anti-riot truck and armoured personnel carriers.
Chang declined to say when a resolution to the Cold War standoff being waged in the Chinese capital could be expected, saying Chinese officials were preoccupied with the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), or parliament.
""I think they are very busy because the national assembly is going on,"" he said, adding that Seoul officials were continuing to maintain contacts with their Chinese counterparts.
In his annual government work report made to the opening session of the congress on Saturday, Chinese Premier Li Peng made no mention of the crisis, but said Beijing hoped for stability on the Korean peninsula.
""The Chinese government has all along attached importance to and worked hard for the maintenance of a stable situation in the Korean peninsula,"" Li said.
The NPC opened on Saturday and is to meet for two weeks.
The new interruption comes shortly after the talks were stalled when China observed six days of mourning for the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Beijing has found itself entangled in the showdown between the rival Koreas and now is trying to resolve the crisis without offending an old communist comrade or a new business partner.
Analysts say China is almost certain to grant Hwang safe passage to Seoul, but wants to help its hermit neighbour save face by being seen to give Pyongyang's concerns due attention.
The defection of Hwang, a senior aide to top leader Kim Jong-Il and the architect of the North's ideology of strict self-reliance, further strained ties between the Koreas. But there have been signs in recent days the crisis may be easing.
Pyongyang, which at first insisted Hwang had been kidnapped by South Korean agents, has since vowed to dismiss the ideologue if he had in fact defected.
Near famine conditions in North Korea and apparent disaffection among some members of the ruling elite has prompted a string of defections in recent months.
In another daring flight from North Korea, a man whose family reportedly fell foul of Pyongyang's communist government arrived at Seoul international airport on Sunday after hiding out in China since October 1992.
Last Thursday, a North Korean woman in her 20s fled barefoot to the South through the heavily mined and guarded Demilitarised Zone that has split the Korean peninsula since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
Adding to an impression of instability, the country's defence minister and his deputy died in quick succession last month, and the prime minister was replaced.
"
ScottHillis,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin, seeking to ensure his grip on power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, called on the army on Tuesday to obey only the ruling Communist Party.
The People's Liberation Army, whose backing Jiang needs to ensure political control, should toe the party line, Jiang told a meeting of army delegates to the National People's Congress, or parliament.
""On this vital political issue that concerns the future and destiny of the party, the state and the nation, there must not be the slightest ambiguity or vacillation,"" the official Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as saying.
Jiang, who also holds the posts of Communist Party chief and chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, never served in the armed forces and has tried hard to win army support to bolster his position as Deng's political heir.
Deng died on February 19 aged 92.
Jiang has since moved to cement his position as China's supreme ruler, urging the nation to rally around the party with him at its core.
On Tuesday, Jiang called on army members of parliament to ""seek no fame, status and promotion (and) give priority to the party"", Xinhua said.
""Our army has always followed what the party says,"" he told the meeting, which was attended by generals Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wan'nian and Chi Haotian. All of them are vice-chairmen of the military commission while Chi also serves as defence minister.
Jiang told his audience that the party's leadership had enabled military victories of the past and made the armed forces stronger.
But he said the drive to modernise the three million strong army had created a range of problems and warned officers not to step outside the law while performing their duties.
""Cadres at various levels must run the army with strict discipline and according to law and do their routine ideological and managerial work in a meticulous way,"" he said.
The army that ushered in nearly five decades of communist rule has benefited immensely from capitalist-style reforms launched by Deng in the late 1970s, running luxury hotels, factories and dealing in real estate.
Told by Beijing to make money for itself to supplement its budget, the army has also been widely accused of smuggling and other official abuses of power in its drive to do so.
China has set a defence budget of 80.6 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) this year, a rise of 12.7 percent over actual spending for 1996.
Western military analysts say total defence spending is considerably higher than the published figures.
Beijing defends its hefty increases in military spending by saying the base figure is still low and inflation has cut buying power.
"
ScottHillis,"China on Thursday hinted at ethnic unrest in Moslem Xinjiang as a senior official called for unity in the western region that was rocked by separatist bomb attacks last week.
""Xinjiang ...must further improve ethnic unity, protect social stability and do a better job of building up Xinjiang,"" the official People's Daily quoted Vice-Premier Li Lanqing as saying.
Li made no direct reference to the series of deadly bombings in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi on February 25, the day Beijing held funeral rites for late leader Deng Xiaoping.
The Chinese vice premier's remarks to Xinjiang delegates at the National People's Congress, or parliament, were one of the few signs in the national media that the region had once again been shaken by ethnic unrest.
Chinese police have arrested at least 20 ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi and Yining near Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan, exiled Uighur nationalists said from the Kazakh capital of Almaty.
""At least 20 ethnic Uighurs have been arrested...but the real number may be even higher because we have no information whether new arrests took place last night,"" Kakharman Khozhamberdi, head of a local Uighur association, told Reuters in Almaty.
Officials and residents in Urumqi and Yining, contacted by telephone from Beijing, were unaware of the total number of people arrested in the attacks.
Three bombs hidden on public buses blew up within minutes of each other in Urumqi on February 25 in an apparently coordinated attack. A fourth bomb failed to explode.
The Xinjiang Daily said on Wednesday that authorities had arrested several people suspected of planting bombs and of selling detonators used in the attacks that killed nine people and wounded 74.
Police were interrogating the suspects and had launched a manhunt for others still at large, the regional newspaper said.
China's official media outside the Moslem region ignored the incident.
Moslem separatists say they want to set up an independent ""East Turkestan"" in Xinjiang, a region that is home to many Turkic-speaking people such as the Uighur ethnic minority.
Exiled Uighur nationalists have claimed responsibility for the latest attacks.
Parliament's vice-chairman Wang Hanbin on Thursday introduced revisions to China's criminal law setting stiffer punishment for stirring up ethnic hatred and making it a capital crime to use race or religion to endanger state security.
""People in some places are stirring up hatred among ethnic groups in an attempt to undermine unity among them,"" Wang told parliament.
In early February, an anti-Chinese riot erupted in Yining, about 50 km (31 miles) from Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan. Chinese officials said nine people were killed.
The riot was one of the largest, most violent demonstrations for independence in Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.
Beijing, unnerved by the spectre of turmoil along its borders, had put the Lanzhou Military Region, which oversees Xinjiang, on alert against further unrest, Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily newspaper said on Wednesday.
"
ScottHillis,"China on Thursday hinted at ethnic unrest in Moslem Xinjiang as a senior official called for unity in the western region that was rocked by separatist bomb attacks last week.
""Xinjiang ...must further improve ethnic unity, protect social stability and do a better job of building up Xinjiang,"" the official People's Daily quoted Vice-Premier Li Lanqing as saying.
Li made no direct reference to the series of deadly bombings in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi on February 25, the day Beijing held funeral rites for late leader Deng Xiaoping.
Li's remarks to Xinjiang delegates at the National People's Congress, or parliament, were one of the few signs in the national media that the region had once again been shaken by ethnic unrest.
Three bombs hidden on public buses blew up within minutes of each other in Urumqi in an apparently coordinated attack. A fourth bomb failed to explode.
The Xinjiang Daily said on Wednesday that authorities had arrested several people suspected of planting the bombs and of selling detonators used in the attacks that killed nine people and wounded 74.
Police were interrogating the suspects and had launched a hunt for others still at large, the regional newspaper said.
Official media outside the region ignored the incident.

ScottHillis,"At least two people were killed and about 30 taken to hospitals when a bomb exploded on a public bus in Beijing during rush hour on Friday, Chinese sources and officials said.
The explosion occurred in Beijing's western shopping district of Xidan at around 6:30 p.m. (1030 GMT), engulfing a bus in flames and sending passengers scrambling to escape, a witness said.
""There was a great flame and a 'boom' sound and then people jumped out of the bus,"" a young man who was working nearby at the time of the blast said.
""One woman came out with her hair on fire.""
A Chinese source said at least two people were killed in the bomb blast.
Workers at an emergency centre near the bustling commercial area said they had picked up about 30 injured people and sent them to various hospitals for treatment.
A young man who said he saw the explosion blow the windows out of the back of the bus reported seeing about nine people seriously hurt.
A police official said that some people were suffering from burns but he declined to give further details.
The motive was not immediately known and it was unclear if police had made any arrests.
China's state media regularly report on bombings, arson and other violent attacks by disgruntled workers or jilted lovers.
The bombing followed a string of similar attacks by Moslem separatists in the far western region of Xinjiang.
Three bombs planted on buses blew up within minutes of each other on February 25 in the region's capital of Urumqi in an attack apparently coordinated to coincide with funeral rites in Beijing for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
A fourth bomb failed to explode.
Authorities had arrested seven suspects in the attacks that killed nine people and wounded 74, according to a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong.
One Beijing resident said witnesses told him police, ambulances and fire trucks had rushed to the scene of the explosion on Friday.
The wreckage of the bus was quickly towed away, and police cordoned off the area for about one hour.
Several hours later, broken glass was still scattered on the street as uniformed and plainclothes police patrolled nearby.
Police had set up check points around the capital and were stopping cars, checking identification of drivers and searching vehicles.
Exiled Uighur nationalists in neighbouring Kazakhstan claimed responsibility for the Xinjiang bombings and for a similar, previously unreported attack near the Kazakh border on Monday.

"
ScottHillis,"China has vowed to smash plots aimed at disrupting stability in Xinjiang after a spate of bomb attacks which shook the far western region last month.
Illegal religious groups and ethnic separatists were the main forces working to undermine social stability in the mostly Moslem region, said a commentary in the Xinjiang Daily seen in Beijing on Tuesday.
""We must maintain a high degree of vigilance for that very small number of bad people who endanger the security of the state and the public, jeopardise social stability and engage in violent terrorist activities,"" the commentary said in the official newspaper's March 5 edition.
""Just let them show their heads and we will... foil their plots and strike at their puffed-up arrogance,"" it said.
The prominent front-page commentary followed a series of bomb attacks that killed nine and wounded 74 in the restive region last week.
Three bombs planted on buses blew up within minutes of each other in the regional capital Urumqi on February 25 in an attack apparently coordinated to coincide with funeral rites in Beijing for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
A fourth bomb failed to explode.
Another bomb blew up a bus in Beijing last week during rush hour, killing at least two people and injuring 30, but Chinese officials said on Monday there was no evidence linking the deadly blast with the Urumqi attacks.
The newspaper made no mention of any bombings but quoted a senior central government official from Xinjiang as saying authorities would win the battle against those who sought to destroy national unity.
""We have resolute faith in our victory over ethnic splittist activities,"" the newspaper quoted Ismail Amat, Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, as saying.
""There is no opportunity for splittist activities, which go against the tide of history and the wishes of peoples of all ethnic groups,"" Amat said. ""Failure is inevitable.""
The Xinjiang Daily said last Wednesday an unspecified number of suspects were in custody for having made and planted the bombs, while others were thought to have sold detonators for the explosives.
Exiled Uighur nationalists in the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan claimed responsibility last week for the bombings and said Chinese police had arrested at least 20 ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi and Yining near Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan.
Chinese officials declined to comment on the arrests in the Xinjiang bombings, saying only that authorities were investigating.
""We are in the process of solving it,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a regular news briefing on Tuesday.

ScottHillis,"Talks in Beijing on the fate of a senior Pyongyang defector have made progress but have not clinched a deal despite a personal bid by North Korea's foreign minister to break the deadlock.
""There has been some headway. Negotiations are still going on,"" Chang Moon-ik, spokesman for the South Korean embassy in Beijing, said on Tuesday about talks on Hwang Jang-yop, who sought refuge in Seoul's Beijing consulate four weeks ago.
Hwang, a senior North Korean ideological theoritician and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il, has been stranded in the consular compound since February 12 while the three nations negotiate his fate.
Officials in South Korea said on Monday they expected a breakthrough this week in talks with China aimed at securing Hwang's passage out of Beijing, but Chang said it was unlikely he would be moved in the next few days.
""Final arrangements have yet to be done... There has been no final decision,"" Chang said by telephone.
China said on Tuesday that North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam visited Beijing last Saturday in what analysts said was an apparent bid by Pyongyong to break the three-way deadlock.
Hwang, chief architect of Pyongyang's ruling ideology of Juche, or self-reliance, is the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai played down Kim's visit, saying he was only passing through the Chinese capital on his way to Africa and his trip ""did not touch on any special problem"".
Weeks of talks over Hwang's fate, interrupted by the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month, have failed to produce an accord as Beijing finds itself torn between an old communist ally and a new capitalist friend.
Analysts say Hwang will likely end up in Seoul but Beijing is anxious to help North Korea save face by being seen to give due consideration to the hermit nation's concerns.
""We want to bring Mr Hwang to Seoul directly but if that is not possible we can make other arrangements,"" embassy spokesman Chang said. Korean sources have said Hwang may be whisked away to another country, possibly in Southeast Asia.
Armed Chinese police backed by armoured personnel carriers and a crowd control truck maintained a tight security cordon around Seoul's consular compound, in Beijing's normally sedate diplomatic quarter, where Hwang is holed up.
Beijing has appealed to North and South Korea to stay calm during attempts to end the diplomatic standoff sparked by Hwang's defection.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week Beijing was still investigating Hwang's case and hoped for a solution as soon as possible.
North Korea initially accused the South of kidnapping Hwang, then changed its hardline stance by saying that if he really had defected he was a traitor and would be dismissed.
Beijing, which sent its armies to fight on Pyongyang's side during the 1950-1953 Korean War, established diplomatic links with Seoul only in 1992.

SimonCowell,"Lloyd's of London confirmed on Friday it is to abandon 300 years of self-regulation and recommend supervision be handed over to an external authority.
The insurance market's ruling body, the Council of Lloyd's, has endorsed the findings of a working party set up in October 1996 to review the existing regulatory system.
The proposals include bringing Lloyd's more into line with other regulated markets and narrowing the gap in treatment between it and insurance companies.
The Council would retain day-to-day responsibility for regulation but be subject to external oversight by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
Lloyd's is to ask the government to amend both the Insurance Companies Acts and the Financial Services Act to bring in the additional external accountability.
It has yet to discuss the proposals with the Labour government which is expected to carry out a thorough review of all financial services regulation in coming months. That review is likely to include Lloyd's.
The government has previously indicated that it favours centralising financial regulation into one body rather than the current division of responsibility between Self-Regulatory Organisations supervised by the SIB.
Today's proposals would effectively make the Council something akin to an SRO and so could be overtaken by events if the government goes ahead with the shake-up of regulation.
The changes themselves, if approved, could take up to two years to implement.
In the meantime the report suggests Lloyd's mirror best practice elsewhere in the financial sector with the assistance of a representative from the SIB.
A spokesman said the SIB would give careful consideration to the proposals but that the legislation needed to implement them was a matter for the government.
The report says powers enabling the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to assume direct responsibility for supervising Lloyd's members if they fail solvency tests should be widened to bring them more into line with those relating to insurance companies.
This would include allowing the DTI to sequester the assets and freeze the bank accounts of Lloyd's members if they were to default.
External regulators would set out the regulatory principles, approve the market's rules and review and monitor the Council's performance.
Lloyd's said such a move would reinforce confidence that the interests of policyholders and members are sufficiently safeguarded and that the Council is objectively discharging its responsibility to ensure a properly regulated and solvent market.
Sir Alan Hardcastle, chairman of Lloyd's regulatory Board who headed up the review, said it was in the collective interest that the market was ""solvent, fair, stable and clean"".
Other recommendations backed by the Council include cutting the size of the present Regulatory Board from 18 to 12 with one third drawn from the market, one third from external members of the Council and one third independent members.
Regulatory complexity is also to be addressed together with a review of Lloyd's rule book of bylaws and regulations.
A greater proportion of regulatory costs would in future be recovered from firms rather than wholly from members' subscriptions as at present.
The 14-member working group was set up last year in the wake of the 'Reconstruction and Renewal' (R&amp;R) rescue package which saved the market from collapse threatened by huge losses run up between 1988 and 1992.
The panel included representatives from within Lloyd's and the wider financial services industry.
"
SimonCowell,"British composite insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Group Plc on Tuesday gave the green light to a planned share buyback as the company reported a sharp increase in profits for the first quarter of 1997.
But in the absence of any major positive surprises, shares gave only a muted reaction to the news, slipping back 7-1/2 pence to 482 pence pence by late morning.
Pre-tax operating profits for the first three months of the year rose 24 percent to 195 million pounds ($320.6 million), helped by a fall in weather related costs in the United States.
Royal Sun said it remained on target to achieve at least the 175 million pounds of cost savings identified at the time of last year's merger and with the results now out of the way the buyback of five percent of the shares approved at the annual meeting would go ahead.
""We're now in a position that brokers can start to move into the market to do the buyback. How long it will take is just a matter of timing and it's something we're discussing closely with our brokers,"" chief executive Richard Gamble told Reuters.
While a 34 million pound fall in weather-related costs boosted U.S. general business profits to 51 million pounds, a near two thirds rise in UK subsidence took the shine off the British results.
The 10 million pound rise in subsidence more than accounted for the five million pound drop in British profits to 50 million pounds.
""Subsidence is a worry. The good news is the recent rain but it has been one of driest winters on record following on from other dry periods,"" said Gamble.
""We do anticipate subsidence is going to be with us for some time to come but that is being built into the cost of household insurance.""
Analysts said views on the stock largely depended on assessments of the pace of progress in integrating operations.
Repeating a ""hold"" recommendation on the stock, Tim Young at brokerage SocGen warned it may drag out longer than some expect.
""It is a huge task integrating the two groups and that makes us cautious for the short term,"" Young said. ""I find it difficult to see how it can operate as a truly integrated unit before 1999.""
At Lehman Brothers, analyst Rob Procter said good news on the integration progress should emerge through the next 12 months.
""They are likely to beat their cost savings targets and the share buyback could be the first of many,"" Procter said.
Following last year's six billion pound merger of Royal Insurance with Sun Alliance Insurance, Gamble said the reduction in staff numbers would accelerate in 1997.
By the end of March some 1,500 people had left the company and together with properties vacated, annualised savings are so far running at 44 million pounds.
The merger had not affected the group's ability to pick up new business nor retention levels which, said Gamble, were holding up to expected levels.
Echoing remarks made by competitors last week, the company said the rating environment had become more realistic with a succesful four percent increase in motor market rates implemented last autumn.
Royal Sun is to continue to keep an eye on opportunities for small acquisitions such as the recent 46 million pound purchase of Prudential's Italian life assurance and pensions business, but is not actively pursuing larger acquisitions.
""We're not aggressively in the market. Money is not burning a hole in our pocket - that's the indication given by the share
"
SimonCowell,"Around three million members of British insurer Norwich Union will be able to buy shares at a 10 percent discount in a planned offering ahead of the company's flotation on June 16.
Norwich is to raise 1.75 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) of fresh capital in the offering and up to a further 670 million pounds to fund cash payments to its half million overseas members.
The company has also increased its estimate of the price of the new shares.
They are now expected to be sold at between 240 pence and 290 pence. The group's brokers Kleinwort Benson had previously given a guide price of between 220 pence and 265 pence.
Members of the insurance group, Britain's third largest with seven million customers worldwide, are to be offered extra shares at a fixed discount of 25 pence.
A member is someone who holds a Norwich life insurance, pension or annuity policy. Holders of non-life policies such as house contents or car insurance do not qualify.
Members will also receive around 1.3 billion free shares worth around 3.4 billion pounds under flotation plans already announced.
Under the new forecasts, the value of the 300 shares minimum allocation to with-profits policyholders will increase by at least 60 pounds and could be worth as much as 870 pounds.
Members will receive additional shares based on the value and length of time they have held their policies.
The company said it expected to be valued at between 4.9 and 5.6 billion pounds on flotation which would put it in the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest quoted companies.
Norwich chairman George Paul said the company was keen to encourage members to continue to participate in the future of the group.
""I hope that they will take advantage of this opportunity to buy further shares at a 25p discount,"" said Paul.
Alan Bridgewater, Norwich's chief executive, said they were expecting widespread interest in the offer.
Norwich members wishing to take part in the public offering will have to apply for a minimum of 400 pounds worth of shares. There will be an upper ceiling on applications by members of 100,000 pounds.
At least 800 million pounds worth of shares have been reserved to meet applications from members. This may be increased by clawing back 400 million pounds worth of shares from the public offering in the event of strong demand.
The final members' offer price will be announced on June 15 and will be used to determine how many shares succesful applicants receive.
Mini-prospectus and application forms are to be sent to members today. The deadline for receipt of applications is June 10.
Around 1.5 billion pounds of the money raised will go into the policyholders' life fund while the excess, less the 120 million pound cost of flotation, will be used for corporate purposes. ($ = 0.604 British Pounds)

SimonCowell,"Insurance market Lloyd's of London will have to wait to find out the implications for it of Tuesday's announcement of a shake-up in Britain's financial services regulatory system.
No decision has yet been reached about where Lloyd's will fit into the new regulatory regime which will see the existing system of self-regulatory organisations (SROs) swept away and replaced by a Securities and Investments Board (SIB) with tougher new powers and an extended remit.
Only last week the insurance market announced it favoured giving up 300 years of self regulation for supervision by an external authority, specifically the SIB.
A Treasury spokesman described the Labour government as ""sympathetic"" to the proposals but said that no decision had yet been taken.
""There are a number of areas - Lloyds, building societies, insurance more generally - which are still under discussion as to how they are going to be handled under these new arrangements. We'll have to wait to see how those discussions proceed,"" said the spokesman.
Lloyd's has yet to talk to the government about its proposals which would bring it more into line with other regulated markets and narrow the gap in treatment between it and insurance companies.
Under the plans the Council would retain day-to-day responsibility for regulation but be subject to external oversight by the SIB and Department of Trade and Industry.
The changes would need legislation to be brought forward to amend both the Insurance Companies Acts and the Financial Services Act.
The government is likely to want all parties involved to take part in discussions and a Lloyd's spokesman said it would be ""happy to do so"".
"
SimonCowell,"The Treasury may well take over regulation of insurance companies from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) under the Labour government's plans for sweeping reform of Britain's financial services, industry observers said on Thursday.
Spokesmen for both the DTI and Treasury said that no decision had yet been made on the changes, but that this could form part of the new government's shake-up of financial regulation.
Such a move would bring insurance into line with the rest of the financial services sector.
""If the Treasury is responsible for all other aspects of regulation of insurance it would be only sensible,"" said one industry executive.
The steady erosion of the boundaries between insurance and banking industries has also increased the pressure to bring the supervisory regimes closer together.
Many banks are beginning to offer insurance products while insurers are increasingly providing services such as savings facilities, personal loans and mortgages.
At present the DTI regulates insurance companies,  ensuring they are financially sound and meet solvency requirements. Regulation of products is separate.
General insurance is regulated by an industry code of practice and life products by the Financial Services Act, which is to be replaced by fresh legislation arising out of framework reforms announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown on Tuesday.
While British insurers may have given a cautious welcome to the announcement of the regulatory shake-up, they have, as yet, little information on how far the government will go. But many in the industry admit the logic of doing away with the current multi-tiered system.
The creation of a single statutory body, a Securities and Invesments Board (SIB) with enhanced powers and extended remit, could reduce costs, improve transparency and clarify uncertainties which have developed under the present set-up where insurers may be regulated by several different watchdogs.
It could also give a much needed boost to public confidence, after a series of scandals typified by the pension mis-selling of the late 1980s and early 1990s which have undermined public perceptions of the sector.
Britain's financial services market operates on the principle of ""buyer beware"", with regulators focusing on the solvency of practitioners.
The market is left to regulate product suitability, with consumers having to shop around for a good deal. As the pensions mis-selling scandal showed, this was a less than perfect system from the customer's point of view.
Both the SIB and the Personal Investments Authority (PIA), the self regulatory organisation currently responsible for the industry, have come in for severe criticism of their handling of the scandal.
Hundreds of thousands of people were wrongly advised to take out personal pensions rather than stay in company or other occupational schemes and many have yet to receive compensation.
Underlining the problems that have beset the sector in recent years a leaked draft report from the SIB on Wednesday accused Britain's largest life insurer, Prudential Corp of mis-selling financial products and wrongly advising clients to put money into one of its most popular products, The Prudential Savings Account.
While insurers acknowledge the benefits of dealing with a single regulator, there are fears that the government may introduce tighter controls on products and selling.
Only last week, Britain's National Consumer Council called for urgent and wholesale reform of insurance law to ""drag it into the 21st century and redress the balance for consumers"".
A Treasury spokesman said it was too early to say whether detailed legislation on the selling of products would be included in the reform.
With the private sector likely to play a larger part in the provision of pensions in the future, tighter regulation would seem to fit in with the government's long term plans, said industry observers.
"
SimonCowell,"Nearly eight million members of Britain's largest mortgage lender, the Halifax Building Society, are in-line to pocket hundreds of pounds more than originally expected when it floats on the London stock market on June 2.
If betting at London financial bookmakers is near the mark, the basic handout of 200 shares will be worth around 1,400 pounds ($2,270), way ahead of predictions when the flotation was first announced.
The average payout would be 2,170 pounds, nearly 900 pounds more than the Halifax's initial forecasts in January.
Bookmakers, City Index and IG Index, are quoting the Halifax closing price on its first day of trading at 695-705 pence.
That would value the group which converts to a bank on flotation at over 17-1/2 billion pounds and rank it among Britain's largest dozen companies.
In January, the Halifax estimated the shares would be priced at between 390 and 450 pence and in April put a 415 pence 'floor' value on the shares sold on flotation through its free dealing service.
""We opened the Halifax at 660 to 670 pence yesterday. It was very difficult to find people to sell it at that price and it looks as though it's going to be dragged a bit higher,"" said IG Index's Peter Hetherington.
Around two-thirds of Halifax members will receive the basic 200 shares windfall. Members will receive additional shares based on the level of savings.
The maximum allocation for those who can claim for a mortgage account and savings account will now be worth just under 10,000 pounds.
Forecasts of the size of handout have risen steadily since the original announcement of the flotation.
A downward revision in the number of qualifying members gave an initial boost to the figure and the performance of financial stocks since has helped drag the price higher.
The success of the Alliance and Leicester flotation in April has added to expectations of strong demand for Halifax shares. Alliance shares rose sharply on the first days of trading as institutional investors scrambled for stock.
That experience and the subsequent strength of the shares is likely to tempt many Halifax members to hold onto their handouts, at least initially.
""On fundamentals it's unlikely it's worth seven pounds but built into that price is a big chunk of scarcity premium,"" said one banking analyst.
""The concern is that there isn't going to be a lot of supply around and whatever there is will come out largely in one auction. That's where institutions are going to get their stock ... and they'll only get one shot at it."" ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

SimonCowell,"Britain's Scottish Amicable on Thursday defended the multi-million pound fees paid to banking advisers as part of its 2.87 billion pound ($4.7 billion) takeover by life insurer Prudential Corp.
The comments came as ScotAm, based in the Scottish city of Stirling, published details of the proposed transfer of business to the Pru and benefits to policyholders as part of the acquistion plans.
A policyholder circular outlining the proposals will be mailed to members over the next week. The plans have to be approved by voting members at a special general meeting to be held on June 27.
Gavin Stewart, general manger of the Scottish-based mutual insurer, admitted the cost of the deal, estimated at 34 million pounds, was a lot of money but said it was important to get things right.
It was always expensive to demutualise, he said, and had to be seen in the context of similar moves by building socities.
Norwich Union recently put the costs of its  plans to drop mutual status and its five billion pound flotation next month at 120 million pounds.
The amounts paid by ScotAm covered not only advisory fees for bankers SBC Warburg but all the logistical costs of posting circulars to more than a million policyholders and holding special meetings, said Stewart.
Around 1.1 million members stand to receive cash payments averaging 550 pounds and a total package of 1,450 pounds once additional bonuses to policies are taken into account.
All qualifying with-profits members will receive a fixed cash payment of 250 pounds with a further variable amount based on the size and duration of the policy.
Assuming ScotAm gets the necessary approval of three-quarters of members' who vote and the go-ahead from the Court of Session in Edinburgh, it hopes to pay cash and bonuses shortly after the completion of the deal on September 30.
""We're convinced this is an excellent deal for policyholders. 600 million pounds is being paid out in cash and one billion pounds as added value in bonuses on to policies - about half now and half added to policies when they pay out,"" said Stewart.
""We think policyholders when they see the deal will recognise the value and will be pleased to vote for it.""
In all, the cash and bonus payments amount to 1.6 billion pounds. In addition, the Pru is to inject 1.3 billion pounds of financial support to enable increased investment freedom for the ScotAm with profits fund, enhancing the potential for better returns.
ScotAm policies are to be transferred to the Pru and held in a dedicated fund, serviced from ScotAm's headquarters.
The Pru beat off rival offers from Abbey National and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) to win control of ScotAm and reinforce its position as Britain's number one fund manager.
The poilcyholders circular will lay out details of the rejected Abbey and AMP bids.
ScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart said the bidding process had produced a high value for the business and a full distribution of the assets in the with-profits fund to with-profits policyholders.
""The members of ScotAm now have the opportunity to vote for a package which will provide additional financial security and the prospect of improved future investment returns leading to enhanced payouts,"" said chairman Stewart. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)

SimonCowell,"Insurance broker C.E. Heath announced late on Friday that senior management were in advanced talks about a possible buyout of the company for just under 100 million pounds ($163.7 million).
That would value the shares at 143 pence each, a premium of 63 percent over the day's opening price, Heath said shortly after the close of the stock market.
Management involved in the possible offer include group chief executive John Mackenzie Green, according to a source close to the talks.
Meanwhile, non-executive directors are considering the approach.
Over three million shares changed hands in the course of the day ahead of the late afternoon announcement. It was the unusually high stock activity which forced the company to release the news early, the source said.
The success of a bid hinges on fund management group PDFM, which owns 22 percent of Heath, Hambros, which holds 13 percent, Fidelity, with a 13 percent stake and Equitable Life with just under five percent.
In the past Heath was an underwriter, broker and computer services business.
The strategy over the last five years has been to sell underwriting businesses and demerge computer services leaving a pure, medium sized broker in the hope of making the company more attractive to investors.
Over the last year, however, the whole sector has been depressed with market conditions difficult as intense competition squeezed margins.
""Management launched a major reorganisation but the argument is that its very difficult to carry out a restructuring in the full glare of the market place,"" said the source.
Analysts said that a bid from another broker was a possibility but the difficulty was getting the right people to stay with the company.
""The main problem is that the company is the people...There would be other brokers who would be interested if they could get the right people to stay on board,"" said one.

SimonCowell,"Lloyd's of London on Friday posted profits of over one billion pounds ($1.6 billion) for the second year running -- but warned that profits would fall for at least the next two years.
The insurance market, which last year only just succeeded in pushing through a rescue package after the billions of pounds of losses run up between 1988 and 1992, also said its future focus would be on customers.
""For too long, Lloyd's has been obsessed with its capital base. We need to get back to basics,"" said Chief executive Ron Sandler.
That meant providing customers with the best service and developing international trading opportunities, he said.
Lloyd's results are reported three years in arrears and for 1994, profits once again topped the billion pound mark at 1.01 billion pounds.
That fell just short of 1993's record level of 1.08 billion pounds and was in line with forecasts.
Corporate members, who were introduced to the market in 1994 following the near-disastrous losses which threatened to sink Lloyd's, will share in today's profits for the first time.
Corporate capital now provides some 44 percent of the market's capacity, a figure that is forecast to increase further in the future.
Sandler described the 1994 results as ""extremely satisfactory"" but said that there was no sign of an end to the downward trend in premium rates.
That decline, a product of competition in insurance markets worldwide, is expected to have a significant impact on profits in the next few years.
An aggregate of individual syndicate forecasts suggests profits will fall to around 900 million pounds in 1995 and 600 million in 1996.
The 1995 figure is ahead of projections made this time last year despite the adverse movement in currencies but the slide in rates is expected to take its toll in subsequent years.
Lloyd's chairman Sir David Rowland admitted 1997 results would be under pressure from the decline and said he hoped brokers would ""sit on their hands when offered business at crazy rates"".
The 1994 figures were a result of generally good market conditions and the exercise of much sharpened skills in pricing and the setting of terms by Lloyd's underwriters, he said.
They were also helped because of fewer catastrophes, he added, though currency effects reduced profits by around 100 million pounds.
Lloyd's returned to profit 12 months ago following five years of record losses totalling more than eight billion pounds.
Those losses were reinsured into a separate company, Equitas, a central plank in Lloyd's ""reconstruction and renewal"" plan which ensured the 300-year old insurance market's survival.
The reinsurance of 1992 and prior liabilities had transformed Lloyd's position, Sandler said, and clients could be confident that Lloyd's security ranked alongside the best in the world.
Final proposals for further strengthening the market's financial security which will include increasing the amount of capital that Names -- the traditional backers of the market -- have to put up to back their underwriting, are expected to be published next week.
Lloyd's is continuing its efforts to recover around 600 million pounds of debts owed by Names who have refused to meet their losses.
Rowland said it was impossible to give an estimate of how much Lloyd's thought it could collect, but said it would be a substantial sum of money.
Litigation in the U.S. and Britain was unlikely to prove problematic and the amount recovered would depend ultimately on the assets of the Names involved, he added. ($ = 0.610 British Pounds)

SimonCowell,"Britain's top financial regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) on Thursday launched a 400,000 pound ($654,000) advertising campaign designed to heighten the public's awareness of the review into pensions mis-selling.
Under the banner, ""Have You Lost Out On Your Pension?"", the campaign seeks to underline the importance of the public playing its part in the review.
The advertisements will be carried in the national press between Thursday and Sunday this week.
The move has been timed to coincide with the mailing of questionnaires by firms to people who have potentially been mis-sold pensions.
""It is vital that investors respond to the questionnaire, even if they are unable to provide all the information asked for. Otherwise, their case cannot be resolved speedily,"" the SIB said in a statement.
Just two weeks ago regulators moved to speed up compensation payments to victims of pension misselling by banks and insurance companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Companies involved have been given an ultimatum to  settle outstanding cases in an effort to speed up the process and complete it by the end of next year.
As many as 1-1/2 million people may have been wrongly advised to take out personal pensions instead of staying in occupational schemes.
A review was launched in 1994 but recent figures show that so far only around 50,000 assessments have been completed out of the 570,000 cases currently for review.
A total 102 million pounds has been paid out in 12,650 cases where redress has been accepted, around 8,000 pounds each. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds) Thursday, 29 May 1997 14:02:56 ENDS  nFLLUIT1AF

SimonCowell,"Lanica Trust Limited, the investment vehicle run by 31 year old Andrew Regan confirmed on Monday it had lost over 600,000 pounds ($981,000) in its failed attempt to win control of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS).
And the company said its shares, suspended in February after news of its interest in the Co-op leaked to the press, would not be relisted until legal proceedings pending against Regan and business partner David Lyons had been resolved.
Lanica shares were suspended on February 10 at 19-1/2 pounds after soaring from just 137 pence at the end of October.
A spokeswoman for the London Stock Exchange said that there were a number of ""unresolved issues"" surrounding the company.
Lanica's ambitious plans to bid 1.2 billion pounds for the Co-op crumbled in April amid a flurry of legal writs following allegations of the theft of confidential Co-op documents and financial irregularities in an earlier Regan deal.
The circumstances surrounding the planned Co-op takeover won it an unprecedented ""unreserved"" public apology and substantial cash settlement from Regan's merchant bank Hambros.
A preliminary hearing of the private prosecution for theft and handling stolen property brought by the Co-op against Regan was last week adjourned until June 18.
The Serious Fraud Office is currently investigating a transaction between the Co-op and Hobson Group, then headed by Regan, back in January 1995.
Lanica said that it had made a loss of 381,045 pounds last year, compared with a 578,456 profit a year earlier.
The loss included the write-off of Lanica' entire 600,000 pound investment in Galileo Group, the company specially set up to make the Co-op bid.
Regan intended to break-up the Co-op, selling off constituent parts of the group whose interests range from supermarkets, banking and insurance to opticians, chemists and funeral parlours.
Following the failure of the bid, Galileo was put into liquidation. The liquidators, Ernst &amp; Young, have not ruled out legal action against Regan, Lanica or its advisers Hambros.
In a statement accompanying the results, Regan again expressed his disappointment that Galileo had been unable to put its proposals to Co-op members.
""We believed very strongly that these were in the best interests of Lanica Trust's shareholders, but equally importantly, to the owners of CWS. However, it was not to be,"" said Regan.
Lanica would continue to examine investment opportunities which over time would ""provide our shareholders with substantial potential for capital growth"", he added. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)

SimonCowell,"Lloyd's of London announced on Tuesday it is to give Names more time to meet planned increases in the capital they must put up to support their underwriting activities.
Lloyd's has also dropped proposals to prevent Names - the traditional backers of the insurance market - using their own homes as collateral for underwriting.
The planned capital increases are part of a package of measures designed to strengthen the financial security that underpins Lloyd's and to provide a level playing field between Names and corporate members.
The longer transition period for the changes announced today may go some way to meeting the concerns of Names' representatives who had called for more time to be given to meet the new capital requirements.
Names fear they are gradually being forced out of the market in favour of corporate capital first introduced in 1994, a charge repeatedly denied by the Lloyd's hierachy.
Names are to be given three years before they have to meet the new requirements of showing evidence of assets amounting to 50 percent of the premiums they underwrite.
In a Lloyd's working party report last month a two-year transition period was proposed but, after consultations, that has been extended from 1999 to the year 2000.
A phased increase in Names' minimum level of means to 350,000 pounds ($571,000) from the current level of 250,000 pounds has also been increased from two to five years and will come into force in 2002.
This 350,000 pounds will be made up of funds held at Lloyd's and evidence of ""other personal wealth"" (OPW).
Proposals to double the OPW requirements for 2000 and beyond have been dropped in favour of a slightly higher level of funds which must be held at Lloyd's.
At present Names must put up between 20 and 30 percent of the total business they back compared with 50 percent for corporate members.
By 2000, Names will have to hold 40 percent of premium capacity at Lloyd's with OPW making up a further 10 percent, bringing them into line with corporate members.
The use of ""principal private residences"" (PPRs) - Names' own homes - as collateral for members' underwriting are to be allowed to continue but only for those in existence at the end of 1994.
No new PPR backed guarantees may be introduced in the future nor existing one increased.
Risk assessment is to be extended to all members from  1998 onward and may require higher capital levels for members with greater risk exposure.
This is expected to affect less than 10 percent of individual members.
The Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM), which represents Names' interests, broadly welcomed today's proposals, saying it was essential that all Names should demonstrate their ability to meet any losses they incurred.
Lloyd's proposals coincided with the publication of an independent report commissioned by the Market Interests Group - an alliance of the ALM, member agents and Lloyd's brokers.
It acknowledged that reform in particular of the annual venture and management of Names' based capital was important, but said that creating an environment that encouraged their disappearance would be a significant mistake.
Earlier on Friday a leading figure in Lloyd's called for the capital structure of the market to be simplified.
Robert Hiscox, chairman of insurance group Hiscox Plc described the annual venture - where syndicates are reformed anew every year - as an ""anachronistic absurdity"" and said the current mixture of unlimited and limited members was too expensive to maintain. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)

SimonCowell,"Lloyd's of London on Friday moved to reassure its traditional backers, Names, that there was no hidden agenda to force them out of the 300 year-old insurance market.
""Trust us,"" outgoing chairman Sir David Rowland answered in response to a question from one worried Name. ""It'll be all right.""
Speaking at his last annual meeting as chairman, Rowland also promised there would be no move to do away with the venture where syndicates are reformed each year, despite criticisms from some managing agents that it is out-of date and expensive.
But he threw his support behind recent changes in the market which have seen members move away from unlimited to limited liability.
On retirement, said Rowland, he would become a limited liability member of Lloyd's.
""Unlimited personal liability has been shown to mean exactly what it says, and I no longer believe that the substantial advantages of that method of trading should blind us to the reality of its possible consequences for the individual,"" he said.
New trading structures with continuous capital, allowing the commitment of resources for the long term development of underwriting businesses, may prove the better route, said Rowland.
Unless it embraced change Lloyd's would see a steady decline in its fortunes, he warned.
The annual venture and the reinsurance of outstanding claims when the syndicate year closed - known as reinsurance to close - had appeared to work admirably until the eight billion pounds ($13 billion) of losses between 1988 and 1992 that at one point threatened to destroy Lloyd's.
Rowland argued it would never again be possible to reinsure to close an annual account without remembering the vulnerabilty of the system.
Critics have increasingly questioned the viability of the annual system of raising capital for Lloyd's, which they say is both costly and prevents long term planning.
Only a few days ago, the outspoken former chairman of Lloyd's, Robert Hiscox, described it as an ""anachronistic absurdity"" and attacked the complexity of the current capital structure where Names and corporate capital co-exist.
There is increasing tension at Lloyd's between Names, whose assets largely back the market on an unlimited basis and limited liability corporate capital, first introduced in 1994.
These tensions would be resolved by market forces promised Rowland.
""The Council affirms members' rights to continue to trade on an annual venture basis if they and their agents wish,"" said Rowland.
""But the Council does not believe that it should prescribe one structure over another. The pattern that results will reflect the choices made by agents, members and new capital providers,"" he said.
Members would also be free to choose whether to continue to trade on an unlimited basis, he said.
The Council, however, expects the trend toward corporate membership to continue.
A survey by the Association of Lloyd's Members, a group which represents Names' interests, showed more than half will be considering conversion to limited status over the next few years, according to Rowland.
Both Rowland and chief executive Ron Sandler in their speeches repeatedly stressed the importance of looking forward to the 500 or so Lloyd's members who turned up to the meeting in London's Barbican Centre. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

SimonCowell,"British composite insurer Commercial Union Plc on Tuesday announced a major restructuring of its domestic general insurance operations to improve profitability and customer service.
The shake-up is aimed at producing some 100 million pounds ($163.5 million) of savings annually by 1999, largely through the reduction of administration and claims supply chain costs.
But the company was quick to emphasise that no jobs were under threat.
""Provided we meet our overall strategic objectives there won't be any compulsory redundancies. There is no hidden agenda here to lose jobs,"" said Andy Homer, manager of Commercial Union's UK general insurance division.
Dubbed 'Market Orientation', the changes will see head office functions reorganised into customer-focused trading units built around specific market segments and distribution channels, the company said.
There will be nine new trading units, each focused on one market sector. They will handle product development, underwriting, marketing and delivery.
Underwriters, marketers, finance and information technology staff will all work in teams, with the task of focusing on customer needs and Commercial Union believes it is the first British insurer to take this cross-functional approach.
""Market Orientation will create an innovative, team-based commercial culture and ensure that we establish ourselves as the pre-eminent force in the UK insurance market,"" said Cees Schrauwers, managing director of Commercial Union non-life insurance.
The company hopes to save 40 million pounds through more effective management of the claims supply chain, which accounts for five percent of the 800 million pound annual claims bill.
It already has a sole supplier agreement for windshields with Autoglass.
The benefits will be shared by customers as well as shareholders, Schrauwers said.
Around 40 million pounds of savings are targeted from administration costs through greater use of new technology.
Four of the group's 22 branches -- Liverpool, Manchester Bristol and Southampton -- have already piloted the changes.
Another 20 million pounds are to come from new modelling software to improve pricing and margins.
Many of the costs involved in the programme have already been incurred as normal business expenses, Homer said.
""In 1998 and 1999 we believe we can complete the programme. There's no hidden charge coming up later in the year,"" he said.

SimonCowell,"British mutual insurer Norwich Union said on Thursday strong demand had led it to increase the members' offer in next week's flotation to 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion).
That means some 400 million pounds worth of shares will be clawed back from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy members' appetite for extra shares which saw many queuing to beat the June 10 deadline.
Some 800 million pounds worth of shares had originally been set aside to meet members' applications but this proved insufficient as members' rushed to top up their holdings at a 25 pence per share discount to the public offer price.
For Norwich, the flotation will bring to an end more than 200 years as a mutual with policyholders owning the company.
Demutualisation will allow it to separate the group's life operations and thus policyholders' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.
It will also strengthen Norwich's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom.
The flotation is likely to value Norwich, which has more than seven million customers, at around 5.5 billion pounds and create Britain's third-largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance.
Nearly three million Norwich policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares in addition to the extra discounted shares.
Norwich still expects the offer price to range between 240 pence and 290 pence per share suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares.
Bookmakers City Index are taking bets on a first day closing price of between 335 pence and 345 pence, an immediate profit of at least 70 pence per share.
It would put the value of the minimum 300 free shares with profits members will receive at over 1,000 pounds.
Many will receive far more depending on the value and duration of their policies.
Non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares.
Institutional demand is a big factor in the likely sharp gains over the offer price.
The two building societies who floated recently -- Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister -- saw their share price squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy the shares and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios.
Like Halifax, Norwich is almost certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies.
The public offer, which is made up of the institutional offer, retail offer and employees offer, will be between 1.1 and 1.2 billion pounds following the clawback of the extra shares for members.
News of the final public and members' offer price and provisional basis of allocation is expected to be made on June 15. Dealings in Norwich shares will begin on June 16. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)

SimonCowell,"British insurer Norwich Union looks set to make a sparkling debut when its shares start trading on the stock market on Monday.
On flotation the company, which has more than seven million customers, is likely to be valued at around six billion pounds making it Britain's third-largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance.
As with recent demutualising building societies Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister, Norwich Union's members have seen the value of their stakes in the company steadily climb since proposals to float the group were first announced.
Nearly three million Norwich policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares under the flotation plans. The company aims to raise another 1.75 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) of capital in a public and members' offer of new shares.
Members have rushed to grab the opportunity to buy further shares at a 25 pence discount, queuing to beat the registration deadline earlier this week.
Norwich Union said on Thursday it still expects the public offer to be priced at between 240 pence and 290 pence per share, 215 pence to 265 pence for members, suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares.
Bookmakers City Index are taking bets on a first day closing price of between 343 pence and 353 pence, a profit for members of at least 78 pence per share.
Many are expected to cash in their profits immediately especially those who have borrowed to fund the purchase of extra shares.
The minimum 300 free shares that 1.8 million with-profits members will receive is likely to be worth more than 1,000 pounds. The average handout will be far higher with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policies.
The 1.1 million non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares.
Members may be disappointed by the number of discounted shares they actually receive with a scaling down of applications a near certainty.
In fact, such has been members' appetite for extra shares that Norwich Union on Thursday announced it was clawing back 400 million pounds worth of shares from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy demand.
That took the members' share to around half of the total offering of 2.4 billion pounds.
For Norwich Union, the flotation will bring to an end more than 200 years as a mutual where ownership is held jointly by members.
Demutualisation will allow it to separate the group's life operations and thus policyholders' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.
It will also strengthen Norwich Union's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom.

Many analysts estimate fair value of the shares at anything from 280 pence to 340 pence.
Norwich Union has also been touted as a possible takeover target, with Australian insurer AMP reportedly heading the list of possible predators.
The probable price tag of the group now looks set to price it out reach of many who might have been interested.

SimonCowell,"Norwich Union, the British insurer which starts trading on the stock market this week, said on Sunday that its public offer of shares had been priced at the top end of pre-float forecasts following huge demand for stock.
As widely expected successful applicants will pay 290 pence per share in the public offer while members will pay 265 pence, reflecting their 25 pence discount.
The offer raised around 2.4 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) for Norwich Union and values it at over 5.6 billion pounds.
That makes it Britain's third largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance.
But many applicants will be disappointed with the number of shares they actually receive after a sharp scaling back of allocations because of the heavy demand.
Members applied for nearly four times as many shares as were available while the institutional offer was covered a mammoth 10 times.
Norwich Union chief executive Allan Bridgewater declared himself ""delighted"" at the response from both members and institutional investors.
It was, he said, an endorsement of the strength of the Norwich Union brand and the prospects for the business going forward.
Members applying for up to 1,500 pounds worth of shares will get their full allotment but for instance an application of 10,000 pounds will get just 22 percent of shares asked for.
Less than half of the 766,000 members applying for shares will receive their full allocation.
In fact, such was members' appetite that Norwich Union had to claw back 400 million pounds worth of shares from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy it.
On the start of trading on the stock market on Monday members will hold just over three-quarters of Norwich Union's share capital.
Those lucky enough to get shares may be tempted to cash-in immediately especially those borrowing to fund the purchases.
But Bridewater said the company had seen no evidence that this would be the case.
Many analysts estimate fair value of the shares at anything from 280 pence to 340 pence. Bookmakers City Index predict the shares to race as high as 353 pence by the end of the first day.
Under the floatation plans which brings to an end 200 years as a mutual nearly three million Norwich Union policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares under the flotation plans in addition to any extra shares in the members offer.
The minimum 300 free shares 1.8 million with-profits members will receive is likely to be worth more than 1,000 pounds. The average handout will be far higher with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policies.
The 1.1 million non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares. Bridewater said the company had considered raising the offer price above its pre-float predictions of between 240 pence and 290 pence but had felt on balance that a 290 pence price reflected a ""fair price"" looking forward.
As with recent demutualising building societies Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister institutional demand will be a big factor in the expected sharp rise in the share price.
Both saw their shares squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios.

TanEeLyn,"A second wave of Chinese soldiers arrived in Hong Kong on Monday to prepare garrison facilities before Beijing takes back the territory from Britain on July 1.
Sixty-six uniformed but unarmed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) drove into Hong Kong in a fleet of 14 staff vehicles from the Chinese border city of Shenzhen.
Monday's group was the second PLA contingent in as many months to arrive in the territory under arrangements worked out by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group overseeing details of Hong Kong's sovereignty change.
Forty soldiers entered on April 21 to prepare logistics and facilities before the eventual arrival on July 1 of the rest of the Chinese troops to be stationed in the territory.
Major-General Liu Zhenwu, commander of the future garrison in Hong Kong, officiated a solemn send-off ceremony on the Chinese side of the border, according to the official Chinese Xinhua news agency.
Liu urged the advance party ""to carry on the fine traditions of the PLA, and to perform the sacred duties entrusted to them by the country and people"".
A handful of British soldiers and Chinese officers from the first advance group greeted the latest contingent on the Hong Kong side in a brief and low-key ceremony.
Sporting dark blue berets and crisply-starched uniforms, the 66 PLA troops crossed over at 1.00 p.m. (0500 GMT) in a convoy comprising a large air-conditioned bus, green army trucks, jeeps and black Audi cars.
Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China on July 1 and the British garrison is already packing up ahead of its departure at midnight June 30.
From July 1, the bustling capitalist city of 6.4 million will be guarded by the PLA.
After the brief greetings, the British soldiers then climbed aboard the Chinese vehicles to help give directions to the Sek Kong military camp in the New Territories.
Besides Sek Kong, the latest group will be stationed in the Prince of Wales Barracks, Stonecutters Island and Gun Club Hill Barracks, a Hong Kong government spokesman said.
A third and final advance guard of 90 soliders is scheduled to arrive on May 30, bringing the total preparatory force of Chinese troops in Hong Kong to 196 before the handover.
Many Hong Kong people are concerned about the presence of PLA troops in the territory because of the bloody military crackdown on activists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
China plans to station some 10,000 troops in the territory after the handover, about the same number as the British garrison at its peak.
But the Chinese officers have been careful to make sure that the troops who have already arrived are keeping a low profile.

TanEeLyn,"Hong Kong's government and business community on Tuesday welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's trade privileges and said they hoped the U.S. Congress would not strike down the move.
The extension of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status was particularly important to Hong Kong, now preparing for its return to Chinese rule on July 1, they said.
""The chamber is very happy,"" Erica Ng, assistant manager of international affairs at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said. ""Every year, we carry out lobbying activities to persuade the U.S. government to renew China's MFN.""
""We welcome the decision. However we would say at this stage it is still to receive the endorsement by Congress. There is a long way to go,"" Christopher Hammerbeck, executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told Reuters.
The Hong Kong government also welcomed Clinton's move and said it would continue to lobby and remind the U.S. congress of the importance of China's trade privileges to Hong Kong.
""We are grateful to know that the President has taken Hong Kong's interests into account"", Secretary for Trade and Industry Denise Yue said in a statement.
""We will continue with our lobbying efforts and keep Congress informed of Hong Kong's position, so as to enable Congress to take our interests into account when it deliberates on the matter,"" Yue said.
Clinton on Monday announced his decision to renew China's MFN status for another year, but the move is expected to face fierce opposition from Congress.
Social conservatives, organised labour and other opponents are preparing for a fight, pointing to China's policies on human and religious rights, trade and other issues.
Many in Congress were wary of China's plans to curb some freedoms in Hong Kong after the handover, Frank Martin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong, told government radio.
Martin was in Washington last week as part of an AmCham delegation lobbying for a renewal of China's MFN status.
""Others mentioned the allegations of China's involvement in election campaign fundraising (in the United States). The trade deficit is a perennial problem -- it is neither economically nor politically sustainable,"" he said.
Hong Kong's business community said U.S. Congress members should bear in mind the importance of China's trade status to Hong Kong.
""Hong Kong could lose very much in re-export trade,"" Ng said. ""We hope that Congress can understand that it is a critical year for Hong Kong because of the handover.
The chambers of commerce say Hong Kong could lose up to US$30 billion annually in trade and related industry revenues. Gross domestic product growth could be cut by about three percentage points and some 86,000 jobs in Hong Kong could be lost if China loses its trading privileges.
""We recognise fully not only the vital importance of China but the collateral impact it has on the prosperity of Hong Kong,"" Hammerbeck of the British business chamber said.
""The membership of this chamber employs not only 300,000 Hong Kong people but we also employ large numbers of Chinese citizens in China.""

TanEeLyn,"China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping did not live to see Hong Kong's return to Beijing rule, but his eldest son Deng Pufang said on Wednesday he was thinking about seeing the July 1 handover.
Deng, 53, said his father, who engineered Hong Kong's return to China under a ""one country two systems"" policy, would have deeply regretted not having lived to see the change of flag.
The late Deng would also have liked to ""take a walk on Hong Kong soil"", his son told reporters during a visit to Hong Kong to promote a medical action plan in China.
""I haven't decided whether or not to come"" Deng said.
He said he did not think his family members had yet asked Beijing for permission to see the handover.
Deng was in Hong Kong for the launch of a plan to prevent and treat blindness and other eye diseases in the country.
His father died on February 19, aged 92, after almost two decades in power in which he opened China to the world and moved it down the path of reform and the free market.
Deng Pufang, a paraplegic, was hurt in a fall from a window when his father was being persecuted during the 1966-1976 radical leftist Cultural Revolution.
He was candid as he fielded personal questions from reporters, and emotional as he spoke of his father's death.
""He lived to 1997, but he died before the handover. This, I believe is his deep regret. It is a great pity,"" he said.
He also said his mother and siblings were very moved by the outpouring of grief in Hong Kong when his father died.
""On behalf of my whole family I want to express our gratitude to Hong Kong people for the condolences they gave when my father passed away. We are thankful for the warmth and the highest regards given to my father.""
In Hong Kong, the senior Deng is best remembered for his firmness in ending what Chinese people view as a century and a half of ""national shame"" under British colonial rule and engineering its return to China.
Britain wrenched Hong Kong from China as war spoils in the 19th century Opium Wars and has ruled it for 156 years.
Britain formally agreed to return Hong Kong to China in the Joint Declaration of 1984, under which Hong Kong was guaranteed a high degree of self-rule for 50 years after the handover.
Deng Pufang said his father was confident while he was alive that Hong Kong would continue to prosper after the handover.
""He was very confident that no matter what happened, China will manage Hong Kong well and that Hong Kong people will rule Hong Kong very effectively,"" he said.
"
TanEeLyn,"For many in China, a fabled El Dorado lies at the southern tip of their vast country -- Hong Kong, rich and elusive.
The dream is likely to stay that way after the British-ruled territory reverts to Chinese rule on June 30.
Yang He, a Hong Kong resident for the past 40 years, has waited more than 11 years for his son to get a permit to come from China to join him, his wife and two daughters.
""We applied in 1986 for my son to come to Hong Kong. He has been cared for by his grandparents since he was a baby.
""We had to leave him when he was only 25 days old because he had no permit,"" Yang, 56, told Reuters in a recent interview.
""Most nights I cannot sleep for just thinking of him.""
Yang is not alone in his suffering.
Hong Kong authorities say there are 34,000 children in China waiting to join either one or both parents in Hong Kong, but Chinese authorities say the figure could be higher than 100,000.
CHINESE HEAR OF CITY STREETS PAVED WITH GOLD
In China, rock stars sing patriotic songs welcoming the return of Hong Kong, and television stations beam into Chinese homes documentaries describing the wealthy metropolis, giving an impression of streets lined with opportunities -- and gold.
But most of China's 1.2 billion people will probably never set foot on Hong Kong soil.
Although the British will leave and the Chinese red flag will flutter over the territory, Hong Kong will be separately run under a ""one country, two systems"" formula espoused by China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
To stop a flood of mainlanders into the tiny but crowded territory of 6.4 million people, border security is tight -- on both sides of the line.
Hong Kong operates a quota system permitting 150 mainlanders to migrate to Hong Kong each day, 66 of them children.
But it can take years to obtain the precious ""one-way permit"" -- and many resort to backdoor methods in dispair.
QUOTAS OPEN TO CORRUPTION
China-born Yang said he has totally lost faith in China's bureaucracy and communist system, which he said was so riddled with corruption that only the rich can buy their way out.
""In 1995, when I asked again about the status of my son's application, they (government officials) asked for money. They said they wanted at least HK$130,000 (US$16,800),"" Yang said.
""They told me it wasn't them who would take all the money, they have to ask favours from other people, buy cigarettes, drinks, fruit, and there wasn't such a thing as digging from their own pockets to pay my son's passage to Hong Kong.""
Yang paid HK$40,000 (US$5,175) and a few gold rings when he applied in 1985 to get his wife and eldest daughter to join him.
They arrived in 1986. But there was no permit for his baby.
""If you have money, you can come, proudly by train, if not, you can't come. If you haven't enough, you come illegally, dangerously by speedboat in the night,"" he said.
""You don't know the Chinese system, it is so corrupt, it would be best if after the handover, the Hong Kong government takes over the responsibility of approving the applications,"" said So Ying, a mother who has waited five years for her son and daughter to join her and her husband in Hong Kong.
Some get so frustrated by the wait that they have taken the matter into their own hands, paying between HK$2,000 to HK$4,000 to smugglers -- or ""snakeheads"" as they are known locally -- to spirit their spouses and children into Hong Kong.
Between January and April 1997, 1,449 young illegal migrants surrendered to authorities against 540 for the whole of 1996.
In the first four months of 1997, 7,406 illegal migrants, including adults, were arrested around border areas, against 23,180 for the whole of 1996.
HONG KONG AUTHORITIES GET TOUGH
In an unusual show of force, Hong Kong immigration officials last month seized eight-year-old Chung Yeuk-lam and her mother from their flat and sent them back to China.
The girl had been carried illegally into Hong Kong by her mother when she was just three months old.
Colonial Governor Chris Patten said it was important not to make exceptions in order to quash rumours spread by snakeheads that there will be an amnesty for illegals after the handover, which the Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied.
Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have joined forces to block the tide of mainland Chinese illegal immigrants.
The South China Morning Post has said one way to help solve the problem would be to quash the El Dorado myth in China.
""The simplest way to shrink their numbers would be if China dispelled the idea that Hong Kong's streets are paved with gold,"" the newspaper said.
"
TanEeLyn,"Chinese political dissidents living in exile in Hong Kong are making a final dash for Western sanctuary as the clock ticks closer to the British colony's July 1 handover to communist-ruled China.
Fearful over China's future political clout in Hong Kong, scores have fled the territory and a dozen or so other dissidents are pleading with the government to help them out, pro-democracy activists said on Wednesday.
""There are very few now in Hong Kong, just over 10 people,"" said legislator Lau Chin-shek, spokesman for a pro-democracy group, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China.
""It's depends on whether they think it will be problematic if they remain in Hong Kong. From what the (Chinese) Communist Party has done in the past, it's worrying to these people.""
The Alliance, which China has branded as subversive, has helped scores of Chinese dissidents in exile in Hong Kong find sanctuary in third countries before the British-run territory reverts to China just 27 days from now.
""Many left this year. Nineteen left last week,"" Lau said.
Many fled to Hong Kong in the aftermath of the bloody military crackdown on student activists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989. But Lau said he was confident those remaining would be able to leave before July 1.
""We are very confident those eligible for political refugee status will be able to leave. Even the Hong Kong government wants them to leave...it is helping them,"" Lau said.
Anxieties over the future of Chinese dissidents in Hong Kong mounted as the territory's activists prepared to mourn hundreds, possibly thousands, of victims in China's anti-democracy crackdown, eight years ago to the day.
Up to 40,000 people were expected to attend a candlelit vigil in Hong Kong where organisers will demand a reversal of China's ""counter-revolutionary"" label on the crushed 1989 movement and the release of political prisoners in the country.
One mainlander, Zhang Taisong, had threatened to set himself on fire at the rally to force the Hong Kong government to quicken the exit of remaining dissidents, the Chinese-language newspaper Apple Daily said on Wednesday.
Worries were aggravated this week after Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa said Chinese dissidents who entered the territory illegally cannot stay after the handover.
Tung, who was selected in December to become Hong Kong's first leader under Beijing's auspices, said only those who entered legally and with unlimited stay could continue to live in the territory.
Democratic Party legislator Cheung Man-kwong, also a member of the Alliance, warned that the dissidents could be in danger if they were forced to return to China after the handover.
""If they are forced to leave Hong Kong, it's very dangerous because they are political dissidents. If they go back to China, China will put them in jail,"" Cheung said.
Prominent Chinese dissident Chai Ling, a leader of the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement, voiced concern over the future of post-handover freedoms when she visited Hong Kong last month.
Chai, now studying at Harvard University in the United States, also urged Hong Kong people to defend their freedoms. Visits like hers might become a thing of the past after July 1.
Tung has announced plans to trim back civil liberties, ban overseas funding for political groups and require police permits for activists to stage protests.

TanEeLyn,"A four-year saga over Hong Kong's Container Terminal Number Nine (CT9) project was finally resolved on Thursday with a berth swapping plan and removal a key consortium, government officials said at a news conference.
Under the terms of the deal, which received Beijing's blessing on Thursday, British-controlled Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd no longer leads the consortium, which has been renamed Asia Container Terminals Ltd (ACT).
ACT, formerly the Tsingyi Consortium, would swap the two berths in CT9 originally awarded for two existing berths in the existing Container Terminal Eight (CT8) currently operated by Modern Terminals Ltd (MTL), a unit of Wharf (Holdings) Ltd
The Sea-Land Group would take over from Jardine as leader of the consortium, said an ACT spokesman also present at the news conference.
MTL would build three of the four berths at CT9, while Hong Kong International Terminals Ltd (HIT), a a unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, would build one berth.
Both HIT and MTL would also have one smaller feeder berth each at CT9, officials said.
The contract to develop CT9, which will have an annual capacity of 2.2 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) upon completion, was awarded by the Hong Kong government in 1992 to the consortium by private treaty grant.
Tsingyi was originally allocated two berths. Existing container terminal operators, HIT and MTL, were awarded development rights to one berth each.
Beijing, citing the lack of an open tender, had refused to approve the project as required because it straddles Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China.
Beijing had accused the Hong Kong government of rewarding Jardine, a pillar of the British establishment since the colony was founded, for supporting Governor Chris Patten's electoral reforms, themselves the object of bitter Chinese opposition.
Government officials and the terminal operators declined to comment on the political aspects of the case.
""This is purely a commercial decision, it is not political ...no one can force any agreement upon the commercial partners,"" said Stephen Ip, the Hong Kong government's Secretary for Economic Services.
ACT representatives said the consortium had not discussed the changes with China.
""We had no discussion with the PRC (People's Republic of China) and we've had no political pressure from the PRC,"" ACT spokesman Ed Aldridge said.
ACT is 29.5 percent owned by Sea-Land. Jardine group companies, Jardine Pacific and the Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd jointly hold 28.5 percent.
Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd holds 28.5 percent and New World Infrastructure Ltd 13.5 percent.
Officials declined to disclose cost estimates for the project, adding that all other details had yet to be worked out. -- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 28436441

TanEeLyn,"Sing Tao Holdings Ltd, facing a probe by graft-busters at its Hongkong Standard Newspapers Ltd unit, could see a drop in advertising revenues at its English-language papers, media analysts said on Thursday.
""Advertising will be affected, of course. People look at the circulation when they decide to place ads,"" said Ben Kwong, research director at Dharmala Securities.
Hongkong Standard Newspapers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sing Tao, publishes the English-language Hongkong Standard and Sunday Standard newspapers.
""Advertisers will probably withhold or be hesitant until they have clarification from the company as to what exactly their circulation was,"" another analyst said.
Hong Kong's graft watchdog, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), said it raided the Hongkong Standard offices on Wednesday as part of an investigation into fraudulent inflation of circulation figures.
The ICAC also arrested four current employees and two former staff members.
The ICAC said its investigations had ""revealed a scheme which involved the deliberate excess printing of over 10,000 extra copies of the newspapers each day which were purportedly sold to a bogus bulk distributor"".
The surplus was actually sold as waste paper, it said in a statement on Wednesday.
""ICAC inquiries also indicated that more recently the deliberately printed surplus and systematic disposal has ranged from 14,000 up to 23,000 copies per day,"" it said.
A Sing Tao official told Reuters the company would not make any comment while the investigations were continuing.
Trading in Sing Tao shares resumed on Thursday after a one-day suspension. The shares closed HK$0.075 lower at HK$2.90.
Analysts said that while Sing Tao shares would come under some pressure due to the probe at its Hongkong Standard Newspapers unit, the publishing group was not expected to suffer deep cuts to its bottom line as the English-language papers had not brought in much profit in past years.
On Thursday, Sing Tao published an announcement reprinting the ICAC statement and gave results for the group.
""The results of Hongkong Standard for the year ended 31 March, 1996, showed an operating loss in excess of the operating loss of approximately HK$11.7 million (US$1.51 million) incurred by the group in newspaper publishing in that year,"" the announcement said.
It gave no breakdown of the losses.
""The impact on Sing Tao shares won't be great. Investors anyway don't weight newspaper stocks highly because of their difficult market conditions and keen competition,"" said Kwong.
Some analysts said Hong Kong's other English-language daily, the South China Morning Post -- published by South China Morning Post (Holdings) Ltd -- would emerge the clear winner.
""If anybody had wanted to save a little bit before by going on a cheaper advertising rate in the Standard, they will now say 'Why take the risk?'"" one analyst said.
The ICAC probe is not the first time the Sing Tao group has made news in Hong Kong.
In May, rumours swept the stock market that chairman Sally Aw was in talks to sell all or part of her 68 percent holding in the group to a Malaysian party. Aw denied the rumours.
The group shut its Chinese-language Sing Tao Evening Post newspaper in December, citing sluggish circulation and advertising revenue.

TanEeLyn,"Investors swept up in the current wave of ""red chip"" fever for China-related stocks are at risk of losses because of the poor health of many mainland state-owned companies, a senior economist warned on Friday.
Demand for the Hong Kong-listed companies with mainland ties has accompanied record highs in the Hang Seng index, in a burst of optimism about Hong Kong's handover to China in three weeks.
But Kenneth Courtis, strategist and chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group Asia Pacific, warned that the speculative gains could be short-lived in light of serious problems with mainland Chinese companies.
A growing number of Chinese and China-backed companies have listed in Hong Kong, and the lure of China's huge domestic market and economic potential have proved difficult for foreign investors to resist.
In Hong Kong, punters -- from serious investors to the unsophisticated -- have formed long queues to get their hands on subscription forms to buy new shares, sometimes paying for them, in the hope of making fortunes.
""People who are rushing into the streets to try to pay their $100 to get a subscription form may think they'll be able to sell that some time soon,"" said Courtis.
""Things like that usually end in tears and it won't be any different this time,"" he told the Foreign Correspondents Club.
But Courtis said caution would be a better bet as many mainland state-owned companies were losing money and Beijing itself was in a race against time to restructure them.
Chinese state-owned enterprises, which have lived under the shelter of communist rule, remain deeply inefficient and Beijing is encouraging many of them to merge into huge conglomerates in the hope that the stronger firms may help ailing ones.
""We are now in a situation when losses (made) by state companies are so big that they've come to destabilise the financial system,"" Courtis said.
He said that the problems of these companies are a factor in China's difficult campaign to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which promotes free trade and reliance on market forces.
""One of the reasons it is so difficult to negotiate WTO membership for China is that (most) state companies wouldn't survive under WTO rules.""
Courtis said he did not think China would enter the WTO for four to five years but was confident the United States will continue Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status for China for another year.
""It will go through this year. The President might have to use his veto to overscome the resistance...but the debate will be bitter,"" he told reporters after his speech to the club.
President Bill Clinton announced in May his decision to renew China's MFN status but many members of Congress have said they will vote against it, angered by China's policies on trade, human and religious rights.
"
TanEeLyn,"Future legislators on Saturday defied an imminent legal challenge and passed a string of laws for Hong Kong which will come into effect after the territory reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.
The 60-member provisional legislature met in Shenzhen, just across the border in China, where it was presented with a series of bills by officials of the future administration led by Hong Kong's chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa.
A crucial bill governing residency rights in Hong Kong after Britain hands it back to China on July 1 passed through two readings, Hong Kong's Wharf Cable TV station reported.
Three bills governing the membership of municipal bodies after the handover passed through all three readings, it said.
Under rules laid down earlier by the future chamber, proposed bills must go through three readings before July 1.
They will then be ratified as post-handover Hong Kong laws on July 1.
The provisional legislature was formed under Beijing's auspices in December and is poised to replace the current elected chamber, which China will disband, on July 1.
Its meeting in Shenzhen, however, follows a warning by the Democratic Party that it would file a lawsuit against the shadow chamber within the next few days claiming it was illegal to have two legislatures operating at the same time.
The imminent lawsuit has been facilitated by an earlier ruling by Hong Kong's Supreme Court allowing the Democrats to use government funds to fight laws passed by the shadow chamber.
But in Shenzhen, members of the provisional legislature scoffed at the imminent legal battle and claimed the future lawmaking chamber had strong legal basis.
""I'm only sad that Hong Kong must spend so much money over something when the outcome, everyone knows, is a foregone conclusion,"" said provisional legislator Tam Yiu-chung.
The president of the shadow body, Rita Fan, also waved it off.
""It (the threatened lawsuit) won't affect the work of the provisional legislature...It doesn't bother me at all. I'm confident we will prevail in the end,"" Fan told reporters.
The provisional chamber holds meetings, however, in Shenzhen, instead of Hong Kong, to fend off potential legal attacks.
The bill on residency rights, which was unveiled by future leader Tung on Friday, will tighten rules on immigrants getting permanent residency after July 1, local television stations reported.
It proposes that illegal immigrants, after residing in the territory for seven years, need permission from the immigration chief to receive permanent right of abode.
Under the current system, they are automatically granted permanent residency after seven years.
Critics on Saturday lambasted the bill as a way of keeping out Chinese dissidents, but a senior Tung aide dismissed the charge.
""Everyone, if they enter Hong Kong illegally, cannot get permanent residency in Hong Kong. This does not mean we are targeting any group of people,"" Elsie Leung, the future Justice Secretary told reporters.
Provisional legislator Henry Tang agreed.
""We will be part of China, in the event that there is any advocacy of splitting with the motherland, or other such activities, we must have laws (against them),"" Tang said.
"
TanEeLyn,"Future Hong Kong lawmakers, poised for a bitter legal clash with the pro-democracy camp, passed a string of laws on Saturday to come into effect after the territory reverts to China on July 1.
Meeting just across the border in China's Shenzhen city, the 60-member provisional legislature was presented with a series of bills by officials of the future administration led by Hong Kong's chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa.
The most crucial was a bill to govern residency rights in Hong Kong after Britain hands its colony of over 150 years back to China at midnight on June 30.
The bill, which passed through two readings on Saturday, is expected to pass a third before June 30 and be ""rectified"", or officially made into law on July 1.
The meeting came as Hong Kong's Democratic Party warned it will slap a lawsuit within the next few days on the China-backed provisional chamber, which Beijing has vowed to put in place of the current elected legislative council on July 1.
The party, which has 19 seats in the current chamber, claims the provisional legislature is unconstitutional and that it is illegal for two legislatures to operate at the same time.
Hong Kong's Supreme Court facilitated the imminent legal battle when it allowed the Democrats on Thursday to use government funds to fight laws passed by the shadow chamber.
But the looming legal clash threatens to involve more than just Hong Kong's incoming and outgoing lawmaking chambers.
A Beijing mouthpiece accused the British-led administration in Hong Kong of supporting the democrats -- against China.
""The British have once again threatened the smooth transition of sovereignty by allowing legal aid to challenge the laws passed by the provisional legislature,"" the Beijing-funded Wen Wei Po said in an editorial on Saturday.
Members of the provisional legislature who, like future leader Tung, were carefully selected into office under Beijing's auspices in December, scoffed at the looming lawsuit and claimed the future lawmaking chamber had strong legal basis.
""I'm only sad that Hong Kong must spend so much money over something when the outcome, everyone knows, is a foregone conclusion,"" said provisional legislator Tam Yiu-chung.
But there was an upbeat note as Hong Kong moves ever closer to the Chinese fold.
A survey conducted by Hong Kong's Home Affairs Branch found 78 percent of Hong Kong people were satisfied with the current situation in the territory, up from 76 percent in a March poll. The survey, done in mid-May, polled a total of 1,503 people.
But confidence levels dipped slightly. Some 72 percent said they expected Hong Kong to remain prosperous and stable, down from 73 percent in March. Twenty percent expected the situation to improve in the next 12 months, down from 24 percent in March.
On the economic front, China made further inroads into Hong Kong's strategic infrastructure industry with the purchase of a stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.
In an announcement late on Friday, Cable &amp; Wireless Plc, parent of HongKong Telecoms, said it sold a 5.5 percent stake to state-owned China Telecom for US$1.185 billion.
"
TanEeLyn,"Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa assured the Democratic Party on Tuesday that it will not be cast out into the cold when China resumes control over the territory at midnight June 30.
But Tung rejected the Democrats' request to leave Hong Kong's election system alone, party chairman Martin Lee said.
Speaking to reporters after a one-hour meeting with Tung, Lee said his party wanted spokesmen on various issues to have ""direct contact"" with the future government.
""Mr Tung is supportive of the idea and we are very happy,"" he said.
The Democrats accuse Tung of seeking to alter Hong Kong's first-past-the-post voting methods specifically to dilute their presence in Hong Kong's legislature.
Tung and his advisers are considering replacing the British-style system with a form of proportional representation or multi-seat single vote system and have sought the views of the public.
""This seems to be a case of starting with the desired result,"" Lee said.
""Reducing the number of democrats and working backwards to an electoral system which will produce this result.""
Hong Kong has been a British colony for more than 150 years. A China-selected lawmaking chamber is poised to replace the current elected body which Beijing will disband at the handover.
The Democratic Party, the largest party with 19 seats in the current legislature, boycotted the incoming provisional chamber, and its members will be cast into the political wilderness for about a year.
They plan to contest the first post-handover elections scheduled in mid-1998 under new electoral laws to be passed by the interim-appointed chamber.
Tung denies scrapping the first-past-the-post system is designed to dilute the influence of the democrats.
Lee said Tung had rejected the Democratic Party's proposal for a taskforce to amend Hong Kong's future constitition, the China-promulgated Basic Law, to speed the path to full democracy in Hong Kong.
""We raised with Mr Tung the setting up of a taskforce to review the Basic Law provisions on democracy. We told Mr Tung that the pace for democratisation as contained in the Basic Law is much, much too slow,"" Lee said.
""Even by the year 2003, still half of the legislature will not be democratically elected by the people of Hong Kong.
""But Mr Tung gave us a flat no... We are extremely unhappy about that,"" Lee said.
The Basic Law provides for creeping democratisation leading to a fully elected legislature after 10 years.
At present, only 20 of the 60 seats are directly elected. Ten are returned by an electoral college made up of local civic authority chiefs and the rest are allocated to business and professional bodies in what are known as ""functional constituencies"".

TanEeLyn,"Hong Kong yachtsmen bent with the wind on Thursday, voting overwhelmingly to adopt a Chinese name, two weeks before the territory's return to Chinese rule on July 1.
While keeping the name ""Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club"" in English, members of the elite colonial sporting club voted in a show of hands to adopt a Chinese name, which when translated would simply mean ""Hong Kong Yacht Club"".
At an extraordinary general meeting called to decide on the Chinese name, club commodore David Kong admitted to more than 200 members that the Chinese name was a compromise.
The club, which to this day has fewer ethnic Chinese members than Westerners, was deeply divided last year when its mostly British members fought hard to keep the ""Royal"" tag on the English name.
Chinese members lobbied hard but failed twice to remove the ""Royal"" tag, a symbol of British colonialism that they felt would be inappropriate after Hong Kong reverts to China.
""The proposal we have in front of us is a compromise. We are being courteous and considerate to the incoming government and courteous and considerate to our members,"" Kong told members.
Still, about seven members at the meeting voted nay.
""What is this? One club, two names?"" one member joked aloud, drawing uproarious laughter and applause from the rest.
Hong Kong, a British colony for 156 years, will revert to China from July 1 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, espoused by China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
""I don't see why we should be inconsistent. If we are ""Royal"" in English, we should be ""huang jia"" in Chinese,"" a Caucasian member said at the meeting. ""Huang jia"" is ""Royal"" in Mandarin, China's official language.
Choi Chung-yung, a member since 1984, said it was important not to have ""huang jia"" in the Chinese name.
""If we are known as ""Royal"" after the handover, we may be disadvantaged if ever we need help from Chinese authorities because we will be seen as British,"" Choi said.
""Anyway, since the day I joined, I've never seen the ""Royal"" as meaningful or prestigious, unlike the British,"" he said.
Long before July 1, other elite clubs in Hong Kong have dropped their ""Royal"" tags and are now known simply as the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Hong Kong Golf Club.
The queen's portrait has also been knocked off stamps and coins in favour of the territory's harbour skyline.
"
TanEeLyn,"In a move certain to anger Beijing, publisher Penguin group and Chinese activists on Friday launched a compilation of letters and essays written in prison by prominent Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.
China's Foreign Ministry has already denounced publication of the book ""The Courage To Stand Alone"", which contains excerpts of hundreds of letters Wei wrote to his siblings, prison authorities and top members of China's Communist Party.
The eloquent and fearless letters were written during his 14-year (1979 to 1993) imprisonment, most of the time while in solitary confinement in a tiny cell.
Wei, 47, is China's best known dissident and regarded as the father of China's democracy movement.
He was jailed in 1979 for counter-revolutionary incitement after advocating democratic change when he referred to democracy as China's much needed ""fifth modernisation"".
Wei managed to obtain his letters, many of which were never mailed but kept in his prison dossier, just before he was released from jail in September 1993.
After six months of freedom, Wei was detained again in 1994 and later sentenced to a further 14 years for treason.
At a news conference on Friday, Chinese pro-democracy activists called for the immediate release of Wei, who has been denied medical attention for his deteriorating health.
""I am asking all of you, the people of Hong Kong and all freedom loving people of the world, to join me in demanding Wei Jingsheng's immediate and unconditional release,"" said Xiao Qiang, executive director of lobby group Human Rights in China.
""Democracy and human rights are not luxuries for Chinese people, they are necessities,"" Xiao said.
Wei, now in a jail in Hebei province, has arthritis, high blood pressure and stomach problems, and his spirit is now flagging, according to members of his family who are allowed to visit him once a month, said Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch/Asia.
""From accounts of his family, he has become very despondent. We have to be worried about his survival this time,"" said Munro.
Also present at the news conference was dissident Liu Qing, and close friend of Wei, who was jailed for 10 years for publishing the transcript of Wei's 1979 trial.
Liu told reporters he was worried about the future of political and human rights in Hong Kong after midnight June 30, when the territory of 6.4 million people reverts to Chinese rule after 156 years as a British colony.
Under Sino-British treaties on Hong Kong's handover, the territory is promised a high degree of self rule under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that was espoused by the late Deng.
""For the long term, I cannot believe in China's dictatorship. In the last few decades, this government has never kept to its words. It has always gone back on its words, its policy on Tibet and many other policies,"" Liu said.
""I cannot say that Hong Kong will be an exception to this record,"" said Liu, the chairman of Human Rights in China.
"
TanEeLyn,"Britain and China signalled on Monday that they are set to discuss Beijing's late request to deploy more troops in Hong Kong before the territory reverts to Chinese rule at midnight this June 30.
Top British and Chinese officials on the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a body handling details of Hong Kong's transfer, also said they were confident the matter would soon be resolved.
Beijing's request to have more of its People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops positioned in Hong Kong before the handover emerged last week and was quickly surrounded in controversy.
British officials were adamant there was no question of London agreeing to China's request as the British garrison alone remains responsible till the handover, barely two weeks away.
But on Monday, a top British representative on the JLG said both sides would soon discuss the issue.
""The subject has been on our agenda to discuss and we're continuing to discuss it,"" Hugh Davies told reporters.
Zhao Jihua, Davies' Chinese counterpart on the JLG, told reporters that Beijing thought it was necessary to have more troops deployed in Hong Kong before the handover.
""There is a practical need. It is a matter that needs to be resolved and we hope to solve it,"" Zhao said.
China has said it needs a few hours before the midnight handover ceremony to deploy its main force.
Beijing has already sent an advance party of 200 soldiers to prepare garrison, supply and communication facilities. Britain insisted they be unarmed and wear uniforms only in barracks.
Many Hong Kong people are jittery about the arrival of the PLA as they remember the comunist army's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
But both Zhao and Davies gave no sign whether Britain would concede to China's latest request.
""We've made our position clear already,"" Davies said, but he added: ""I think the arrival of the PLA will take place as around July 1. We're not going to discuss what we're going to be talking about privately on the subject.""
Beijing's request to send more troops and London's clear refusal last week threatened to deepen a rift over Hong Kong's sovereignty changeover.
London, together with Washington, angered Beijing last week by saying they will boycott the swearing-in of a China-backed legislature during the midnight handover party to replace Hong Kong's current democratically-elected chamber.
Beijing has vowed to disband the existing chamber, removing at a stroke democratic reforms introduced unilaterally by Britain inthe twilight years of its rule in Hong Kong.
"
TanEeLyn,"On a stage full of Hong Kong popstars, a middle-aged woman, cracking jokes, stole the show on Tuesday as Hong Kong's future first lady and a song-writer.
This was a kind of solo debut for Betty Tung who has written the lyrics of a song the world will hear when Hong Kong rejoins China on July 1.
Till now she has been overshadowed by her husband, prospective leader Tung Chee-hwa, an ex-shipping tycoon still wary of the public spotlight.
Accompanied by photographers' popping flashlights and questioning journalists, she walked into a studio and beamed widely, taking it all in her stride.
Tung Chee-hwa and Betty will be Hong Kong's leading couple from midnight June 30 when Britain hands the territory to China and governor Chris Patten and his wife Lavender sail away.
Elegantly dressed in a blue navy suit with a scarf, Betty took to the stage with half a dozen popular music stars to announce a musical gala on July 1, first day of Chinese rule.
Featuring in the ""Hong Kong Medley"" during the gala show is a song, ""The Homecoming"", in which Betty stars as lyricist.
""I don't know who you've come to see, but I've come to see my idols,"" Betty told reporters as she posed next to heartthrobs of the local popular music scene -- Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, George Lam and Sally Yeh -- who will all belt out the medley on July 1.
Little known in the past to the Hong Kong public, Tung and his wife were thrown into media glare when he was selected in December to become the territory's first post-handover leader.
But Betty seems to have taken on her demanding public role with consummate ease, perhaps even more so than her husband.
""Do I not look good to you?"" she shot out to one reporter when asked how well she and her husband were taking to their new public roles, before promptly taking the next question.
Announcers at the packed news conference said Betty provided inspiration for the ""The Homecoming"" and wrote the lyrics.
But the first lady-to-be sought to play down the accolade.
""I do not know musical notes, I just felt the song was so good to my ear and I was very much encouraged to do a bit of thinking,"" she told reporters.
""But I really didn't contribute very much to the song, I really must pass the microphone to my colleagues who did most of the work,"" she said.
Her husband, meanwhile, will be surprised.
""Mr Tung doesn't know I'm here. I think I've told him that there is a song. His staff has heard it.""
""But he's so very busy with the handover, I hope he will be very pleasantly surprised,"" Betty said.
"
TanEeLyn,"Asia's ""party of the century"" arouses few cheers from a minority of active democrats in Hong Kong who fear Chinese rule will bring repression of liberties.
For these activists, campaigning at home and abroad for better guarantees from Beijing, there is little cause for celebration when the clock strikes midnight this June 30.
They plan protests as Britain hands Hong Kong back to China, which brands some supporters as ""subversive,"" and in the future to test the extent of cherished civil liberties.
Leaders of the movement have thrown down a gauntlet to Chinese authorities by vowing to force their way into parliament as the world watches Britain hand the territory back to China.
The pro-democracy campaigners remain sceptical about China's pledged self-rule for Hong Kong for 50 years under a ""one country, two systems"" formula espoused by the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Worries abound, they say, that the future administration under shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, whom China supports, will curb rights and civil liberties in the territory of 6.4 million.
""When international attention dies down, who knows what will happen? What will happen when people become complacent?"" said Law Yuk-kai, director of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.
Controversially, when Hong Kong, a British colony of 156 years, reverts to China, an interim 60-member lawmaking chamber will replace the existing elected legislature, to the dismay of democrats and the West.
With this one step, Beijing will remove at a stroke democratic reforms introduced unilaterally by the British-led administration during its twilight years of rule in Hong Kong.
The interim chamber has also passed laws which from July 1 will ban foreign funding for political groups and require people to apply for police permits before they can stage protests.
Now, the police need only be informed ahead of protests.
Even more sinister, activists say, is Tung's introduction of a broad concept of ""national security"" which empowers the police to reject applications if they are thought to threaten Hong Kong's 'security' or China's territorial integrity.
""I expect the human rights situation to deteriorate, if Hong Kong people don't stand firm and there is no support from political leaders overseas,"" Law said in a recent interview.
""If such concepts like 'national security' are used for political convenience, it's an end to all freedoms. Anything that is thought to challenge the future administration can be struck down by this concept,"" he said.
Chinese officials have also warned against any advocacy of independence for Taiwan or Tibet, and self-censorship has wormed its way into the local press, which until recently was among the world's freest and most vibrant.
""Journalists have told us they are worried and are under great pressure and are practising self-censorship,"" Law said.
Chinese political dissidents in exile have warned of tough days ahead and said they could not conceive of China keeping to its pledge of a high degree of self rule for Hong Kong.
""In the long term, I cannot believe China's dictatorship. In the last few decades, this government has never kept to its words. It has always gone back on its promises, its policies on Tibet, many other policies,"" said Liu Qing, who was jailed for 10 years before leaving for the United States in 1992.
Another warned of possible abuses. ""'National seurity' worries me, there is a real danger. It has already been used against Chinese people as a tool to suppress political dissent. It can be similarly abused in Hong Kong,"" said Xiao Qiang, executive director of the New York-based Human Rights in China lobby group, in a recent interview.
But some inveterate pro-democracy activists are here to stay, despite the odds. Emboldened by the international glare enveloping Hong Kong, hopefully for years to come, they are banking on hopes that Beijing would not dare go too far.
""This is my home and I don't intend to leave at all,"" said Martin Lee, leader of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest party.
""I don't think they are going to do anything nasty to my family. I don't believe they will dare do such things--what will people say if anything happens?"" said the accomplished lawyer, who has no foreign passport or residency rights overseas.
But the fear runs deeper for some. Law, married to a fellow activist, has no children--by choice. ""My wife and I, we can choose the way we want to live, but our children can't,"" Law, an activist for over 10 years, said.
Taxi-driver Shing Wai-pong, a seasoned protestor, has packed off his Malaysian-Chinese wife and daughter to Malaysia. ""I am prepared for the worst. I am not afraid of death or jail. My wife and child left Hong Kong so now I have nothing to worry about,"" he said recently.
"
TanEeLyn,"Its wheels whirring non-stop, Hong Kong is moving into top gear to prepare for one of the high points in its history -- its return to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 after a century and a half as a British colony.
In a land where people are often too busy rushing about their own business and civil servants too occupied to pay heed to the walk-in visitor, the historic changeover is giving the city a sparkling facelift.
Roads and tiny lanes leading to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the midnight handover ceremony will take place, have been cleared of street-sleepers. In theiur place are pretty potted plants and ornamental iron fences.
Elaborate ""1997 handover"" lighting displays depicting dragons, dolphins and orchids illuminate glassy tower blocks.
In just 12 days, Britain will hand Hong Kong back to China.
As the big night nears, over 4,000 VIPs including heads of state, ministers and officials from all over the world will descend upon the territory to witness the historic flag change.
Thanks to almost 8,000 foreign reporters, specially flown in for the occasion, the event will be beamed to every television set and chronicled in every newspaper on the planet.
Tiny, famously industrious, Hong Kong is leaving nothing to chance.
Hotels have given intensive training to bellboys and chambermaids so they can field, as well as any schoolmaster, tough questions from puzzled VIPs or hustling reporters on Hong Kong history, geography, nightlife and typhoon threats.
At front-line government offices, civil servants seconded to the huge celebration machinery beam from ear to ear as they try to cater to the whims of visiting and local newsmen.
""I'm really impressed,"" a local reporter said as she walked into a press liaison office to get her identification dog tag.
On hand were a dozen staff and she was on his way in under 10 minutes with a stylish sling-bag full of giveaways -- courtesy of blue-chip sponsors only too happy to play a part.
At Hong Kong's top-notch hotels, employees have been given security clearance by police and their best suites, reserved for the VIPs, will be swept clean with bomb detectors.
Anyone up to mischief or with no business at the hotel stands little chance of getting his toe over the lintel, said a public relations manager at the five-star hotel JW Marriot.
""The Hong Kong police is very much involved. From the 28th, guests coming in and out must go through metal detectors, just like in airports,"" manager Peachie Dieken said.
JW Marriot will be playing host to 11 heads of state, and some rooms have even been reserved for police officers during the handover, in case they are needed for any emergency.
"
TanEeLyn,"Internationally-known Hong Kong democracy campaigner Martin Lee, long branded a ""subversive"" by Beijing, plans to stay here and fight on for civil liberties under China's rule.
He has no foreign passport in his back pocket. Lee, leader of Hong Kong's democracy movement, says he has no intention of taking flight before or after midnight June 30 when Britain hands the territory back to China.
Lee's bookish, soft-spoken demeanour belies his skill as a political maestro winning audiences in the West in a long, dogged fight for freedoms in Hong Kong.
The 58-year-old leader of Hong Kong's largest political group, the Democratic Party, became China's marked man the day he stood up before formidable Communist Party elders, including the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
In the Great Hall of the People in Beijing he gave them a polite but stern lecture.
""What do you mean by people who love China or love Hong Kong? Do you mean people who would say things the leaders of China would like to hear?"" the bespectacled Lee grilled them.
""Or do you mean these are people who genuinely love Hong Kong and would say honest things about Hong Kong--although maybe critical of the Chinese government?"" he asked.
Lee's lecture harked back to a day in 1987, when he questioned Deng who earlier promised a time of great prosperity for everyone who ""loves China and loves Hong Kong"" after the British colony of 156 years is handed back to Beijing.
His powerful and elderly audience appeared shocked by his forthright tone but they will get their own back very soon.
At midnight June 30, Lee loses his seat in Hong Kong's elected legislative council, which will be disbanded to make way for a provisional legislature, which China supports.
But the criminal lawyer with a successful practice does not intend to call his political career quits, let alone flee.
""This is my home and I don't intend to leave at all,"" Lee said in a recent interview. ""If you really want to achieve democracy then you must stay to fight for it, once you leave there is very little you can do.""
Son of a Nationalist (Kuomintang) general and the sixth of seven children, Lee was born in Hong Kong in 1938. He graduated from the University of Hong Kong and took his first job at a secondary school teaching English history and Bible studies.
The devout Catholic later left for London to read law before returning in 1966 to start his own practice.
His entry into politics came in 1985 when he was elected to the legislative council to represent the legal profession.
""My little worm of conscience made me ask what I had done for the community, having taken so much out of it,"" he once said.
A firm believer in humanitarian values, Lee has not looked back since. Loudly critical of both Britain and China, Lee has travelled the world to lobby for international pressure to keep China in check and highlight problems of Hong Kong's handover.
""Listen to Hong Kong people. There is no doubt that the people of Hong Kong want democracy, human rights and the rule of law,"" he wrote in a recent article in a British newspaper.
""Don't sacrifice Hong Kong for trade with China. Don't bow to economic blackmail or to the entirely predictable insistence of Beijing's leaders that Hong Kong is China's internal affair,"" Lee said, targeting British leaders.
His most prominent success came in April when he won an audience at the White House and a pledge from President Bill Clinton that Hong Kong's freedoms will be looked after.
Lee has been constantly attacked by pro-China politicians and even Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa has accused him of ""badmouthing"" the territory abroad.
But Lee refuses to give up and he vows to fight elections, scheduled in mid-1998.
""We'll continue to work for Hong Kong people and we'll continue with our fight for democracy, freedoms and the rule of law and human rights...""We'll continue to be the voice of Hong Kong,"" he said.
"
TanEeLyn,"A stunning dazzle of laser beams and dozens of powerful search lights dancing to music will illuminate Hong Kong's famous harbourfront skyline on the night of July 1, when the territory is once more a part of China.
It will be a night at the harbour Hong Kong will never forget, organisers said, and the hour-long extravaganza, which includes a parade of giant lanterns, will end in final big bang with the largest ever display of fireworks.
Neon lights, which have come to typify Hong Kong's skyline by night, will be shut off just before the show and turned on during a ""dramatic moment"" in the laser beam display, they said. Dubbed the ""Hong Kong 97 Spectacular"", organisers said they just want the territory of 6.4 million, which Britain will hand back to China at midnight on June 30, to have fun.
""After the politics is over, it's time for everyone to have fun,"" said Adam Bezark, show director and writer, who started planning the show last November.
Organised by the privately funded Better Hong Kong Foundation, the HK$100 million (US$13 million) extravaganza is sponsored by corporate giants in the territory.
""It's a gift from Hong Kong to Hong Kong,"" Bezark said.
In just 10 days Hong Kong, a British-ruled colony for over 150 years, will return to the Chinese fold.
Over 4,000 VIPs including heads of state are due to descend on Hong Kong and, in a land famed for its punctiliousness, last-minute preparations for the historic changeover are proceeding at clockwork efficiency.
Fairy lights now adorn bridges and buildings fronting the harbour. At the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Centre, where the midnight handover ceremony will be held, workers are putting the finishing touches to a new wing built for the event.
The entire territory has undergone a drastic transformation in the run-up to the handover. Miniature flags of China and the future Hong Kong, depicting the tropical hybrid bauhinia flower, are strung up in residential estates.
On a more serious note, police carried out their first extensive search for suspicious objects around areas of the handover ceremony venue on Friday and would keep up vigilance until all the main festivities are over around July 2.
""Around 2,000 police officers will guard the cordoned-off areas, especially during the peak dates between June 28 and July 2"", a police spokeswoman told Reuters.
The event has prompted a proliferation of 1997 souvenirs and China entrepreneurs, too, are cashing in on the fever.
Wine maker Dynasty has just shipped in hundreds of crates of a new edition, which it boasts is ""The Official 1997 Wine"" and retails now at HK$119 (US$15.4).
""By Special Appointment of the Association for Celebration of Reunification of Hong Kong with China"", its label says.

TheresePoletti,"America Online Inc signed a hefty marketing pact with little-known long distance provider Tel-Save Holdings Inc, immediately giving AOL a big chunk of cash and Tel-Save access to eight million AOL users.
AOL and Tel-Save signed a deal to offer AOL members lower-cost long distance telephone service through Tel-Save, which AOL will promote and market to its members. AOL will get an upfront payment of $100 milllion in cash from Tel-Save, a telecommunications service provider based in New Hope, Pa.
AOL will also get warrants to buy Tel-Save shares.  
Analysts and AOL said that the deal was a boost for the company because it showed that AOL was able to put a big value on its growing subscriber base and that it can derive revenues from sources other than subscriber fees.
""This is a proof of promise,"" said Bob Pittman, chief executive of AOL Networks. ""This is not a deal a search engine could do because they don't have the assets. We have put a number on it and we have another $100 million in our coffers.""
While AOL has ""plenty of cash"" for its business plan, the Tel-Save deal will provide funds for general corporate purposes, though AOL must pay the $100 million back, he said.  
Analysts said that the first $43 million must be paid back over ten quarters, beginning in its fourth quarter. That is when the online company will start marketing the Tel-Save long-distance service to its members, thruogh pop-up screens asking them if they wish to enroll. A sampling will begin this summer.
Tel-Save currently offers long-distance and wireless service to about 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses. Tel-Save said its long-distance service featured lower costs than services offered by AT&amp;T Corp, MCI Communications Inc and Sprint Corp.
""These subscribers are the cream of the crop,"" said Dan Borislow, chief executive of Tel-Save. ""This is a great use of our cash."" He declined to estimate how many AOL members may sign up for its long-distance service.
AOL's warrants will let the company buy shares of Tel-Save at strike prices ranging from $14.00 to $15.50, for up to 12 million shares, if the total number of AOL members using Tel-Save reaches 3.5 million subscribers.
""They (AOL) could wind up owning over a third of this company,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co analyst.
Tel-Sav's shares jumped 7-3/8 to 20-1/2 on Tuesday.  
To be sure, some analysts cautioned that AOL will have to compete against long-distance companies that spend billions of dollars on marketing.
""This will be the ultimate test of AOL's marketing prowess,"" said David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments. ""It's AOL against 'the dime lady,'"" he added, referring to Sprint's popular television commercials featuring actress Candice Bergen.
"
TheresePoletti,"AT&amp;T Corp. -- a year after the much-hyped launch of its Internet access service had consumers clamouring for software -- said Wednesday it will end its introductory offer of free Internet access to long-distance customers.
The telecommunications giant said that after March 31 a revised pricing plan for its WorldNet Service will go into effect, but that it will continue to offer its flat-rate pricing plan of $19.95 a month for unlimited access.
AT&amp;T also said it began posting statistics about the reliability and performance of WorldNet. It challenged other service providers to match its performance, a jab at America Online Inc., which has experienced major congestion problems when its members swamped the service after it switched to flat-rate pricing in December.
""We always said it would be a one-year promotion,"" Tom Evslin, vice president of WorldNet, told reporters in a conference call. ""It served its purpose of introducing many people to the Internet.
""Things were very different a year ago. Now, you can't turn on a sports event without seeing the URL of each team,"" he said, referring to World Wide Web site addresses known as uniform resource locators (URLs).
WorldNet has more than 750,000 members and said it is the largest ""pure Internet"" access provider in the United States. ""Pure Internet"" services offer Internet access only and little or no proprietary content like that provided by America Online Inc. and CompuServe Corp.
Starting March 31, AT&amp;T will offer long-distance customers who sign up for WorldNet and anticipate lower usage a monthly rate of $4.95 for their first five hours.
Long-distance customers who signed up before March 31 will continue to get their first five hours for free for a year and will be enrolled under the revised pricing after that.
Customers of long-distance carriers other than AT&amp;T can receive the service for $4.95 for the first three hours.
All hourly plan customers pay $2.50 for each additional hour and pay separately for phone access or toll-free 800 number access to reach the service.
When AT&amp;T introduced WorldNet with flat-rate pricing a year ago, it shocked the online services industry, which feared competition from the telecommuniations giant with access to so many long-distance telephone customers.
But still, analysts said that AT&amp;T must be disappointed with its current subscriber count of over 750,000, since its entry into the online services was so feared and analysts estimated it would rapidly gain millions of users.
By contrast, No. 1 online service AOL has over 8 million subscribers.
""It's safe to say they must be disappointed with their subscriber growth,"" said Gregory Wester, a research director at the Yankee Group. ""They have a 60 percent share of the long-distance market and a single-digit share of Internet access mareket."" Wester uses 18 million users as the current number of the total Internet access market.
AT&amp;T stock dropped 37.5 cents to $40.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

TheresePoletti,"International Business Machines Corp. and 15 U.S. and Canadian banks announced Monday that they had formed a company to offer a broad range of electronic banking services in North America, the latest in several ventures seeking to jump start banking from home PCs.
The company, the Integrion Financial Network, will offer interactive banking and electronic commerce services to U.S. and Canadian banks beginning early next year.
""With this new venture, electronic commerce will take its biggest step to date,"" IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner told a news conference, in a rare public appearance. ""Integrion is the customer pathway to an array of services ... that no bank could provide alone.""
Integrion will develop an electronic bill payment system and provide software to connect to its network for member banks' customers. Consumers will also be able to access the network via the Internet or any commercial online service.
Electronic commerce, in which consumers buy goods and services via computer, could grow to $600 billion a year within 10 years, Gerstner said. By contrast, electronic commerce now runs at only about $700 million a year, he said.
""The demand is there,"" Barnett Banks Inc. Chief Executive Charles Rice told the news conference.
""There is a very important parallel here,"" said Gerstner, who was once also the president of American Express. ""A group of banks created a product called credit cards... That is exactly what I think will happen here.""
Gerstner said he believed Integrion was providing a system and a platform for a whole new banking service opportunity.
Gerstner said he hoped that companies like Intuit Inc., which has its own set of deals with banks for electronic banking software, would develop versions of its popular Quicken personal financial software for Integrion.
In addition to Barnett, banks teaming up with IBM include BankAmerica Corp., the Royal Bank of Canada, Fleet Financial Group Inc. and Banc One Corp.
Integrion will be owned and operated by the member banks and IBM. It will be open to all banks in North America.
Gerstner said his company would make money from the venture by selling the services of its Global Network and other services. He said Integrion is a for-profit company but that the companies involved will make money through electronic banking services.
Gerstner was not specific on what kind of revenues IBM or any of the companies involved were expecting from the venture.
The companies said they will use the IBM Global Network as the base network for electronic banking, a proprietary network maintained by IBM and used by many corporations as their own network or to conduct commerce with other companies.
Several bankers attending the news conference said the partnership with IBM would lower the cost of developing technology for electronic banking.
The companies said the most sensitive banking transactions will run over the IBM network, which they said is more secure than the Internet, but with connections to the Net.
Gerstner said while the Internet has become a totally new communications medium in the past two years, it is still not yet the ""holy grail"" companies have hoped for.
""The payoff is what these institutions do with this,"" Gerstner said.
Some analysts, however, said if the alliance took too long to get its software out the door, it could run the risk of being overshadowed by recent developments in Internet security, such as the use of longer encryption codes and digital signatures which verify the author of a transaction.
""The marketplace has changed a lot in the past two years,"" said Karen Epper, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""There has been a marked change in the perception of the Internet. The security options that are coming into existence now will make online banking more secure than even private dial-up.""
""The Internet seems best suited for sharing information and not for conducting (business) because of the lack of security,"" Robert Gillespie, chief executive of KeyCorp, one of the bank partners with IBM said. ""We think the reason its grown rather slowly in terms of commerce being conducted is because of the lack of a private secure network to do transactions on.""
Epper pointed out that some banks, such as Wells Fargo Co. and BankAmerica Corp. already offer customers the ability to pay bills and access their accounts, via the banks' Web sites.
Other banks teaming up with IBM are ABN AMRO Bank NV, Comerica Inc., First Bank System Inc., First Chicago NBD Corp., KeyCorp., Mellon Bank Corp., Michigan National Corp., NationsBank Corp., PNC Bank and Washington Mutual Savings Bank.

TheresePoletti,"America Online Inc. signed a hefty marketing pact Tuesday with little-known long-distance provider Tel-Save Holdings Inc., immediately giving the online service a big chunk of cash and Tel-Save access to 8 million America Online subscribers.
The two companies signed a deal to offer America Online members lower-cost long-distance telephone service through Tel-Save, which America Online will promote and sell to its members.
America Online will get an upfront payment of $100 million in cash from Tel-Save, a telecommunications provider based in New Hope, Pa. The online service will also get warrants to buy Tel-Save shares.
The announcement fuelled a rally by Tel-Save stock, which climbed $7.375 to $20.50 on Nasdaq, making it one of the biggest percentage gainers on the exchange.
America Online stock rose $1.125 to $36.625 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts and America Online said the deal was a boost for the world's No. 1 online service because it showed the company was able to put a big value on its growing subscriber base and that it could derive revenues from sources other than subscriber fees.
""This is a proof of promise,"" Bob Pittman, chief executive officer of AOL Networks, said in an interview. ""This is not a deal a (Web) search engine could do because they don't have the assets. We have put a number on it and we have another $100 million in our coffers.""
Pittman said that while Dulles, Va.-based America Online currently has ""plenty of cash"" for its business plan, this is additional cash for general corporate purposes. But America Online must pay the $100 million back.
Analysts said the first $43 million must be paid back over 10 quarters, beginning in its fourth quarter, when America Online begins to market the Tel-Save long-distance service to its members, through pop-up screens which will ask members if they wish to enroll. A sampling will begin this summer.
Tel-Save currently offers long-distance and wireless service to about 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses. Tel-Save said its long-distance service costs less than that from giants like AT&amp;T Corp., MCI Communications Inc. and Sprint Corp.
""These subscribers are the cream of the crop,"" said Dan Borislow, chief executive of Tel-Save. ""This is a great use of our cash."" He declined to estimate how many America Online members may sign up for long-distance service.
America Online's warrants will allow it to buy shares of Tel-Save at prices ranging from $14 to $15.50, for up to 12 million shares, if the total number of America Online members using Tel-Save reaches 3.5 million subscribers. ""They (AOL) could wind up owning over a third of this company,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst.
However, some analysts pointed out that America Online will be competing against the long-distance companies, which spend billions of dollars on marketing.
""This will be the ultimate test of AOL's marketing prowess,"" said David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments.
""It's AOL against 'The Dime Lady,'"" he added, referring to Sprint's popular television commercials featuring actress Candice Bergen.

TheresePoletti,"The stock of networking software company Citrix Systems Inc. lost almost 60 percent of its value Thursday amid concerns that its core product might face competition from industry behemoth Microsoft Corp.
Citrix shares tumbled $15.625 to $10.625 in heavy trading, with over 13.8 million shares changing hands.
Late Wednesday, Citrix said it was told by Microsoft that Microsoft was looking to develop multi-user features in its increasingly popular Windows NT operating system that would compete with Citrix's WinFrame software that lets users of multiple computers acccess Windows NT.
Microsoft later said it does have a product team working on such a software project, Microsoft Senior Vice President Jim Allchin said Thursday.
""We have a development team under way,"" Allchin said in a phone interview. He also said Microsoft is ""always talking"" to other companies about licensing technology.
Allchin said Microsoft will end up offering the multi-user capability to its users in Windows NT, but it has yet to decide if the technology will come from its own development, from Citrix, or from another company.
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Citrix said Wednesday that if Microsoft decided to develop features that would compete with its WinFrame technology, it would hurt Citrix's finances, but it did not give any specifics.
A Citrix spokeswoman said the licensing talks were continuing and that its relationship with Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft ""remains strong."" A Microsoft spokeswoman said that the talks between the two are continuing and nothing is final.
Microsoft Treasurer Greg Maffei is a member of Citrix's board of directors, and Microsoft owns an equity stake of about 6 percent of Citrix.
Microsoft's Allchin said, ""Customers are asking for this.... It's a natural extension of the family that we already have. It should not be a surprise to anyone. It's just another part of the Windows family.""
Last year Microsoft introduced Windows CE, a slimmed-down version of Windows and applications for personal digital assistants and consumer devices in the future.
Allchin said Microsoft already has a team of ""reasonable"" size working on developing multi-user capability, which would allow, with remote access, users on multiple devices ranging from personal digital assistants, PCs, so-called network computers, laptops and other devices, to access a server running Windows NT and applications.
Last month, Citrix reported record revenues of $15.6 million in the fourth quarter, up from $5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The company said that its strong quarter reflected the momentum in the Windows NT marketplace.

TheresePoletti,"JAMtv, a six-month-old online company started by a Chicago music promoter, hopes to turn the personal computer into a personalized jukebox.
As a first step, the company will unveil on Monday a music network on the Internet using multimedia technology from Intel Corp.
JAMtv plans to broadcast live concerts, link with radio stations for other programming, sell CDs and other merchandise and provide daily news and reviews.
The company is also working with privately held BackWeb, one of the leading ""push"" technology companies, which broadcasts personalized news and information directly to a person's PC.
""The goal is that you will have your own personal jukebox on your computer,"" Howard Tullman, chief executive of JAMtv, said.
JAMtv spun out from Jam Productions Ltd, a well-known concert producer and promoter in Chicago whose co-founder, Jerry Mickelsen, is chairman.
The company hopes its network will become the main source of music on the Internet, featuring contemporary and alternative rock arists and eventually country and jazz.
But JAMtv is not trying to be the MTV of the Internet, Tullman stressed.
He noted that in recent years MTV has had to change its programming to offer more shows and features, like the ""Real World"" soap opera, because MTV viewers tired of someone else making their programming decisions for them.
""It's a network of one,"" Tullman said of the planned JAMtv service.
""Anytime you go there, you can listen to what you want. You don't have to wait for someone to make these programming decisions for you,"" he said. ""We will let you design your profile and what you want.""
He said the JAMtv site on the World Wide Web will have daily events, with a calender of more than 1,500 events already planned for this year based on upcoming Jam Productions events, such as a U2 concert in Soldier Field in Chicago as part of the group's tour.
Users of the JAMtv site can also buy from a catalog of more than 140,000 music CDs, 70,000 music and entertainment videos and access an archive of images, audio, video and other data on hundreds of artists.
Tullman also said JAMtv was talking to computer makers and to Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Commuications Corp. in an effort in get a spot on the Windows desktop and a part of the Netscape browser, so that users will be able to simply click on an icon and have their JAMtv.
JAMtv is also embracing Intel's ""hybrid"" method of sending fat audio and video files over the Internet, by providing users with compact disks of some audio and video, which is then supplemented by updated audio and video streams sent over the Internet.
The company hopes to make money is several ways, by selling merchandise over the Internet, by selling advertising and licensing fees to radio affiliates for programming and through compiling databases on subscribers which it could sell to record companies.
Ultimately, Tullman said, a big JAMtv revenue stream will come from a ""pay-per-view"" distribution of live concerts on the Internet.
""At the end of the day, when you can truly go home at night and click on your PC and watch any concert you want, there will be pay per view revenues in this business,"" Tullman said.

TheresePoletti,"International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday introduced its next generation mainframe computer family, with systems twice as fast as currently available models, in a product launch widely anticipated by its customers.
""The feedback is phenomenal,"" said Ross Mauri, vice president of System 390 hardware developnment, in a phone interview. ""We have seen quite a bit of demand out there.""
""Customers have been enthusiastic about embracing the new server,"" Mauri said, adding that it is likely that IBM will be ""sold out of what we can produce this year,"" based on the initial customer reaction.
Mainframes are giant computers that store the data of the biggest corporations around the world. They are used by banks for transactions, by airlines for reservations systems, and by insurance companies for claims processing.
While many analysts have predicted the demise of these giant computers as more companies move to PC-based networks, mainframes have staged somewhat of a comeback as huge repositories of data that is accessible via the Internet and internal networks known as intranets.
The new mainframe servers use the third generation of IBM's lower-cost processor technology, called CMOS. The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology is a process that uses microprocessor technology that is less costly to build and less expensive for customers to maintain.
IBM introduced two new lines of System 390 servers, or computers that manage networks.
One family, called the IBM S/390 Parallel Entreprise Server, has 13 models designed specifically for heavy data storage and for transaction intensive companies.
The second server line, the IBM S/390 Multiprise 2000, is aimed at medium-sized customers who are currently using IBM S/390 mainframes, but wish to increase their computing power. The Multiprise is also aimed at customers who wish to buy an entire package, with software and storage systems.
So far, IBM has installed about 14 of the S/390 Parallel Enterprise Servers - Generation 3 in an early customer programme. IBM has also installed three of the S/390 Multiprise.
IBM also said it introduced an upgrade of its mainframe operating system, called OS/390 Release 2, which provides more connectivity for customers to computer networks such as the Internet and UNIX based systems. IBM also introduced other software products for better network computing over the S/390.
IBM also introduced new mainframe disk storage products for improved data reliabilty.
IBM declined to give any price details on the new models, saying that it tailors each systems to unique customer needs and that customers are now familiar with the lower prices of CMOS-based mainframes.
""As you make the transition from bipolar to CMOS, you see a significant price reduction,"" said Mauri. ""Customers already have an understanding of that.""
Bipolar refers to the process technology that IBM used in its older mainframe models. Three years ago, IBM began preparing its customers for a big transition to a new, lower-cost machine, designed around microprocessors.
Analysts said the new mainframes run at speeds of around 45 million instructions per second (MIPS), twice as fast as the currently available speeds of 22 million instructions per second for the fastest CMOS models, bringing the systems up to the speeds of the older bipolar machines, and at a lower cost.
Even with the prices of these huge milllion dollar systems falling, mainframes are still IBM's biggest revenue producing hardware. Analysts are hoping for a big uptick in fourth quarter earnings, in part due to mainframes, because the lower-cost models are more profitable to IBM.
""These are all necessary announcements for IBM,"" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst, adding that the products are important to IBM's future earnings.
IBM said the new models will be available next month.
""The mainframe as we once knew it, where MIPS were expensive, we are never going to see that again,"" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. ""IBM has re-engineered the mainframe, they don't even want to call it a mainframe anymore, they call it a server.""

TheresePoletti,"Former NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff Monday was named chairman of the board of America Online Inc.'s original content developer, Greenhouse Networks, as part of a major initiative to create specialized online networks. The company's stock soared.
The world's No. 1 online service also said it was buying LightSpeed Media Inc., a pioneer producer of Internet soap operas and shows. Financial terms were not disclosed.
As part of the deal, Vienna, Va.-based Greenhouse Networks said it would develop an interactive entertainment network, slated for launch this fall on AOL and the Internet.
America Online stock rose $5, or more than 11 percent, to $47 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was seventh leading percentage gainer for the day.
AOL's entertainment network will be based in Los Angeles and will capitalize on Lightspeed's and Tartikoff's relationships in the entertainment industry.
America Online's deal with Tartikoff expands a previous arrangement announced last fall for the executive to develop original interactive brands to be launched simultaneously online, on television and as books.
Tartikoff, who was president of NBC Entertainment from 1980 to 1991, currently heads his own television and production company, H. Beale Co., in Los Angeles. During his tenure at NBC, the network made its rise to the No. 1 network with shows such as ""Hill Street Blues,"" ""Cheers,"" ""L.A. Law,"" and ""Family Ties.""
From 1991 to 1992, he was chairman of Paramount Pictures when that studio released hit movies such as ""Wayne's World"" and ""Patriot Games.""
Analysts called the expansion of Tartikoff's role a ""major coup"" for the online service, as it hopes to move toward developing its own content instead of just investing in companies that develop content for AOL.
The Greenhouse Network's Motley Fool personal finance area is one of the most successful of the over 30 Greenhouse investments. The founders of Motley Fool have authored books, articles and the Motley Fool is now a logo found on baseball hats, T-shirts and other merchandise.
Tartikoff ""developed NBC into the powerhouse of the 1980s,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with Arlen Communications Inc. in Bethesda, Md. ""He has these concepts and he gets them down. ... They are hoping to get a major hit that is so big they will be able to merchandise it.""
Tartikoff's first project with Greenhouse and AOL will be called ""Beggars and Choosers,"" a serial about a struggling TV network, which is being developed to launch simultaneously on AOL and as a made-for-TV movie for the Showtime cable channel.
Tartikoff will continue to head his own production company and act as a consultant and adviser to America Online as chairman of Greenhouse, America Online said.
LightSpeed's founders were behind the first so-called ""episodic"" show on the Internet, called ""The Spot,"" which it sold to American Cybercast in early 1996. ""The Spot,"" an interactive soap opera about five people sharing a beach house in California, is still on the Web site of American Cybercast, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.
LightSpeed was founded in May 1996 by the creators of ""The Spot,"" after American Cybercast bought the program. Founder Scott Zakarin will be named president of programming.
Zakarin and his team launched another popular Internet soap -- ""GrapeJam"" -- last August.
America Online executives said Internet soap operas will be only one small part of its broad entertainment network, which will feature celebrity hosts, live events, news and other information about the entertainment industry.
""The focus (of the network) is on the entertainment industry and the entertainment business,"" said Greenhouse President Danny Krifcher. He declined to say how many staffers it will have, or what its projected revenues will be.
America Online plans to make money from the entertainment network through advertising revenues, licensing and through transactions, such as selling tickets to entertainment events, selling merchandise and offering premium information at a surcharge. But Krifcher declined to make any forecasts.
The closest competition America Online said it has on the Internet to its entertainment network are sites such as Mr. Showbiz, E! Online and a People magazine site devoted to entertainment. Analysts said AOL's biggest competition is Microsoft Corp.'s MP3 multimedia studio.
""This is a very big opportunity,"" Krifcher said. ""This is the beginning of what we think will be a series of exciting announcements and developments for us.""
Greenhouse also plans to launch other programming networks specializing in sports, romance, young adults, health and women. The networks will include content of current Greenhouse properties and new ones, to be distributed over AOL, the Internet and other platforms such as TV and books.
""Greenhouse is no longer just a venture capital company,"" Krasilovsky said. ""They are hoping to develop full media properties in their own right.""

TheresePoletti,"Some of Microsoft Corp.'s biggest corporate foes  -- including International Business Machines Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. -- said Tuesday they were collaborating on network computing standards that will enable their products to work together seamlessly.
The companies, which also include Oracle Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., said the standards resulting from the collaboration would allow software developers to build diverse software to connect computers via corporate networks, business-to-business networks and the Internet.
They said their collaboration was open to broad industry participation.
""This initiative starts with four companies, but our goal is for an industry groundswell to develop,"" said Steve Mills, general manager of IBM Software Solutions.
Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, has been criticised by others in the industry and computer users for trying to extend its domination in various areas by developing software based on closed, proprietary standards.
This is a particularly sensitive issue for the Internet, which for many years has operated according to so-called open standards.
IBM, Oracle, Sun and Netscape said the results of their collaboration would be submitted to an industry standards group later this year. Microsoft is part of the industry standards group as well.
Each company pledged to make their next major products adhere to the standards this year.
The goal of the collaboration is to have a unified approach to an Internet development architecture -- called CORBA, or common object request broker architecture -- so that software from these companies can use objects developed by others.
For example, Netscape's Communicator software will be able to access objects, or pieces of reusable code, stored in a big IBM or Oracle database.
Microsoft's stock dropped $1.625 to $98.375 on Nasdaq, while IBM dipped 12.5 cents to $146 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Oracle was down 25 cents at $35.75, Sun Microsystems rose 50 cents to $31.75 and Netscape dropped $1.875 to $27.75, all on Nasdaq.

TheresePoletti,"International Business Machines Corp.'s $23 billion Global Services business will become a separate IBM group, the company announced Wednesday, acknowledging the significance of the fast-growing business.
In a related development, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner reiterated in the company's annual report an earlier statement that it planned to hire ""thousands more"" employees to fuel growth, most of them in Global Services.
IBM told analysts earlier this year it will probably add as many new employees in 1997 as it did in 1996, with a big chunk in Global Services.
In 1996, the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant's worldwide head count grew to 241,000, up from 225,000 in 1995, mostly due to the expanding services business, an IBM spokesman said. In 1995, employment grew from 220,000 in 1994, the first time employment grew in 10 years.
""I'd like to add here that I am very happy -- and proud -- that our transformation has created job growth,"" Gerstner said in his letter to shareholders, in which he described 1996 overall as ""a solid year.""
When Gerstner first took over the then-struggling computer giant in April 1993, one of his first actions was to take a whopping restructuring charge and cut 25,000 jobs from IBM.
The Global Services unit -- which designs, installs and services computers, including running entire corporate computer systems -- was formerly part of IBM's Sales and Services group.
Sales and Services will be renamed the Sales and Distribution Group, still headed by IBM Senior Vice President Ned Lautenbach.
IBM also said Dennie Welsh, who was general manager of Global Services, will be promoted to a senior vice president and report directly to Gerstner.
Welsh was also named an IBM group executive and will join IBM's executive committee, which makes strategic decisions.
""The time is right for this change,"" Gerstner said in an IBM memo announcing the reorganization. ""He (Welsh) and his colleagues on the services team have done an outstanding job building a great new business for IBM. This change not only reflects a logical adjustment in our organisational structure, but also a recognition of their success.""
IBM's services business has been its fastest growing in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, IBM said services revenues jumped 22 percent to $5 billion. In comparison, IBM's total revenues grew 6 percent in the fourth quarter.
""This is a transformation of the IBM company,"" said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant. ""The major revenue stream is not coming from hardware, it will come from software and services ..."".
""This has some impact on the way IBM sees its future,"" Albert added. ""Anything this important demands direct oversight by Gerstner.""
Wednesday's move follows changes in December when IBM consolidated computer services under the IBM Global Services brand. IBM's services organisation had been operating in some countries outside the United States under different names.
The addition of Global Services now gives IBM five major corporate divisions. The others are the Software Group, the Server Group, which makes the computers that run networks; the Personal Systems Group; and Sales and Distribution.
With Welsh's promotion to IBM senior vice president, the company now has a total of 10 senior vice presidents.
IBM stock fell $1.50 to $137.857 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"
TheresePoletti,"International Business Machines Corp said its $23 billion Global Services business is to become a separate IBM group, acknowledging the significance of the fast-growing business.
In a related development, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner reiterated in the company's annual report on Wednesday that the company planned to hire ""thousands more"" employees to fuel growth, most of them in Global Services.
IBM told analysts earlier this year it would probably add as many new employees in 1997 as it did in 1996, with a big chunk in Global Services.
In 1996, the computer giant's worldwide headcount grew to 241,000, up from 225,000 in 1995, mostly due to the expanding services business, an IBM spokesman said. In 1995, employment grew from 220,000 in 1994, the first time employment had grown in 10 years.
""I'd like to add here that I am very happy -- and proud -- that our transformation has created job growth,"" Gerstner said in his letter to shareholders, in which he described 1996 overall as ""a solid year.""
When Gerstner first took over the then-struggling computer giant in April 1993, one of his first actions was to take a big restructuring charge and cut 25,000 jobs from IBM.
The Global Services unit -- which designs, installs and services computers, including running entire corporate computer systems -- was formerly part of IBM's Sales and Services group.
Sales and Services will be renamed the Sales and Distribution Group, still headed by IBM Senior Vice President Ned Lautenbach.
IBM also said Dennie Welsh, who was general manager of Global Services, will be promoted to a senior vice president and report directly to Gerstner.
Welsh was also named an IBM group executive and will join IBM's executive committee, which makes strategic decisions.
""The time is right for this change,"" Gerstner said in an IBM memo announcing the reorganisation. ""He (Welsh) and his colleagues on the services team have done an outstanding job building a great new business for IBM. This change not only reflects a logical adjustment in our organisational structure, but also a recognition of their success.""
IBM's services business has been its fastest growing in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, IBM said services revenues jumped 22 percent to $5 billion. In comparison, IBM's total revenues grew 6 percent in the fourth quarter.
""This is a transformation of the IBM company,"" said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant. ""The major revenue stream is not coming from hardware, it will come from software and services ..."".
""This has some impact on the way IBM sees its future,"" Albert added. ""Anything this important demands direct oversight by Gerstner.""

TheresePoletti,"IBM shares fell in heavy trading Friday after three Wall Street firms made negative comments about the giant computer maker in the past two days, saying a stronger dollar and a product transition will hurt earnings.
The stock of International Business Machines Corp. fell $4.25 to $132.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the fourth most-active issue with more than 5.3 million shares traded.
""People are beginning to realise that it's going to be a bleak quarter,"" said Jay Stevens, analyst at Dean Witter. But he continued to recommend accumulating IBM stock.
Analysts said two main factors were hurting IBM's earnings prospects. Even though the world's largest computer maker will have a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding due to its share buyback plan, currency fluctuations and expected weakness in mainframe sales will hurt the first half of 1997, they said.
Morgan Stanley on Friday cut its earnings estimates for IBM, saying that the Armonk, N.Y.-based company will make more money toward the end of the year instead of earlier. It also said results will be affected by currency fluctuations and the transition to a new mainframe model.
""Some users may wait for the new one,"" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst.
Morgan Stanley cut its earnings per share estimate to $2.80 from $2.97 for the second quarter and to $12.30 from $12.50 for all of 1997.
IBM earned $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share, on revenues of $23.1 billion in the 1996 fourth quarter. For full-year 1996, it reported profits of $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, on revenues of $75.95 billion.
Morgan Stanley continued to rate IBM's stock as an outperformer.
Analysts said IBM is expected to upgrade its low-cost mainframes to a processor with speeds that match its older bi-polar line that is being phased out.
""This is a major product transition,"" Stevens said.
Analysts have been expecting initial shipments of the new processors in the third quarter. Milunovich said he expects a few models will be shipped in June.
Merrill Lynch said on Thursday in a note to clients that it expects demand will be extremely good for the new machines and expects IBM to beat Wall Street's expectations of initial shipments in the third quarter.
But until then, the stronger dollar overseas will continue to weigh on earnings, the brokerage said.
Merrill did not change its current first-quarter estimate of $2.32 a share. But it expects 3 percent revenue growth in the first quarter and a tough comparison vs. a year ago.
Late Thursday, Dean Witter also lowered its 1997 earnings estimates for IBM, saying its operating income was expected to fall by 11 percent in the first quarter.
However, this is expected to be offset by a lower tax rate of 35 percent vs. a previous 39 percent, along with IBM's current stock repurchase plan, it said.
Dean Witter raised its earnings estimate for the second half of the year and kept its 1997 profit estimate at $14.25 per share.

TheresePoletti,"After two years of hype and euphoria about the Internet and its sweeping impact on the computer industry, a reality check is setting in as investors are asking: Where's the money?
A Tucson, Ariz., industry conference this week called PC Forum -- a ""schmooze fest"" once populated mostly by the upper echelon of the computer industry -- brought together telecommunications and media company leaders as well as those from computer behemoths and start-ups.
Many attendees said there is more concern now about profits and business models.
""It's now coming to practical terms,"" said Ed Bennett, former president of the Prodigy Services online service. ""Where is the money coming from? ... But the raw potential of the industry hasn't changed, and that's a good thing.""
So far, it is still not clear what type of business plan will lead to hefty revenues and profits from the Internet, whether it be advertising-based, subscription-based or some other way of making money.
Recent failures or financial problems at Web-based ventures, such as the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of American Cybercast, one of the first Web soap opera sites, are causing concern.
Executives also pointed to the recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Amazon.com, which pioneered bookselling on the Internet, for its anticipated initial public offering (IPO).
Seattle-based Amazon.com, known as one of the most successful ventures and best-known examples of Internet commerce, said it lost $5.8 million in 1996, mostly due to increased investments in technology and marketing.
""There is no question that there is an increased focus on the part of analysts and investors on when are they going to make money,"" said Sheldon Laube, chief technology officer of U.S. Web., a privately held Santa Clara, Calif. company which franchises Web development, training and consulting services.
""It's a healthy part of the evolution of the business,"" Laube said. ""The hype is now evolving into reality and ultimately that is what technology is all about.""
While the conference is a forum for discussing industry issues and exchanging ideas -- sometimes lofty and intellectual ones such as the use of metaphors and language to describe this new medium -- a number of small start-up companies come to make their debut before their peers. Industry executives, analysts and investors come to meet and make deals in the hallways.
This year, in the so-called ""debutantes"" presentations, many venture capitalists, Wall Street analysts and fund managers checked out 12 early start-ups.
The PC Forum, run by industry guru Esther Dyson, is considered such an important part of a start-up company's debut that Fast Company magazine followed around executives of two small companies to chronicle their participation at the conference.
""This is the 'Lollapalooza' of the Internet,"" Bennett said, who remains on Prodigy's board, referring to the alternative music festival. ""Not every band is going to get signed.""
This year, questions about business models dominated many start-up presentations more than the technology. During a presentation by a start-up called NetBot Inc., whose Internet ""shopping assistant"" made its debut, one attendee interrupted to ask about the Seattle-based firm's business model, even before the company demonstrated its software called Jango.
""People are much more pragmatic when they look at these companies,"" said Bruce Smith, a Merrill Lynch Internet analyst. ""You like to look at companies that have thought through their business model and how they will compete with the 800-pound gorilla (Microsoft Corp.).""
And as the stocks of other publicly traded companies such as Internet search engines firms like Yahoo! Inc., Excite Inc., and Lycos Inc. ; Internet access providers; online services and other Internet software companies continue to drop on Wall Street, start-ups compete for fewer and fewer venture capital dollars.
Some promising IPO candidates are also mulling being acquired, such as PointCast Inc.'s much-rumoured discussions two weeks ago to be acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the owner of the Fox television network and newspapers such as the New York Post.
PointCast, a pioneer in so-called push technology, said last week its present intention was to remain independent.
""In the venture capital business, you can see the transition from a seller's market to a buyer's market,"" said Roger McNamee, general partner at Integral Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. ""Entrepreneurs are beginning to wonder where their next dollar of capital will come from.""
Even in its new-found pragmatism, the industry remains ever optimistic about the future. Conference leader Dyson and many of the speakers gathered together at the end of the conference with the creator of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, who now heads up the World Wide Web Consortium.
""The competition is what produces the incredible rate of development,"" Berners-Lee said.

TheresePoletti,"CompuServe Corp is in talks to be acquired by America Online Inc, a move that would bring new members to AOL, beef up its network and expand its corporate and international presence, industry sources said on Wednesday.
Earlier, CompuServe and H&amp;R Block Inc confirmed market rumors that they were in discussions for a possible ""business combination"" involving CompuServe. Neither CompuServe nor H&amp;R Block, which owns about 80 percent of the computer online service, would provide further details.  
Industry sources said AOL was involved in talks to buy its beleaguered competitor, possibly in an all-stock transaction.
""It's part of the consolidation mechanism that is taking place in the marketplace,"" said Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects in Washington. ""They have had conversations off and on....Probably this conversation has gotten reasonably heavy since AOL got into problems having to spend all sorts of money on its network.""  
An H&amp;R Block spokeswomen said she could not elaborate on a statement that confirmed Block and CompuServe were engaged in external discussions regarding a possible business transaction with CompuServe.
AOL declined to comment on the market rumors of talks with CompuServe.  
While AOL shares jumped on Tuesday as rumors circulated in the market, the stock retreated 1-1/8 on Wednesday to 44-5/8, as some analysts said such a deal would prove distracting and costly for AOL, given its current problems achieving profitability.
""There is not a lot of value to the CompuServe subscriber base,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co analyst.
""There is no guarantee they would stay with AOL. It would be a very dilutive and distracting acquisition for AOL,"" he said. ""AOL is just about to turn profitable here, and we don't need them to buy a money-losing company.""  
""There is no good reason for AOL to buy CompuServe,"" said Abhishek Gami, a Nesbitt Burns Securities analyst. ""If AOL does buy them, it would be a major negative for AOL.""
He said a merger would raise the eyebrows of antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department because it would result in a big gain in AOL's share of the U.S. online services market.
AOL, the No.1 online service, currently has eight million members. CompuServe is second with 3.1 million in the United States and Europe and 2.2 million licensed members in Japan, where it receives royalty payments.  
However, AOL and CompuServe both provide Internet access, and that market has many more players than the proprietary online service business, where there are only four main providers.
Analysts said AOL would have to pay for any deal with stock because of its cash position is low. Its cash and equivalents were listed at $130 million at the end of 1996. Using AOL's stock to pay for the 92.6 million CompuServe shares outstanding (of which H&amp;R Block owns about 74 million) would dilute AOL's shares.
Despite the negative reactions, some analysts said a CompuServe merger could be appealing to AOL.  
Integration of the contrasting images of AOL and CompuServe could also present a big problem. AOL is mainly seen as a consumer online service, while CompuServe is more oriented to business customers and users with more technical sophistication.
Indeed, some analysts said it would be difficult to convert die-hard CompuServe users to AOL.
""Domestically, being a CompuServe user is almost a positive statement that one is not an AOL user,"" said Adam Schoenfeld, a Jupiter Communications analyst. ""AOL has probably already poached every CompuServe user possible.""     Some analysts said
that CompuServe might be a better match for one of the regional Bell operating companies, some of whom are still seeking to enter the Internet access business.
""It has a national network and a well-known brand name that could be reinvigorated,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with Arlen Communications Inc in Bethesda, Maryland. ""You don't want to count out the telcos.""

TheresePoletti,"The stock of International Business Machines Corp. fell in heavy trading on Thursday, hit by renewed fears about its first-quarter earnings after a published report focused on recent analysts' estimate cuts.
The sell-off fuelled the overall stock market's fourth sharp sell-off in five days as investors were already scared that Friday's March employment report, if robust, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again soon.
IBM fell as low as $128.875 before ending down $2.375 at $131.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the third most-active issue on volume of 4.6 million shares.
IBM shares began their tumble in London, where investors first read a Wall Street Journal article that said analysts may not be through cutting IBM's earnings estimates.
The report talked about a recent spate of analysts' estimate cuts, citing fears that a stronger dollar and a mainframe product transition will hurt IBM's first-quarter earnings, due April 23, and depress the stock even further. A strong dollar makes sales overseas worth less in dollar terms.
As previously reported, two weeks ago three Wall Street firms made negative comments and two lowered their estimates on IBM, fuelling a drop in IBM's shares in late March.
The report, which appeared as a ""Heard on the Street"" column in Thursday's Journal, also dredged up an almost two-week old rumour that IBM was going to pre-announce that its earnings would come in below analysts' estimates.
""The Wall Street Journal article today is a summation of old news,"" said John Jones of Salomon Brothers. ""We talked to IBM today and they have no plans for a pre-announcement.""
One trader said of the newspaper article: ""They are a bit late to the party here.""
""I heard the rumour but I wouldn't put any credence to it,"" said another trader.
An IBM spokesman declined to comment on the quarter.
As previously reported, on March 21, Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich cut IBM's 1997 earnings estimate to $12.30 a share from $12.50. For all of 1996, IBM earned $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share.
On March 20, Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Jay Stevens lowered his first-half earnings estimates for IBM, saying customers might hold off purchases of mainframes until an anticipated upgrade. Some analysts are expecting initial shipments in June.
Stevens added to his estimates for the second half of the year, however, saying the year would be more back-end loaded, as customers make purchases in the second half of the year.
Also in March, Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh said it would be tough for IBM's first-quarter earnings, which it estimated at $2.32 a share, to compare to the year-ago period's. The analysts' consensus estimate is $2.31 a share for the first quarter, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
For the first quarter of 1996, IBM posted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $2.48 a share, excluding charges associated with software acquisitions and other special items.
Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst, said he is maintaining his first-quarter earnings estimate of $2.32 a share, which he has had since February.
""It's going to be tough to make that number and I doubt that they can overachieve it,"" Helmig said. But he added that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed drastically since February, so he sees nothing new to affect his estimates.
The IBM drop caused the Dow Jones industrial average to lose 39.66 points to end at 6,477.35 after an initial plunge of more than 80 points.

TimFarrand,"Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever NV /Plc reported a 15 percent rise in annual profits on Tuesday and put its speciality chemicals units up for sale in a move tipped to raise up to five billion pounds.
Pre-tax profit rose to 2.66 billion pounds ($4.4 billion) last year on a six percent rise in turnover to 33.52 billion.
Unilever shares surged on the results, which were better than analysts had forecast, and on the planned speciality chemicals sale.
Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the sale of the speciality chemicals businesses would enable the group to concentrate on achieving growth in its consumer goods operations, particularly in developing and emerging markets.
Analysts said the sale, which could free Unilever up for a major acquisition in its main food, detergents and personal products businesses, was well timed.
FitzGerald said, meanwhile, that the overall economic situation in 1997, as in 1996, was likely to be generally favourable for the group, which is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, with activities from food to toiletries and household goods brands such as soap powder Omo.
But he saw little reason to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, would improve.
Analysts' forecasts for pre-tax profit had centred on 2.53 billion pounds and Unilever Plc shares surged 86-1/2 pence to 1,479-1/2 in London as some looked to raise 1997 forecasts.
In Amsterdam its shares rose 19.0 guilders, six percent, to 332.40.
""We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual (chemicals) businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two,"" FitzGerald told Reuters. ""We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months.""
FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses, with 15,800 staff in more than 35 countries, might be worth.
Analysts estimate the sale sould fetch 4.5 to 5.0 billion pounds and FitzGerald told a news conference in the short term it would wipe out the company's net borrowings of 1.7 billion pounds.
The funds would also be used for acquisitions in growth areas, FitzGerald told reporters, such as Asia Pacific and South America and in priority categories like detergents, tea, ice cream, yellow fats, personal care products and fragrances.
""We have a carefully defined list of what we may do with (the proceeds), which I am not prepared to discuss,"" he said. ""In China I would like to have a business 10 times the size.""
The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have a combined turnover of 3.0 billion pounds, nine percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million in 1996, with margins of 14.1 percent.
""These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,"" FitzGerald said.
""...if you look at the way this industry is developing we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business which is our mainstream consumer goods business.""
Commenting on the overall results, Unilever said its performance in Europe was held back by poor weather hitting ice cream sales and by the impact of the mad cow disease crisis.
But good progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results there and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets.
Unilever Plc is paying a final dividend of 21.76 pence, making 32.05 for the year, a rise of nine percent. The Dutch arm raised the final dividend to 4.75 guilders from 4.71, making a total of 6.98 against 6.19 in 1995. ($1=.6120 Pound)

TimFarrand,"Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever NV/Plc Tuesday reported a 15 percent rise in pre-tax profits for 1996 and said it was putting its speciality chemicals businesses up for sale.

Unilever's stock surged on the results, which were better than the 53 billion pounds ($4.13 billion) analysts had forecast, and the planned sale of the speciality chemicals businesses.
Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the overall economic situation in 1997 was likely to be generally favourable, as in 1996, but he warned about market conditions in Europe, particularly France and Germany.

The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined revenue of 3.0 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million pounds ($678 million) in 1996, with profit margins of 14.1 percent.
""These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses, but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require,"" FitzGerald said.
""They are essentially industrial businesses selling not to consumers but to intermediate customers. They are very fine businesses,"" he said. ""But if you look at the way this industry is developing, we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business, which is our mainstream consumer goods business.""
The four companies together make up one of the world's largest speciality chemicals groups, employing 15,800 people in more than 35 countries.
Unilever is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, and its activities span food, personal products, such as Pond's cold cream, and household goods brands, including laundry detergents and Lux soap.
In Europe, Unilever's overall results in 1996 were held back by the impact of poor weather on ice cream sales and the impact of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy beef crisis.
""We see little reason, however, to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, will improve,"" FitzGerald said.
Good progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results, and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets.

TimFarrand,"Brewer to leisure group Whitbread Plc can expect to raise about 100 million stg from the sale of its underperforming retail sites in 1997/98, said chief executive Peter Jarvis in an interview on Friday.
""We now have such a wide range of retail brands and a fast and sizeable programme of new openings, that we are able to dispose of older premises that simply cannot be upgraded,"" said Jarvis.
Recession in the early 1990's has made consumers more discerning so that they now pick their favoured restaurants and pubs more carefully, he said.
The company's 1,700 strong Whitbread Inns, which forms about 40 percent of group profits, added 80 sites this financial year and sold 50, with the modern sites generally much bigger and often designed to include a Travel Inn.
Some of the company's Beefeater restaurant-pubs are too old in design to be upgraded and other outlets are unlikely to prove economic over the medium term where for instance the local economy has turned down.
""We are constantly trying to improve the average within the portfolio,"" said Jarvis.
The advent of a more flexible property market -- in terms of lease back sale arrangements and fewer freeholds -- and much improved property prices will also enable Jarvis' sucessor David Thomas to accelerate the disposal and upgrade programme.
""He (Thomas) will be able to churn sites faster than I have been able to.""
""He is likely to dispose of more in the next five years than myself.""
Thomas will take over as chief executive in the summer when Jarvis steps down.

TimFarrand,"Brewer to leisure group Whitbread Plc has turned in a ""sound"" business performance in the last three months, said chief executive Peter Jarvis in an interview on Friday.
""The performance of core businesses in the last quarter of the year, December, January and Febuary, has been sound,"" said Jarvis.
The company reports its full year results ending February 28, 1997 on May 7.
""Whitbread Inns in that period have seen like-for-like sales growth in food and drink of between four and five percent. And overall their sales have been well into double digits.""
In mid January the company reported an eight percent increase in its sales in the five week period from December 1, 1996 compared with the previous year.
""Our beer company, particularly in takehome had a very strong christmas performance relative to the market. Our market share in takehome beer is the highest it has ever been,"" he added.
The group's ""beer volume for the year that is about to finish is well up on the market which is going to be one or two percent down.""
He said the refurbished pubs within the Whitbread Inn division -- like Brewers Fayre and Hogshead -- are performing very well.
""The returns that we are getting for the investment in new openings in the last six months are better than we have had historically.""
The group is converting its refurbished sites into profit quicker because they are opening them more quickly, he said.
Whitbread will open another 50 Pelican restaurants -- either Cafe Rouge or Cafe Dome -- by the end of the 1997 financial year, with plans to expand the chain to 300-400.
""And I think it will be relatively more successful as it moves out of London. Where we have opened in the provinces the performances are extremely good.""
Outside London there is less competition and customers view Cafe Rouge as a ""much more serious restaurant,"" whereas in London people tend to have one drink and move on and the average spend per head is therefore lower.
""Across the group we have a pipeline of new sites to open in the next 12 months which is the strongest pipeline we have ever had for the company -- we have 47 for Pelican, 45 Travel Inns, 80 managed pubs and 40 Costa Coffees.""
""It's a pipeline of at least 200 new outlets to be opened in the next year or so.""
The trend for eating out in Britain is growing fast and there is futher to go over the next decade, said Jarvis.
""The thing about the marketplace in Britain is that the percentage of money that people spend on eating out as a percentage of food is only about one-fifth as against half in the United States."" -- Tim Farrand, London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437.

TimFarrand,"Anglo-Dutch food to detergent company Unilever Plc/NV is unlikely to bid for French food group Danone as it would clash with its strategy and come up against big regulatory hurdles, said analysts.
""I think it would be unlikely,"" Paribas analyst John Campbell said on Thursday.
Unilever earlier would not comment on the rumours.
Since Unilever announced the sale of its speciality chemicals division earlier this month, expected to fetch some 5 billion stg, Unilever's name has been linked with a host of potential takeover targets including Cadbury-Schweppes and Reckitt and Coleman, sending their shares higher, but few of them fit the Unilever strategy, said analysts.
Cadbury-Schweppes, is too big in Britain and Unilever is reluctant to enter the soft drinks market especially in view of stiff competition from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, said analysts.
C-S would also bring with it relatively high debt levels -- net debt stood at 1.617 billion stg on June 15, 1996 and gearing at 121 percent, before the sale of its 51 percent stake in Coca Cola and Schweppes Beverages Ltd.
""I just don't think Danone is a runner. It's just idle chatter. Unilever just does not want to go down the beer route or the packaging route and it does not want to hold a raft of businesses in France, Italy and Spain,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
A more likely target for Unilever is CPC International, said analysts, the company has a large, fast moving, international consumer foods and baking business and some 60 percent of its sales outside the United States. CPC brands include Hellmann's Mayonnaise and Knor soups, Pot Noodles and Skippy peanut butter.
Unilever chairman Niall Fitzgerald said at the time of the company's full year results earlier this month he hopes to conclude a sale in the next three to six months. He also said the sale was designed to ""de-clutter"" the group's portfolio and concentrate on key brands which include Persil detergent, Solero and Magnum ice-cream and Flora margarine as well as free up funds for expansion in emerging markets like South America and Asia Pacific.
The European foods business remains depressed against a weak economic background, poor consumer demand and tough competition.
""I don't think Danone has got enough eastern promise about it,"" said Michael Landymore analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. ""It would put Unilever squarely back in Europe which it has said it trying to get out of in favour of developing markets,"" said Campbell.
Unilever would also have to break up Danone to get its hands on the right business lines -- grocery, biscuits and water, said analysts.
""Unilever would have to break the company up because it would not want to keep the glass containers division or the beer division,"" said Campbell. ""It's also a flagship food company in France and it would be investigated under anti-trust legislation by the EC (European Commission),"" he added.
The EU has to clear a merger or acquisition involving a world-wide turnover of at least five billion ECU and a European turnover threshold of 250 million ECUs.
Acquiring Danone would also stretch Unilever's resources, said analysts, who estimate the company has a warchest of about 10 billion stg after the sale of its speciality chemicals division. Danone, capitalised at about $10.8 billion, would probably fetch a price of about $15 billion, said analysts.

TimFarrand,"British oil and exploration company LASMO Plc on Thursday reported profits nearly doubled in 1996 was confident about the prospects for oil prices and group oil production in 1997.
LASMO reported after-tax profits of 67 million pounds ($109 million), up from 34 million pounds. It declared a dividend of 2.0p, up from 1.25p.
The figures were in line with broker forecasts of 64 to 75 million pounds, and the shares were up 4-1/2p at 243-1/2p just before the last hour of trading in London.

""We are planning on $19 average for the year on Brent.""
The company benefited from the unexpected strength of oil prices in 1996 and tighter control over costs. Average oil prices rose to $18.72 from $17.09 in 1995.
LASMO reported operating costs of 2.87 pounds on average per barrel produced, down from 3.17 pounds in 1995 but still above its main rival Enterprise Oil.
Darby said LASMO expected to reduce costs further in 1997, although ""we are getting to the point where progress will be slower."" Just three years ago its costs were at four pounds, well above the industry average.

TimFarrand,"London Clubs International, which runs the London Ritz and Les Ambassadeurs casinos, defended its hostile 181 million pound ($292.1 million) bid for Capital Corporation on Tuesday, describing it as ""generous"" and ""appropriate"".
""I think we have said it is a generous offer. There clearly maybe circumstances in which we would be prepared to reconsider our position but at this stage we clearly think we are coming forward with an appropriate offer,"" said LCI chief executive Alan Goodenough in an interview.
But takeover target Capital Corporation hit back swiftly, saying the offer from London Clubs failed to take account of its potential.
""As we have said already this offer takes no account of our potential now that we have two fully operational high roller clubs,"" said Capital Corp chief executive Alan Hearn in a statement.
""Given our experience of the business, we think we are in the best position to value it and on that basis we think it is a generous offer,"" said Goodenough.
""At this stage what we have got on the table is what we consider to be appropriate given the information that we have,"" he said.
He would not be drawn on how Capital Corp shareholders are responding to the offer. The decision rests with about just six institutions who own more than 50 percent of both companies.
Mercury Asset Management owns about 18 percent of shares in both companies, PDFM has some nine percent of Capital Corp and three percent of London Clubs, Schroders has nine percent in London Clubs and 3.5 percent in Capital.
Jupiter has some six percent in London Clubs and 10 percent in Capital. Morgan Grenfell Fund Managers owns about four percent in London Clubs and 12 percent in Capital.
""We have visited them (institutional shareholders) and presented our case and I would be very disappointed if they did not see the logic of what we are telling them,"" said Goodenough.
London Clubs unveiled its offer document for Capital Corp on Tuesday in which it set out its rationale for the bid, saying Capital has failed to deliver shareholder value.
London Clubs also argues that it has casinos overseas, whereas Capital Corp has only two London ones, which reduces volatility of earnings.
It also said it has an international profile that will lead to further expansion opportunities.
London Clubs International shares closed two pence up at 384-1/2p. Capital Corp shares were flat at 203p.

TimFarrand,"Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc spelled out a more conciliatory approach to a string of U.S. tobacco-related lawsuits on Wednesday, saying it was now time to explore settling the claims.
""The on-going cost in legal terms, and the impact on the share price is such that we think it sensible and appropriate to evaluate a settlement,"" B.A.T chief executive Martin Broughton said.
He put the legal costs at $100 million in 1996, which he expected to rise at least over the next two years.
A sensible settlement would be one that covered all current and future claims and was approved by Congress and the White House, he said.
There have been press reports that a congressionally sanctioned settlement might be in the works under which tobacco companies would settle claims with U.S. states which have filed suits, in response for immunity.
A commentary published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday, however, argued that the states were better off seeking compensation from the companies rather than letting Congress broker a deal.
B.A.T has spent an estimated 250 million pounds ($402.9 million) in legal costs fighting tobacco-related law suits.
Since the first case was filed in 1954, about 500 cases have been filed although only 19 have reached trial across the industry. There was a big increase in cases filed in 1996, although there are only isolated cases outside the U.S.
""I can't see the legal costs coming down, the trend is for it to continue upwards,"" Broughton said.
Last week, a federal judge in the United States dismissed a lawsuit filed by the City and County of San Francisco and 10 other California counties against the tobacco industry.
The tobacco industry hailed the ruling as a victory in its fight against lawsuits seeking to force cigarette companies to repay states and municipalities for health care costs of smokers. It is believed to be the first ruling to totally dismiss a lawsuit of this type.
Although anti-smoking lawyers said the ruling was a drawback, they remained optimistic about the more than 20 other cases pending around the country.
So far the company has not been approached by plaintiffs or the U.S. government with any sensible proposals, said Broughton.
""There ought to be a sensible figure which gets it sorted out,"" said Broughton.
Sums of $10 billion and $6 billion -- which represent the profits of the entire U.S. tobacco industry -- have been suggested by plaintiffs as the cost of settlement for the industry.
These sorts of figures are clearly unacceptable, said Broughton, especially in view of the fact that the company is confident it will win the pending cases.
Of the 19 cases to reach the courts the tobacco industry has won all except one which is currently under appeal.
In the last few weeks a federal judge in San Francisco dismissed a lawsuit filed by the City and County of San Franciso and 10 other California counties against the tobacco industry.
San Francisco and other counties are among a growing number of municipalities and states that have sued the tobacco industry to recoup Medicaid costs.
The attorneys general from 22 states have filed such suits. The first of the trials, which stems from a case bought by Mississipi is scheduled for June.
On February 18 a West Virginia county circuit judge dismissed all of the state's claims for fraud, negligence, unjust enrichment and conspircay against 17 tobacco companies, saying the attorney general lacked authority to pursue the claim.
A case against R.J. Reynolds, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, is due to be heard in April.
A judgement on whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has the right to regulate cigarette sales and marketing is expected in the next six weeks.
If the FDA wins its rules would ban free samples and billboard ads near schools and playgrounds, limit vending machine sales, ban sponsorship of sports events and the use of cigarette brands on hats, t-shirts and other products.
The rules would also restrict advertising in some publications and require retailers to see photo identifications for cigarette buyers under the age of 27.

TimFarrand,"Tobacco to insurance group B.A.T Industries Plc on Wednesday posted a five percent rise in 1996 profits and signalled it would look at settling anti-tobacco lawsuits in the United States.
It also said it would take a closer look at its own corporate structure. The company said it was keeping an open mind about whether to demerge its tobacco and insurance arms but added it was interested in buying a British life insurer.
Profits before tax rose to 2.495 billion pounds ($4 billion) but were hit by a 160 million charge for U.S. environmental claims against its Eagle Star insurance unit. Excluding the charge, profit rose by seven percent, putting them at the lower end of stock market forecasts.
Chief executive Martin Broughton told reporters that while the company maintained its stance that it had no liability, it now considered it sensible to look at settling U.S. tobacco claims in the context of agreement with Congress.
""The on-going cost in legal terms, and the impact on the share price is such that we think it sensible and appropriate to evaluate a settlement,"" he said.
He put the legal costs at $100 million in 1996, which he expected to rise at least for the next two years.

He said the company remained confident it would ultimately win any cases against it.
B.A.T estimates it has spent 250 million pounds ($402.9 million) in legal costs fighting tobacco-related law suits.
About 500 cases have been filed since 1954, but only 19 have so far reached the courts across the industry.
As well as disappointment over the exceptional insurance charge some analysts had hoped B.A.T would say more about the possible demerger of its tobacco and insurance arms.
B.A.T shares, up 32 percent since November on promising perceptions about its legal battles in the U.S., tumbled 20 pence to close at 530 pence on Wednesday.
Chairman Lord Cairns told reporters the company kept an open mind on its corporate structure.
""We are not wedded to the structure that we have at the moment. It is a question over which we keep an open mind.""
B.A.T's tobacco business turned in a seven percent overall improvement in local currency to 1.634 billion pounds with group volumes four percent ahead and world market share increasing to 12.8 percent from 12.4 percent.

The company has looked at several options for improving shareholder return over the last year, including merging its financial services arm, comprising mainly general and life insurance companies, with another insurer.
Prideaux dismissed the idea of floating off the company's U.S. cigarette arm Brown &amp; Williamson as a way of ringfencing the rest of B.A.T from any potential payments to smokers in the United States.

TimFarrand,"Britain's largest brewer Scottish and Newcastle is prepared to stick with its Center Parcs holiday resorts through both good times and bad, chief executive Brian Stewart said.
""We do see leisure as offering very significant growth oppurtunities, we have to take the rough with the smooth and we have a period which is difficult but we will overcome that,"" he told Reuters late on Tuesday.
Profits from Center Parcs resorts were down 11 percent at 39 million pounds at the half-year stage due to weak economic conditions in mainland Europe and the cost of improving its facilities in the Netherlands.
The relatively poor performance of S&amp;N's leisure division has caused many analysts to question the wisdom of S&amp;N's move into leisure.
""We certainly hope the consumer gains a little bit of confidence in Europe but we are very positive about initiatives we are taking now to get Center Parcs back on track.""
Bookings in UK Center Parcs were ""very strong and well ahead of last year,"" said Stewart.
He said the planned opening of Rank -owned village holiday resort Oasis was no more serious a competitive a threat than any other leisure deveopment.
He said the company planned to concentrate on existing Center Parcs and no new Center Parcs would be built in the next year.
""We are very positive about our future prospects from our leisure division, where we see significant growth oppurtunities,"" said Stewart, adding that he expected to see some improvement in mainland Europe from Center Parcs in 1998.
""Whether the consumer recovers in terms of confidence, especially in Germany, I think is debatable because there will be political and economic uncertainty there this calendar year.""
He said S&amp;N was unconcerned that it had lost some market share to Bass BASS.l in the beer market.
""I'm not worried about the competition, I'm worried that our brands continue to perform as well as they have done over the past twelve months.""
""Our brands are performing better and people are more conscious about brands, consumer service and marketing support, so I see the recipe pretty much as we have experienced over the last 12 months.""
Stewart said S&amp;N expected to continue to supply beer to most of Inntrepeneur's 3,000 tied pubs, despite the fact its exclusive beer supply contract with the company expires in March 1998.
Pub company Inntrepreneur is jointly owned by Grand Metropolitan and Australian brewer Foster's.
""We do anticipate we will hold the majority of the brands based on our brand performance through those outlets. You have got to remember that publicans have traded with these brands for many years and they will not wish to upset their customers, particularly when the brands are performing as well as they are.""

TimFarrand,"British betting and Hilton hotel company Ladbroke Group Plc on Thursday posted a 34 percent increase in 1996 pretax profits to 163 million pounds ($263 million) before exceptional items and forecast further good progress during 1997.
Chief executive Peter George also made positive remarks about trading since its 1996 year ended on December 31.
""The same trend has continued in the last two months. The businesses are doing well. It does seem to be getting gradually better this year in mainland Europe,"" George said in an interview. Trading profits from its European hotels fell slightly in 1996.
""In Germany we have seen a few patchy signs of improvement. A few of our properties have actually done better in the first couple of months this year than last year but I would not say that augurs for a recovery this year.""
""I think it will take up to another 12 months for Germany to come back.""
Revenue per available room (RevPar) in hotels in mainland Europe fell to 50.8 pounds in 1996 from 52.1 pounds. In London it rose to 70.4 pounds from 60.4 and to 37.9 pounds from 33.2 pounds elsewhere in Britain.
""Japan is still tough I must say, Tokyo and particularly for us Osaka where new properties have been opened,"" George said.
Overall hotel occupancy levels rose slightly to 69.6 percent from 69 percent and group RevPar moved from 48 pounds to 49.3 pounds.
Ladbroke shares put on 10p to reach 235p in morning trade as the company's headline profit figure pipped the consensus forecast from brokers of 160 million pounds.
""The results were a little better than our expectations at both the pretax and the earnings per share level,"" said Nigel Reed, industry analyst at Paribas Capital Markets. Earnings per share before exceptional items were up 40 percent to 10.44 pence during the period.
Hilton International, which operates Hilton hotels outside the United States, increased trading profits by an underlying 20 percent to 160.2 million, and the betting and gaming division grew profits by 46 percent to 84.9 million.
Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp agreed to reunite the Hilton hotels brand worldwide for the first time in 32 years in January. Previously HHC had the rights to the Hilton name in the United States and Ladbroke owned them elsewhere.
""Betting was much better than we thought and hotels were slightly under what we thought they could do,"" Reed said.
Ladbroke's retail betting business in Britain showed a marked recovery despite the 8.0 million pound cost associated with jockey Frankie Dettori's unique feat of winning all seven races at an Ascot race meeting last September.
On the casino side, the only disappointment was London's Maxims club, where George said there had been a reduction in high stake gambling and the company had made provisions for outstanding debt.
But a weaker performance from Ladbroke's casino division was more than offset by earnings in retail betting where trading profit rose to 59.8 million in 1996 from 34.1 million.
George said the company, which has decided to close down its property division, was still trying to dispose of two properties in the United States and one in Israel which should make a total gain of about 70 million pounds.
Net debt fell by 315.6 million to 707.7 million, reducing the interest charge by 25.8 million to 70.3 million. At its peak three years ago the company was crippled by debt of 1.6 billion pounds during a deep recession in the property market.
Exceptional items amounted to 103.8 million pounds included 52.3 million arising from the group's exit from commercial property and 15.4 million for the adjustment to the price of DIY retailer Texas Homecare sold to J. Sainsbury two years ago.

TimFarrand,"British food manufacturer Hillsdown Holdings plc on Thursday reported a 10.5 percent increase in its 1996 pretax profits to 150.5 million pounds ($242.7 million) and said the business climate in 1997 looked good.
""The year has only just begun for Hillsdown but the business climate in 1997 looks favourable,"" Chairman Sir John Nott said.
The scare over mad cow disease -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- continued to dent Hillsdown's meat business but it helped lift its poultry and fish sales.
Trading profit on canning, preserves, biscuits and drinks rose to 63.6 million pounds in 1996 from 40.5 million, although earnings from chilled foods were flat at 21.2 million.
Profits from the company's meat and produce division fell to 9.1 million from 12.4 million in 1995 but the poultry, furniture and housebuilding division boosted profits from 36.2 million to 46.8 million.
Earnings from Britain rose by some 35 million to 146.5 million but in mainland Europe trading profits were flat at about 30 million, reflecting the poor state of the German economy.
""The red meat market has continued to be lifeless and our international meat traders, Towers, have effectively had to tread water with the emphasis on tight stock control,"" said chief executive George Greener in a statement.
Fairview New Homes, which had a strong second half and has doubled its land bank over the last two years, is set for strong profits performance as confidence in the housing recovery grows, he said.
Greener scotched some hopes in financial markets that the group would dispose of its non-food interests.
He said the structure and culture of Hillsdown as a diversified manufacturing company is a major strength and should be enhanced.
""I do not believe it is simply a question of divesting of highly profitable non-food businesses,"" said Greener.

TimFarrand,"British household products group Reckitt and Colman Plc is expected to report a 15 percent increase in its full year profits on Thursday, as the benefits of its acquisition of L&amp;F Products feeds through.
Analysts forecasts for 1996 pretax profits range from 314 to 320 million stg, up from 285 million last time. Estimates of the total dividend range from 21.8 to 22.6 pence.
The group, known for brands ranging from Mr Sheen polish and Brasso, to Dettol disinfectant, acquired L&amp;F Products, maker of America's best-selling disinfectant Lysol, for one billion pounds in 1994.
""The real driver will come from the benefits of intergrating L&amp;F, which will bring substantial cost-savings,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
At the half year stage, the company reported sales up 5.3 percent, although turnover in the United States grew more strongly at 7.0 percent. In Europe underlying sales were flat due to sluggish economic activity and stiffer competition.
""It's primarily from the U.S., where we expect growth. We have had encouraging signs from management in the last couple of months on that one,"" said an analyst.
At the half year stage, pretax profits grew to 165 million stg from 149.6 million. Turnover from continuing operations grew by just four percent during the period to 1.16 billion stg.
The company continues to face competition in Britain and mainland Europe from larger retail chains selling cheaper own-brand products.
Reckitt has targetted South America and Asia, where it believes consumers are more influenced by brand names. Last year sales in eastern Asia rose by 25 percent, while in Brazil turnover jumped 20 percent.
The company generates about 32 percent of revenue from Europe, a similar amount from North America and 18 percent from emerging markets.
Reckitt shares have risen sharply in recent weeks amid market rumout that it may fall victim to a takeover bid by Unilever.
But the investment community has now largely dismissed this, arguing that it does not fit the fast moving consumer goods sector that Unilever Plc has identified as one of its favourites, nor does it have enough of a presence in emerging markets.
The shares have risen more than a pound since the rumours emerged, to the current 805p level and many analysts think this sort of bid premium now makes it too expensive as a takeover candidate.
""Our view is that on balance Unilever probably have higher targets on their list as in some ways Reckitt replicates Unilever in terms of its geographic exposure and I think Unielver wants to expand more rapidly in emerging markets,"" said Carl Short, analyst at SocGen.
R&amp;C's stated aim is to become the world leader in household products and dominate over the counter pharmaceuticals.
The company's whose name used to be synonomous with Britain's favourite mustard Coleman's now generates only about five percent of its trading profit from food operations.

Underlying profits growth was in line with stock brokers forecasts, but a presentation by management to analysts was greeted positively, sending the group's shares up 11 pence to 248-1/2p by 1415 gmt.
""It's all quite encouraging. The way they are analysing and managing the business is very much more in line with what the market demands,"" said Richard Workman, an analyst at ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett.
The company said its recovery was strongly led by its British operations, while in mainland Europe, it started to realise the potential of businesses acquired earlier in the 1990's.
UB's British business increased profits before exceptional items by 12 percent to 113.7 million pounds as renewed consumer confidence encouraged shoppers to step up brands.
In an interview UB's managing director Eric Nicoli said UB Has now entered a phase of consolidation after a hectic disposal programme.
""The emphasis is on organic growth as we are now in a consolidation phase,"" said Nicoli.
Over the last two years UB has sold its American snack operation Keebler, pulled out of Portugal and exited from Spanish snacks. It has also sold one of its Italian snack businesses, withdrawn from Turkey and Brazil and sold Ross Vegetables Products business in Britain.
UB expects its margins in Europe to remain firm and to move up over the next two to three years, said Nicoli.
""We expect margins to move to 10 percent in all our businesses over a two or three year period,"" he said.
(Corrects to make clear that company isn't expecting European markets alone to move by 10 percent.)
UB margins are currently at around 10 percent in Britain and four percent in mainland Europe.
In 1997 the company plans to build on the turnaround ""all our markets continue to be very competitive but we expect another year of good progress,"" said Nicoli.
The total dividend payout was increased by 10 pence per share from 9.8p.
The company's leading biscuit brands include McVities in Britain, Verkade in Holland and Oxford in Denmark. Biscuit sales growth came from the launch of Go Ahead! a range of low fat products. UB also owns snacks KP Nuts, Skips and Hula Hoops.

(Corrects to make clear company isn't expecting European margins alone to move by 10 percent over the next two to three years.)
Earlier the company reported a more than doubling in pretax, pre-exceptional annual profits to 109.1 million stg. UB shares were 7-1/2p higher at 246p in early trade.  
UB has now entered a phase of consolidation, after a hectic disposal programme, which means the emphasis is on organic growth, said Nicoli.
Over the last two years the company has sold its American snack operation Keebler, pulled out of Portugal and exited from Spanish snacks. It has also sold one of its Italian snack businesses, withdrawn from Turkey and Brazil and sold Ross Vegetables Products business in Britain.  
""The emphasis on organic growth as we are now in a consolidation phase,"" said Nicoli.
When asked about the outlook for the company he said, ""Our markets continue to be very competitive but we expect another year of good progress.""
In Britain, there is a trend among shoppers to switch into higher value lines against a background of improved consumer confidence, said Nicoli.
In mainland Europe, he said the company's businesses will improve but it did not expect any help from the markets.

TimFarrand,"British household products group Reckitt and Colman Plc reported an 11 percent rise in 1996 pretax profits to 316.5 million pounds ($505.5 million) on Thursday, saying the underlying performance of the group remained solid.
In an interview, chief executive Vernon Sankey said the group expected to see similar growth rates in sales and earnings in 1997.
But the company's shares slipped 3p to 782p as the figures came in right in the middle of brokers' forecast range.
Household products, comprising 80 percent of group turnover, posted a nine percent increase in trading profit to 283.9 million. Earnings from the pharmaceutical division grew 12.2 percent to 67.2 million.
The company benefitted from 27 million of savings from its integration of L&amp;F Products in North America, which it acquired for one billion pounds in 1994. Lysol, America's best selling disinfectant, increased its market share across the range.
The lavatory care category grew by 18.1 percent in Africa and the Middle East, and most of the countries in Latin America showed double digit growth with Harpic. Floor care products in Latin America achieved record sales, driving the group's regional market share up to 49.5 percent.
But economic conditions in Europe continued to be tough and sales overall were flat although margins improved, said the company.
""Mainland Europe has been relatively flat for most of 1996 and I think it's too early to say Europe is turning around. There are some reasonable signs. France and germany are still very tough,"" said Sankey.
The strategy is working, he said, which remains to focus on number one and number two brands with global potential, use the group's wide geographic base and expand in developing markets.
About one third of Reckitt's business comes from North America, one third in Europe, a third from the the rest of the world. Some 26 percent of business comes from developing markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America.
If sterling remains at its current high levels on foreign exchange markets it would hit Reckitt by some 20 million on translation next year, Sankey said.
Reckitt shares have risen by 14 percent in recent weeks amid market rumours that the company may fall victim to a takeover bid by Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever.
But many analysts now think the bid premium makes the company too expensive as a takeover target.
Sankey dismissed speculation that Unilever Plc would bid for Reckitt as just rumour, saying the company has not been approached by Unilever.
""It's a rumour and we have had rumours for years. We get rumours everyday, now quite frankly that is it,"" said Sankey.
The company declared a total dividend payout of 21.97 pence per share up from 20.15 pence. Including the foreign income dividend it was increased to 23.37p.

ToddNissen,"Federal-Mogul Corp., dropping its four-year effort to build a global auto parts retail empire, unveiled a massive restructuring Thursday that returns it to its core manufacturing and distribution business.
The Southfield, Mich.-based company said it took a total of $264 million in pre-tax charges to cover the restructuring and special one-time items from the fourth quarter.
Federal-Mogul, which has about $2 billion in annual sales, also said it will slash about 2,900 jobs, equal to 18.5 percent of its worldwide work force of 15,700.
The charges resulted in a net loss of $220.2 million for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $49.1 million for the 1995 period.
For all of 1996, the company lost $211.1 million, but would have posted a profit of $34.7 million before special items. In 1995 the company lost $9.7 million.
""We have realigned our growth strategy behind our core competencies of engineering, manufacturing and distribution,"" Chairman Dick Snell said in a statement. ""Our retail operations are good viable businesses that can be operated better by someone else.""
The company makes a wide variety of products, ranging from engine bearings, oil seals and pistons to lighting and electrical components, for the auto, farm and construction vehicle industry.
Federal Mogul stock closed up 87.5 cents at $24.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Snell, the former CEO of Tenneco Inc.'s automotive business, joined Federal-Mogul in early November. He earned high praise from analysts Thursday for his swift action and straightforward explantion of where the company is headed.
""This is the kind of stock where if the numbers work out, the stock is going to work out, because people want to like him,"" said Salomon Brothers analyst Darren Kimball.
Nicholas Colas, an analyst at CS First Boston, said the restructuring makes sense because the firm tried to expand in an area where it had no in-house retail expertise.
""Basically, the grand vision of having an international third world distribution and retail business is gone,"" he said. ""This is much more playing to the company's historical strengths.""
Included in the restructuring is the planned sale of 132 international retail operations in Australia, Chile, Ecuador, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and Venezuela, and the planned sale or restructuring of about 30 wholesale operations in 10 countries.
The firm also plans to relocate product lines in its European manufacturing operations and cut the work force; consolidate lighting products in Juarez, Mexico; and close a manufacturing facility in Indiana. The company also plans to close two distribution warehouses in Kentucky, consolidate customer support functions in the United States and streamline administration and operational staff functions worldwide.
The moves are a complete reversal of the efforts by former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Gormley, who was forced to resign in September after pressure from the board.
Snell said in an interview that future restructuring in North America and Europe are likely, which could result in more job losses over the next few years, although not on the scale of Thursday's announcement.
At the same time, the firm will be on the lookout for acquisitions that could add to its core businesses, he said. For instance, since Federal-Mogul makes engine bearings, it makes sense for it also to offer pistons, Snell said.

ToddNissen,"Federal-Mogul Corp unveiled a massive restructuring Thursday that dumps its four-year effort to build a global auto parts retail empire and returns the firm to its core manufacturing and distribution business.
The Southfield, Mich.-based auto supply firm said it will take a total of $264 million in pre-tax charges to cover the restructuring and special one-time items from the fourth quarter. Investors approved of the action, pushing the stock up $1.50 to $25 a share.  
Nicholas Colas, an analyst at CS First Boston, said the move is a prudent one for the company, which had no in-house retail expertise when it began to expand in that area.
""Basically, the grand vision of having an international third world distribution and retail business is gone,"" he said. ""This is much more playing to the company's historical strengths.""
The moves mark a reversal of the efforts by former chairman and chief executive officer Dennis Gormley, who was forced to resign in September after pressure from the board.  
Gormley spent about $500 million on acquisitions since 1992, although a company spokeswoman said less than one-third of that was related to the international retail expansion.
""Our retail operations are good viable businesses that can be operated better by someone else,"" said Federal-Mogul Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dick Snell, who announced the restructuring 95 days after he assumed the company's top post.  
Snell was formerly the CEO of Tenneco Inc's automotive unit. He said in a statement there will be further restructuring that will generate positive cash flow, adding the company expects a ""positive economic value added"" by 1998.
Colas said future restructuring charges will range from $5 million to $7 million in the next couple of years. He said Snell told analysts Federal-Mogul has a goal of nine to 10 percent return on capital by the end of 1997, and 12 percent by the end of 1998.
""The guiding light at this company has shifted from trying to create earnings growth to creating shareholder value,"" said Colas.
Federal-Mogul, which had $2.03 billion in 1996 sales, also said it will slash about 2,900 jobs, equal to 18.5 percent of its worldwide workforce of 15,700. The charges resulted in a net loss of $220.2 million for the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $49.1 million for the 1995 period.

ToddNissen,"It is probably a good thing the National Automobile Dealers Association annual convention will not be returning any time soon to Atlanta, where the CarMax superstore has made a big splash.
Acting on a request from CarMax management, a local policeman forced three reporters out of the CarMax lot in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross, telling them people associated with the convention were banned from the store.
A momentary lapse of Southern hospitality? Hardly. The incident ranks as only one more illustration of the friction, fear and outright hostility caused by the new breed of used car superstores and mega dealers.
Although the superstores now account for only a fraction of the 40.8 million used cars sold in 1996, H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries Inc. is on a relentless campaign to buy new vehicle dealerships.
Republic, which owns the AutoNation USA chain, added two more dealer groups this week, lifting estimated 1997 revenues to more than $2.8 billion, the single largest in the country.
Together, the CarMax and Republic models are taking the industry by storm, and in the process are tearing apart a system traditional franchised dealers have known for 80 years.
CarMax in particular drew a steady stream of criticism from many dealers -- and some manufacturers -- at the convention, which wrapped up earlier this week.
Yale Gieszl, the top Toyota Motor Corp. executive in the United States, blasted CarMax during a press conference, saying Toyota would not grant a new car franchise to the company.
""I don't think size is equivalent to customer service,"" said Gieszl, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc.
Officials at CarMax returned the favour by turning down all requests for tours of the Norcross store. The outlet is unique because it is the only CarMax to have a new car franchise, from Chrysler Corp., which was granted last year.
Morgan Stewart, a spokesman for Circuit City Stores Inc., which owns 80 percent of CarMax, said there were simply too many requests to accommodate the visitors.
""We had hundreds if not thousands of people showing up, looking for tours, and we had to keep our primary commitment, which was to serve customers,"" he said.
As for the reporters, Stewart said they should have first contacted Circuit City's public relations department at the company's Richmond, Va., headquarters.
Although the superstores have received much attention for emphasising a more friendly sales approach, many dealers remain unconvinced they can successfuly run the business side.
Vinje Dahl, who owns Dahl Ford in Davenport, Iowa, said it is not easy to operate used car businesses profitably on a local level, where an intimate knowledge of the market is key. Profit margins are razor-thin, and a dealership is considered doing well if its return on sales is 1.5 percent to 2 percent.
""We're in a buying business, we aren't really in a selling business,"" he said, adding, ""I don't think these guys are buying very smart.""
For now, CarMax sales are booming. For January sales from stores open at least a year were up 33 percent, while total sales rose 90 percent to $43.1 million, thanks to the addition of two new superstores.
CarMax, however, is not expected to report significant profits before 1999, said Nicholas Colas, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
Despite their grousing, many of the dealers privately expressed envy and amazement at the prices Republic is paying. Profitable dealerships typically sell for three to five times earnings, dealers said, but Republic is paying for dealer groups in stock that value the deals at 17 to 20 times earnings.
Colas said the fact the deals are for stock and not cash does carry some risk for those selling because their wealth is dependent on future growth and stock market valuation. But the pay-off could be big if they execute well.
Still, car dealers, a notoriously independent bunch, may be in for a rude shock if they sell out to companies whose stock is scrutinised by Wall Street.
""I don't think most dealers are cognizant of how quickly the world is changing around them, and how brutal public ownership is,"" said Colas.

ToddNissen,"Federal-Mogul Corp hopes to pay off $185 million in debt in 1997, bringing its total debt to capital ratio to under 60 percent by the end of the year, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dick Snell said Thursday.
Snell told Reuters in an interview other goals for 1997 include hitting a return on invested capital of 12 percent, although the year's average will probably be below that.
Over the last three years, Federal-Mogul has been earning from 4.5 percent to six percent on its capital -- below its cost of capital of 12 percent.  
During 1998, Snell would like the company to be earning a 10 percent return on sales. ""Those are goals,"" he said. ""I think we have a reasonable chance of making it, but I'm not promising.""
The Southfield, Mich.-based auto parts supplier announced a broad restructuring Thursday that will take it out of the international retail business. The restructuring and other one-time items resulted in a $264 million pre-tax charge.
Federal-Mogul reduced its debt by $104 million in 1996. Debt-to-capital is 69 percent, although Snell said that will fall as the company sells off its retail operations.  
Snell said the company has been in contact with possible buyers of the retail operations. A single buyer for the whole package is unlikely, he said, noting the business could be sold in three to 10 different pieces. The firm paid a total of about $125 million for the retail operations.
""We're not going to give away the shareholders' assets,"" he said. ""We're going to demand a good value for them.""
Snell said further consolidations of its North American distribution system and European operations are likely on top of those already announced. Those will likely result in more headcount reductions over in the next few years.  
Federal-Mogul plans to add a new position of vice president of marketing to improve customer relations, Snell said. Finalsts have been selected for the job, which will also be responsible for shoring up the firm's after-market brands.
""We have some very, very good well known aftermarket brands that haven't had much of any in the way of market support the past several years, which I think is sort of the hidden opportunity this company has,"" he said.
As it digests the restructuring, Federal-Mogul will also be on the lookout for acquisitions that add to its core manufacturing businesses, said Snell. For instance, since the firm makes engine bearings, it makes sense for it to also offer pistons, he said.
Snell did not rule out the possibilty of an acquisition worth ""several hundred million"" in 1997 if the right opportunity arises.
Salomon Brothers analyst Darren Kimball said Snell, who has been on the job 95 days, impressed investors and analysts with the moves announced Thursday.
""This is the kind of stock where if the numbers work out, the stock is going to work out because people want to like him,"" he said.

ToddNissen,"Talks aimed at settling a dispute between the United Auto Workers and Johnson Controls Inc. continued Thursday afternoon, as Ford Motor Co. prepared to idle light truck production lines at three plants.
Johnson Controls spokesman Jeff Steiner said in a recorded message that talks were continuing as of mid-afternoon to resolve the strike, which entered its 10th day Thursday.
About 500 UAW workers walked off the job Jan. 28 at two Johnson Controls seat plants in Plymouth, Mich., and Oberlin, Ohio, after talks on a new contract collapsed.
The plants conduct final seat assembly for the Ford Expedition full-size sport utility, and Econoline and Club Wagons full-size vans.
With no sign that a settlement is near, Ford is sticking with plans to idle all of its Michigan Truck Assembly plant, and part of two other facilities in Ohio, said Ford spokesman Bert Serre.
On Wednesday, Ford said it would suspend production at the plants if the two sides did not resolve their issues, a move that would idle about 6,800 hourly workers.
Ford has refused to accept seats made by non-union labour, but has continued to make and store Expeditions and Econolines, using temporary seats to finish production.
When production of the current shifts concludes, Ford will have made 7,700 Expeditions and 7,100 full-size vans without regular seats, Serre said. He declined to comment on the how much the shutdown would cost the automaker.
Analysts have said Ford earns $10,000 in pre-tax profits on the Expedition, one of its most popular and profitable vehicles. Normally, Ford makes 42 Expeditions an hour, or 840 vehicles a day during two 10-hour shifts at Michigan Truck.
Because Ford makes its F-Series pickup trucks on the same line as the Expedition, the company said stopping Expedition production will also force it to halt F-Series assembly.
Ohio plants affected are the van assembly line in Lorain, and a frame production line at Ford's Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake.
Taking cues from Ford, Johnson Controls did not stand in the way of UAW organising efforts at the plants last fall. The UAW has been stepping up efforts to organise auto suppliers to boost its falling membership base.
The union says it wants seat workers at the two plants to receive pay levels competitive with other seat manufacturers. But Johnson Controls maintains its offer is competitive with what the UAW has accepted elsewhere.
"
ToddNissen,"Ford Motor Co. halted light truck assembly lines at three plants Friday as planned because of a strike at a seat supplier, but signed up another company to help it clear out the backlog of 7,700 Expeditions built without proper seats.
Following an appeal from Ford Chairman Alex Trotman, Lear Corp. Chairman Kenneth Way agreed to have his company make seats for Ford's Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle once the walkout is settled, according to sources in the supply industry.
Under the arrangement, Lear, which already is a large Ford supplier, would make second and third row seats for the Expedition, said Donna Parolini, president of International Business Development Corp., a consulting firm in Troy, Mich.
Front seats for the vehicles are being made by Ford's Chesterfield, Mich., trim plant, Ford officials have said. Ford spokesman Bert Serre said the plant has been making a limited number of seats, less than 20 an hour.
Ford suspended all production at its Michigan Assembly in Wayne, which makes the Expedition and F-Series pickup trucks, after the United Auto Workers and Johnson Controls Inc. failed to settle a strike, which entered its 11th day Friday.
Ohio plants affected were the Econoline and Club Wagon full-size van assembly line in Lorain and a frame production line at Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake. About 6,800 workers were idled as a result of the action.
Industry analysts said the strike has Ford in a huge bind. The Expedition is one of its most profitable and popular vehicles, earning Ford an estimated pre-tax profit of $10,000 each. Under normal production, it makes 840 vehicles at day Michigan Truck, the only plant where the Expedition is made.
But to avoid angering its own UAW workers, Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacement workers. It had been making the vehicles with temporary seats. But after making about 14,800 Expeditions and Econolines without proper seats, Ford decided to shut production down completely.
""To interrupt Expedition production for any extended period of time would hurt Ford financially in North America,"" said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich.
Because Ford and Lear do not want to provoke the UAW, Lear, which has unionized plants, would not start producing seats until the strike is over, said Parolini. Another issue prohibiting Lear from making seats immediately is the fact that it buys seat frames from the same Johnson Controls facility that assembles seats for Ford.
Shutting down Expedition production means an extension of the three- to six-month wait that many consumers already face. Introduced last fall, the Expedition has been a huge hit with buyers looking for a sleek, larger sport utility.
""The reception of this vehicle has been the highest of anything I've seen since the original Mustang,"" said Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the largest Ford dealers in the country.
About 500 UAW members struck Johnson Controls seat plants January 28 in Plymouth, Mich., and Oberlin, Ohio, when talks broke down on a new contract.
Jeff Steiner, a spokesman for Johnson Controls' automotive unit, said no talks occurred Friday after they broke off late Thursday. No new negotiations were scheduled for the weekend.
Steiner declined to characterize the discussions, which have restarted and collapsed several times since the strike began over terms for a new contract.
"
ToddNissen,"Convinced there is no quick end in sight to a crippling seat supplier strike, Ford Motor Co. said Monday it was moving ahead with a plan to resume production of its Expedition full-size sport utilty vehicle with seats from another company.
Ford hopes to finalize its restart efforts by the middle or end of this week, said spokesman Bert Serre. Lear Corp., the substitute seat supplier, plans to start making the seats later this week.
The automaker halted production of the Expedition and Econoline and Club Wagon full-size vans early Friday afternoon, idling 6,800 workers in Michigan and Ohio.
Ford had hoped a 14-day strike by about 500 United Auto Workers union members at two Johnson Controls Inc. seat plants would be settled. In deference to its own union workforce, Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacements.
Ford, however, made 7,700 Expeditions and 7,100 Econolines without seats, before it ran out of storage room and grew concerned over Johnson Controls' ability to meet the backlog and regular production demand. Over the weekend, Ford made its own labor negtiators available to help resolve the dispute.
""From our position, we're disappointed that Johnson Controls and the UAW haven't been able to reach a settlement. We've done everything we could,"" said Serre. ""Now, we've made the decision to act.""
The seat agreement with Lear is a temporary one, company officials said. Lear spokeswoman Leslie Touma would not disclose what Detroit area plant will make the seats. Touma also declined to comment on what reaction Lear's unionized workers might have to the company's decision.
""Ford is a valued Lear customer, and we're trying to help them out during this time,"" she said.
Ford will first focus on putting seats in new Expeditions built once production resumes, said Serre. It will then turn its attention to the backlog of Expeditions built without seats. The Expedition is one of Ford's most profitable vehicles, generating an estimated $10,000 in pre-tax profits, according to analysts.
Johnson Controls and the UAW have not held discussions since Thursday, and none are scheduled, Steiner said. The two sides are at odds over terms for a new contract.
"
ToddNissen,"In what may be a break in a 15-day strike against a maker of automotive seats, negotiators for Johnson Controls Inc. and the United Auto Workers spoke for several hours late Monday and early Tuesday.
The renewed discussions came hours after Ford Motor Co. said it would re-start its Expedition production line with seats from Lear Corp., Johnson Control's chief competitor in the auto seat business.
""We're hopeful there will be some additional discussions,"" said JCI spokesman Jeff Steiner.
No talks were held later Tuesday, but Steiner characterised the negotiations as being adjourned, compared with previous sessions where talks broke off completely. The two sides had not spoken since late Thursday, Feb. 6.
Unable to agree on terms for a new contract, about 500 UAW members at JCI seat plants in Plymouth, Mich., and Oberlin, Ohio, walked off the job Jan. 28. In addition to the Expedition full-size sport/utility, the plants make seats for Ford's Econoline and Club Wagon full-size vans.
Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacement workers, but continued making vehicles in hopes the strike would be settled soon. After it made 14,800 Expeditions and Econolines without seats, Ford last Friday suspended production on three assembly lines in Michigan and Ohio, idling 6,800 workers.
The automaker reversed direction again Monday, saying it was devising plans to resume Expedition production with seats from Lear. The popular sport/utility, introduced last fall, is one of Ford's most profitable vehicles, earning what analysts estimate at $10,000 each in pre-tax profits.
The Expeditions are made only at Ford's Michigan Assembly plant in Wayne, Mich. Once production resumes, some 4,000 of the 6,800 workers idled would go back to work. The shutdown has been a costly one for Ford. In addition to losing 840 Expeditions a day, the plant has also been forced to halt production of the hot-selling F-150 pickup trucks.
Steiner confirmed that JCI has moved fabrication equipment and frame-making tools out of the Plymouth plant and into its metal seat frame plant in Cadiz, Ky. The plant, which is represented by the United Steelworkers union, is one of six JCI facilities that has union representation. Milwaukee, Wis.-based JCI has a total of 34 plants in the United States.
JCI chose the Cadiz plant because it has extra floor space to accommodate the machinery, Steiner said. Under the plan announced Monday, JCI will make frames for both Lear and Ford. Lear will produce second and third row seats for Expeditions, and Ford will make front-row seats at its Chesterfield, Mich., trim plant.

ToddNissen,"Daily circulation at Detroit's two strike-bound newspapers fell by a third in the first quarter of 1996 from a year ago, according to the first audited figures released since the strike began.
Combined daily circulation of the Free Press and Detroit News was down 33 percent at 576,698 for the January-through-March period, Detroit Newspapers Inc., the joint operating agency that runs two papers, said Friday.
The number, as verified by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, was below the 624,980 that the papers say they distributed, because ABC could not confirm payment or collection for all the papers.
The circulation drop from the same three months in 1995 roughly coincides with the 25 percent to 30 percent decline newspaper officials have acknowledged since the strike began in July 1995.

Circulation for the combined Sunday edition as counted by the Audit Bureau declined to 769,594, a 29 percent drop from 1,085,677 in the year-ago period. Detroit Newspapers said they distributed 844,335 combined Sunday papers.
The Audit Bureau, which contacted thousands of subscribers, had trouble guaranteeing that all of the subscriptions had been paid. They also found some readers were reluctant to admit they read the struck papers, the newspapers said.
Detroit Newspapers officials said they have concentrated more on delivering papers during the strike than on collecting for them.
""As time has gone by, we have been increasingly successful at re-establishing all of our distribution procedures, including billing and collection,"" said Rob Althaus, senior vice president of circulation, in a statement.
The newspapers said their combined daily net paid circulation in the April-through-August period has increased by 25,000, or 4.5 percent, using the Audit Bureau criteria for calculating paid subscribers. Sunday circulation for the same period grew by 18,000, or 2.4 percent.
Roger Kerson, a spokesman for the striking unions, said the audited figures reinforce the unions' position that it was too costly to produce papers under strike conditions.
""They show a critical and devastating loss of readership,"" said Kerson. ""I hope the admission of these horrible circulation numbers will lead to some (bargaining) progress.""
No negotiations were held this week, although some meetings are scheduled for next week, the papers said.

ToddNissen,"MGM Grand Inc.  Wednesday announced a partnership with several prominent local civic and business leaders to build a casino in Detroit, joining a parade of high-profile suitors vying for three downtown gambling licenses.
MGM Chairman Terrence Lanni said following a news conference here that total investment in the proposed casino complex would be more than $400 million.
""It could be more -- I would expect it to be more,"" Lanni said.
Officials from MGM and the nine local partners, mostly African-American, refused to disclose details about the size and theme of their casino plans. They said it would be inappropriate to do so before an application is submitted and city leaders decide where the casino can be built.
Michigan voters last November approved legislation that would grant three licenses for operating casinos in Detroit, making it the largest American city to have legalised gambling.
Two local gambling groups that financed the pro-gambling lobbying efforts last fall are presumed to be in line for two of the licenses. Those companies are Greektown Casino LLC and Atwater Entertainment Inc.
In addition to MGM Grand, casino operators that have expressed interest in Detroit include Harrahs Entertainment Inc., Mirage Resorts Inc. and Circus-Circus Enterprises Inc.
Las Vegas-based MGM is known for its glitzy, entertainment-themed casinos, and Lanni made clear he envisions something similar for Detroit -- possibly involving a Motown theme.
""We're in the gaming entertainment business. We're competing for the entertainment dollar. Unless you have something that is very special, that is something people want to visit and re-visit, you're going to lose out to other entertainment venues,"" Lanni said.
In addition to its reputation, Lanni boasted that MGM has the financial might to build a casino and possibly a hotel in Detroit. The company has received a commitment to boost its line of credit to $1 billion from $600 million.
Lanni also stressed that MGM is a good corporate citizen that would help revitalise the lagging downtown Detroit area if its application was approved. But in an ironic twist, standing behind Lanni at the briefing was Alex Yemenidjian, MGM's president and chief operating officer.
Yemenidjian, who said nothing at the press conference, was a key part of the hostile takeover attempt of Chrysler Corp. by MGM controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian in April 1995. Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. eventually abandoned his effort and signed a truce with Chrysler.
Chrysler Vice Chairman Thomas Denomme was recently appointed chairman of the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the agency charged with licensing and regulating the new casinos.
It was unclear how Denomme would handle his position when it comes to ruling on the MGM application.
The local investment group is led by William Pickard, chairman of Regal Plastics Co. Other investors include Roy S. Roberts, general manager of General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac-GMC division; Anthony Grainer, president and CEO of Malan Realty Investors Inc.; and Dr. Arthur Johnson, retired Wayne State University vice president and vice chairman of New Detroit, Inc.

ToddNissen,"After 19 months of sometimes violent confrontations, six striking newspaper unions on Friday made an unconditional offer to return to work at Detroit's two major daily papers.
Al Derey, head of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions, said the action was not an act of surrender but a tactic to expose the papers to potentially huge financial losses if they do not agree to a fair contract.
""Our position is this strike has not ended. This is simply a new strategy to try to win a fair and decent contract from two corporate giants that don't have any souls,"" a visibly emotional Derey told a news conference.
About 2,500 distribution, pressroom, newsroom and mailroom workers walked off their jobs at the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News in July 1995 after contract talks collapsed.
The papers are editorially indepdendent and have separate owners but have been published under a joint operating agreement since 1989.
Knight-Ridder Inc. owns the Free Press. The News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc.
A representative from Detroit Newspapers Inc, the joint operating agency, could not be reached for comment.
The papers have published every day since the strike began, although early on they only published a single joint edition. More than 400 of the original strikers have cross picket lines. The papers have hired about 1,400 replacements.
Since the start of the strike, which has often erupted in violent confrontations between supporters and private security guards, circulation at the papers has fallen 30 percent. Advertising revenues are down between 15 percent and 20 percent.
Derey told reporters the advertising boycott has cost the papers a combined $250 million, and 700,000 readers have dropped subscriptions. But because the newspapers ""still don't get it,"" he said the unions need to adopt a new strategy.
If the papers reject the return-to-work offer, they could be liable for back pay from the time the offer was made if they were found to have commited unfair labor practices, said Derey. That amounts to $250,000 a day, or $1 million a year, he said.
The action Friday is a controversial one for many union members, who are staunchly opposed to returning to work. But Derey appealed for their support.
""This wasn't the only strategy and it isn't the easiest, but it is the best way we've got to take on these corporate powers and get us moving again down the road to a fair contract,"" he said.
One local labor analyst said the union's move was an acknowledgement the strike as a means of leverage has reached the point of diminishing returns. But it does force management to make some difficult decisions.
""What the unions are doing now is upping the legal ante,"" said Steve Babson, labor program specialist at Wayne State University's Labor Studies Center.
If the papers do not agree to take back all of the striking workers, they could be liable for the back pay penalities if they commited unfair labor practices, a legal process that could take years to resolve, he said.
The Detroit regional director of the NLRB has accused the companies of unfair labor practices, finding they did not bargain in good faith. The company appealed that decision to an administrative law judge, who has not yet issued a ruling.

ToddNissen,"Bargaining between union and American Axle Manufacturing Inc. negotiators was expected to continue up to the midnight Friday deadline to avoid a strike that would quickly paralyze General Motors Corp.'s U.S. light truck production.
About 7,200 United Auto Workers union members were ready to walk off the job at five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., if no agreement was reached on a new three-year contract.
American Axle, which was spun off from GM into a private company in 1994, supplies virtually all of the rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars, as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.
The company also makes axles for Chrysler Corp. and axle shafts for Ford Motor Co..
Tight inventories at American Axle and Dana Corp., the other primary axle maker in the United States, means GM's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week, analysts said.
""They can't have more than two days supply because there is no excess capacity in the industry,"" said James Harbour, president of Harbour &amp; Associates Inc., a Troy, Mich.-based consulting firm.
Burnham Securities Inc. analyst David Healy estimated GM could lose $20 million a day in after-tax profits if it was forced to suspend light truck production. Labor strife cost the world's largest automaker $1.2 billion in 1996.
The American Axle situation is the latest labor dispute to flare up in the automotive supplier industry since the beginning of the year. Analysts say they signal a new era as the UAW steps up efforts to organize more component workforces and bring pay levels in line with those of the Big Three.
""It's the next phase of the evolution of change,"" said Donna Parolini, president of International Business Development Corp., a Troy, Mich. supplier consulting firm.
UAW membership among independent, or non-Big Three, suppliers has dropped dramatically over the last 20 years so that now less than 20 percent of the independent parts workers belong to the UAW, she said.
The American Axle talks are notable because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract. When the firm was spun off under former Chrysler manufacturing chief Richard Dauch, it agreed to uphold terms of the previous UAW contract, which expired last September.
Union officials have said the company is balking at following the Big Three pattern deal hammered out last fall. That contract guarantees employment for 95 percent of current workers, and allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $19.
Amrican Axle, however, wants to start new hires at 60 percent of the base wage -- and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years. The Big Three pact has a ""grow-in"" rate of three years.
Last month, two Johnson Controls Inc. seat plants were hit with strikes by newly organized UAW workers. As of the Friday an agreement had not been reached in the 18-day-old strike.
The walkouts prompted Ford to take the unprecedented action of refusing to accept seats made by non-union replacements. Ford later signed up Johnson Controls' main competitor, Lear Corp., to supply it with seats for the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, one of those affected by the strike.
Parolini released figures Friday that showed the global supplier industry consolidating at a faster rate than previously thought. By the end of this year, there will be about 8,000 suppliers -- down from 30,000 in 1988.
In the past 22 months, there have been more than 320 acqusitions or mergers valued at a total of $32 billion. The mergers will likely result in layoffs as the companies seek to gain efficiencies. For instance, Parolini said companies such as Lear and Johnson Controls have issued internal mandates to reduce headcount by 20 percent next year.

ToddNissen,"Marathon labor contract talks dragged Saturday at a key auto supplier, with some progress being reported in a bid to avoid a strike that would quickly halt light truck production at General Motors Corp.
Bargainers for American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Inc and the United Auto Workers (UAW) had been talking for 35 hours straight as of 5 p.m. Saturday, seeking to hammer out terms for a new three-year contract that would cover 7,200 hourly workers.
A midnight Friday strike deadline set by the UAW expired without any picket action. Union members remained on the job Saturday, as the company proceeded with its normal weekend operations of limited production and maintenance work.
""There is progress,"" said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be named. ""The attitudes are good.""
A strike at American Axle's five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., would shut down light truck production at GM's 11 North American truck plants within days, and create more supplier hardships for Ford Motor Co.
American Axle, which was spun off from GM in 1994, supplies rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars, as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.
The company makes axle shafts that are used by Ford in its F-150 pickup trucks, Expedition and Explorer sport/utilities and some rear-drive passenger cars, although inventories of those supplies are not as critical as the GM parts. It also makes axles for a small number of Chrysler Corp. light truck products.
Tight inventories among axle suppliers means GM's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week, analysts said. The world's largest automaker could lose after-tax profits of $20 million a day if it were forced to suspend light truck production, analysts said.
American Axle and the UAW are at odds over wages and other economic issues as the union seeks to impose on the company the same pattern contract the Big Three automakers agreed to for about 400,000 UAW members last fall.
Automakers guaranteed jobs for 95 percent of their current workforce in a contract that provides $2,000 lump sum payments in the first year and wage hikes of three percent in the second and third years. The pact allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $19.
American Axle, however, wants to start new hires at a lower rate and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years, union officials said. The Big Three pact has a ""grow- in"" rate of three years.
But if the company were forced to match the Big Three pattern it would be at a severe cost disadvantage against its competitors, a company spokesman has said.
The American Axle talks have drawn attention because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract.
Meantime, a UAW strike against Johnson Controls Inc, a key seat supplier for Ford, entered its 19th day Saturday with no settlement.

A strike at American Axle would virtually shut down light truck production at General Motors Corp's 11 North American truck plants within days, and create more supply hardships for Ford Motor Co.
United Auto Workers leaders have not officially extended the strike deadline, but they also have not authorized members to start picketing, union members said on Saturday.

"
ToddNissen,"American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Inc. reached a tentative contract with the United Auto Workers minutes before a strike deadline Monday morning, sparing General Motors Corp. a potentially punishing work stoppage.
Details of the agreement were withheld pending ratification by about 7,200 UAW members at five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., Buffalo, N.Y., and Tonawanda, N.Y., later this week.
UAW President Stephen Yokich and Vice President Richard Shoemaker released a statement describing the pact as ""an excellent new agreement."" Company officials did not return telephone calls.
The tentative contract was reached 15 minutes before the 7 a.m. strike deadline. Union and company bargainers negotiated through a midnight Friday deadline and nearly non-stop over the weekend, while UAW members stayed on the job and refrained from putting up picket lines.
But by late Sunday evening no agreement had been reached, and UAW officials set the Monday strike deadline to put more pressure on the company.
American Axle supplies rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear- drive cars, as well as parts for other passenger cars.
A strike would have forced the world's largest automaker to suspend production at its 11 North American light truck plants within two days, according to analysts, because of tight axle inventories throughout the auto industry. That could have cost GM $20 million a day in profits, analysts said.
A work stoppage would also have added to Ford Motor Co.'s supplier headaches. American Axle makes axle shafts for Ford's F-150 pickup trucks, Expedition and Explorer sport utility vehicles, as well as some rear-drive cars. The company also makes a small number of parts for Chrysler Corp.
GM spokesman Gerald Holmes said Monday the automaker did not alter its contract with American Axle to pave the way for a settlement.
""We had no part in it at all,"" he said.
American Axle was spun off from GM in 1994 to a group of investors led by former Chrysler manufacturing chief Richard Dauch. As part of the deal, the components maker agreed to honour the terms of the 1993-96 UAW-GM contract.
In the talks that wrapped up Monday -- the first time a GM spin-off had to negotiate a new contract -- UAW officials had been pressing for American Axle to follow the pattern the Big Three agreed to during their contract talks last fall.
Company officials were reluctant to do that, however, claiming that would put them at a competitive disadvantage with their competitors.

WilliamKazer,"With just 100 days before China regains its coveted prize of Hong Kong, Beijing has sidestepped the colony's departing British masters and made sure new local leaders know where to take their cue.
China has made clear its intention to mould the territory's politics more in its own image, mapping plans to dismantle the elected legislature and water down civil liberties laws while telling Britain that objections were pointless.
""China is firmly in charge,"" said a Beijing-based diplomat.
Chinese Premier Li Peng has brushed aside London's hopes of monitoring the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong after the handover, proclaiming that Beijing would implement the accord as it saw fit.
""I think this is unrealistic,"" Li said when asked about British plans to review the pact's implementation after the transfer of power. ""After July 1, Hong Kong's sovereignty returns to China.""
Under the 1984 accord, China has pledged to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover.
Beijing has also ensured that the future administrators of the territory are firmly in its camp.
Since his selection by a group of 400 people vetted by Beijing, Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting Tung Chee-hwa has shown little enthusiasm for staking out positions differing from China's official party line.
BEIJING LIKES WHAT IT HEARS
The shipping tycoon-turned-politician, who has shuttled between Hong Kong and Beijing since he was named chief executive-designate last December, has echoed China's views on issues ranging from the territory's future legislature to civil liberties and textbook revisions.
He has also hurled barbs at Hong Kong democratic activists who have been critical of China.
Beijing has responded by showing its pleasure.
The official media have described Tung in a somewhat more flattering fashion than that reserved for the territory's current and last colonial governor, Chris Patten, who has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over his efforts to expand democratic institutions in the final years of British rule.
In a sign of official favour, cameras of China's national television lingered on Tung when he attended funeral rites last month for late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man credited with directing the strategy that enabled Beijing to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong.
""Mr Tung knows that if he doesn't carry out Beijing's wishes, someone else will,"" said a Western diplomat in Beijing.
Other analysts in Beijing are willing to wait before making a judgment on Tung.
""He has to establish his credibility with the Chinese,"" said a foreign diplomat in Beijing who follows Hong Kong affairs.
WILL TUNG STAND UP FOR HONG KONG?
""The question is, will he stand up for Hong Kong's interests in the future?""
Some people are not so sure.
""That is the charitable assessment,"" said one foreign diplomat in Hong Kong.
He and other analysts suggest that Tung may be more like many of Hong Kong's business leaders who are often reluctant to confront Beijing in public, whatever the issue.
The analysts note opposition can be costly.
Jardine Matheson, one of the colony's oldest trading houses, was publicly vilified by Beijing after its directors supported political reforms proposed by Patten. It has since worked hard to mend its relationship.
Businessman Jimmy Lai printed vitriolic comments about China's premier in his Next magazine in 1994. Lai's Giordano clothing outlets ran into problems with authorities in China and he eventually sold his share in the firm.
Many businessmen would probably prefer to see their names linked to more soothing comments to Beijing's ears, such as those of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, on the contribution of China's late leader Deng Xiaoping.
An article by Li that was published prominently in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, praised the late party patriarch, his chosen successor and the future system for Hong Kong, all making deft use of communist jargon.
But diplomats said that for political leaders such as Tung, there is a considerable risk in being perceived as too willing to speak out on behalf of Beijing.
China wants a popular leader who can rally the territory's 6.4 million people to Beijing's cause, they said.
If its interests clash with those of Hong Kong, and Tung is perceived merely as Beijing's willing tool, the future leader risks losing his still high popular support.
""China chose him because he was acceptable to many people and would do its bidding,"" said a diplomat. ""If he loses popularity in Hong Kong, that complicates matters for Beijing.""

WilliamKazer,"China gave new details on Wednesday of the failed launch of a satellite aboard its Long March 3B rocket in February, confirming that the cause lay with the new generation launcher.
The report concluded that the failure of the Long March 3B was due to an electrical problem in the power module of the ""inertial platform"" that operated the rocket's direction controls.
""There was no electric current output from the power module in the servo-loop on the follow-up frame of the inertia platform,"" a spokesman for the China Great Wall Industrial Corp, which handles China's launches, quoted the report as saying.
""All other systems operated normally,"" the report said.
The initial report had said briefly that the problem was a failure of the rocket's inertial platform.
The Long March 3B, which was being used in a launch for the first time, veered wildly seconds after lift-off from the Xichang satellite centre in southwestern Sichuan province.
It ended its flight in a spectacular explosion that destroyed the rocket and the U.S.-made Intelsat satellite it was carrying.
The latest report said the rocket smashed into a hillside 1.85 km (1.2 miles) from the launch site.
Official reports said six people were killed and 57 injured, although a video smuggled out by an Israeli scientist showed extensive damage to buildings in the area, suggesting that the number of casualties might have been considerably higher.
The final report said that because of the severity of the explosion, no large pieces of wreckage of the satellite or the rocket remained.
The report's conclusions were drawn largely from film of the launch and data from remote testing.
China's space programme once had a reputation for dependability, but has been marred by a string of recent failures.
It suffered a blow to its hopes to capture a significant share of the commercial satellite launch market when a Long March 3 rocket failed to lift a U.S.-built satellite into proper orbit last month.
The preliminary conclusion blamed the failure on a problem with the third-stage booster of the Long March 3 rocket, which is supposed to be one of China's most reliable launch vehicles.
China has come under pressure from potential foreign customers as well as the insurance industry to disclose more information on the problems with its launches so far.
In January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, destroying the Apstar 2 satellite and killing six people on the ground.
However, China successfully launched Hong Kong's Apstar 1A telecommunications satellite in July after delaying the launch following last February's Long March 3B explosion.
"
WilliamKazer,"U.S. Vice President Al Gore arrived in Beijing on Monday to heal Sino-U.S. ties and pave the way for an exchange of presidential visits amid controversy about possible Chinese efforts to influence U.S. elections.
Gore told reporters before he left Tokyo for Beijing that he would not shy away from issues such as human rights in talks with Chinese leaders during his four-day visit, but had no plans for specific meetings with human rights activists.
Speaking after a 24-hour stay in Tokyo Gore said, however, that he could not rule out talks with activists at U.S. embassy functions while he was in China.
The controversy over U.S. accusations that China may have made illegal contributions to the Democratic Party cast a cloud over the four-day visit aimed at healing ties damaged by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan.
The official People's Daily said on Monday the Chinese government had not made any payments to the Democratic Party and that an improvement in Sino-U.S. ties was due to efforts by the two governments and their people.
Asked what U.S. concerns he would raise in Beijing, Gore replied: ""I will, of course, discuss human rights in my meetings with the leadership of China, nor will it be a surprise to them to hear these matters raised.""
But he added: ""I have no specific meeting of that kind (planned with human rights activists).""
Human rights abuses in China have long been a sore spot in Sino-U.S. relations, particularly since China called in the army to crush a student-led democracy movement in Beijing in 1989.
Gore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then President George Bush, who toured China just months before the 1989 crackdown that sent Sino-U.S. ties into a tailspin.
In its annual report on human rights, the U.S. State Department accused Beijing of effectively silencing public dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.
Sino-U.S. relations had been strained by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan, but Washington and Beijing have worked hard to improve ties in recent months.
Gore's trip to China, part of an Asian tour that includes South Korea, is aimed at paving the way for an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin over the next year.
The sister of China's most prominent dissident has appealed to Gore to ask Beijing to free him from a 14-year jail term when he meets China's leaders on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The health of veteran dissident Wei Jingsheng was deteriorating in a Chinese jail and his requests for medical care had been ignored by prison authorities, a U.S.-based human rights group quoted his family as saying after a recent visit.
In a letter to Gore, Wei's sister called on the U.S. vice president to use the opportunity of his meetings this week with Chinese leaders to appeal for the release of her brother.
""I ask you to appeal to the Chinese government for my brother's prompt release and, until prior to his release, for his parole for medical treatment,"" wrote Wei Shanshan in a letter dated March 4, a copy of which was made available by the New York-based group Human Rights in China.
Although U.S. officials were negotiating with their Chinese counterparts to try to hammer out various agreements in time for Gore's trip, no dramatic breakthroughs are expected.
In fact, Gore's advisers had a debate over whether he should even participate in a signing ceremony in which China plans to order new aircraft from Boeing Co, a move that will generate jobs and benefit the U.S. economy.
Although officials said there was no doubt Gore would participate in such an event if a final contract was reached, the fact there was any question underscored the sensitivity of the political funding issue.
"
WilliamKazer,"China said on Monday it had not made contributions to the U.S. Democratic Party to influence American policy and the visit by U.S. Vice President Al Gore had no link to improper payments.
The official People's Daily also pointed an accusing finger at Taiwan for stirring up accusations of Chinese involvement to try to shift blame from itself.
""The Chinese government is not involved in the so-called 'political contributions scandal' in the slightest way and is entirely free of guilt,"" said the newspaper in a signed commentary.
The Washington Post has reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of Congress last year that they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign corporations.
""The development of Sino-U.S. relations is based on principles,"" the People's Daily said.
Gore is scheduled to arrive in Beijing later on Monday, making him the most senior U.S. official to visit in eight years.
His trip is aimed at healing ties that had been badly strained by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan.
It is also intended to pave the way for an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
""The continuation of high level visits, such as the visit of U.S. Vice President Gore and others, is due to the efforts of the two governments and their peoples,"" the newspaper said.
""To insist that this is linked to the so-called contributions scandal is ridiculous,"" it said. ""It is a complete fabrication to allege that the improvement in Sino-U.S. relations is due to any improper payments by the Chinese government.""
The People's Daily commentary condemned Taiwan as well as news organisations from the island for the storm of criticism that has engulfed China.
""It is widely known that the 'political payments case' stems from Taiwan,"" the newspaper said.
It referred to a report last year by a Hong Kong publication, the Chinese language edition of Asiaweek magazine, that said Liu Tai-ying, head of the business management committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, had expressed a willingness to contribute $15 million.
The People's Daily did not mention that Taiwan has denied the allegations and has sued the magazine.
""For some Taiwan politicians it appears that the best way out of their troubles is to put the blame elsewhere,"" said the newspaper.
Taiwan and China have been rivals since the Nationalists fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists in 1949.
The United States formally recognises China but maintains trade and other unofficial ties with Taiwan.
Washington sent warships near Taiwan in a show of support when Beijing staged war games and missile tests to intimidate the island early last year.
"
WilliamKazer,"China has made a gesture to the United States by ordering Boeing jets but it has left the door open to the aircraft maker's European rival in a thinly veiled mix of politics and commerce, analysts said on Tuesday.
They said improving Sino-U.S. ties, highlighted by the visit of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, had enabled Boeing Co to sign a pact to sell five 777s to Air China for $685 million.
But Beijing was holding back orders for planes it clearly needed, keeping a close eye on the progress of Sino-U.S. ties and squeezing maximum concessions from Washington on a range of trade issues, they said.
""This is a very political game,"" said a foreign diplomat.
""The Chinese are moving ahead cautiously. The decisions are made by (Premier) Li Peng himself.""
Diplomats said new deals for Boeing or rival Airbus Industrie could be linked to China's campaign to join the World Trade Organisation.
The United States has been the most vocal advocate of wresting further concessions from China in liberalising its domestic market before it is allowed to join the trade body.
Beijing may also be hoping to make progress in its bid to persuade Washington to grant it permanent most favoured nation trading status to avoid an annual review.
Boeing officials said they had been looking to sell 10 of their twin-engine 777s to Air China, the main Chinese international carrier.
They insisted the smaller-than-hoped-for order, delayed by more than one year by Sino-U.S. friction, was a commercial decision and they were confident of making more sales for the same type of plane in future.
China often assails the West for mixing trade and diplomacy.
But the political drama behind the Boeing deal was highlighted by the signing ceremony in the Great Hall of the People as both Gore and Premier Li looked on.
Gore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-president George Bush travelled to Beijing in early 1989 -- just months before a crackdown on democracy protests in the Chinese capital's Tiananmen Square.
""Airbus will be disappointed at today's order,"" said a another Western diplomat.
""They were looking to sell the A330-300,"" a twin-engine jet that Airbus says it has not yet sold in China.
But Boeing has hardly dealt its key rival a knockout blow.
""This is not a mega-order,"" said an industry analyst.
The next sign of how political ties translate into contracts could emerge at the forthcoming visit by French President Jacques Chirac.
Analysts said they would watch closely to see whether new plane orders go to Airbus Industrie and how many planes were purchased.
China has said it will put in service some 240 more planes during the current five-year plan ending in the year 2000 to keep up with rising demand for domestic and international air travel. Most of those planes have yet to be ordered.
Boeing officials, quoting Chinese data, said they were well ahead in the China market so far with some 216 planes in service against 29 for Airbus.
But Boeing underwent a dry spell in 1996, notching only a handful of sales in a year in which Sino-U.S. ties were rocked by Beijing's sabre-rattling aimed at Taiwan as well as disputes over trade, arms control and human rights.
Airbus signed a pact for 30 of the Airbus A320 narrow body jets in April last year in a deal worth $1.5 billion.
Those planes compete with Boeing's smaller 737 jets.
Boeing officials said that with some of the political friction out of the way, they expect more market inroads, and note the latest deal brings this year's sales to $1.2 billion.
But analysts cautioned that despite the improvement in Sino-U.S. ties, issues between the two states were unlikely to be resolved soon and would add a political tint to future commercial deals.
"
WilliamKazer,"Boeing Co on Tuesday signed a $685 million contract to sell jets to China with Vice President Al Gore on hand, signalling a boost in business relations after Beijing only a year ago had turned to European rival Airbus.
Boeing and Chinese aviation officials inked a contract for five 777-200 jets in a ceremony at the cavernous Great Hall of the People, also attended by Chinese Premier Li Peng.
Under the accord, Chinese state-run international carrier Air China will take delivery of the planes in 1998 and 1999.
""Air China's order is a vote of confidence in the world's best-selling airplane in its market,"" said Ronald Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
Woodard told reporters both sides had reached basic agreement a year ago, but signing faced lengthy delays because of political differences between China and the United States.
""There is no doubt the contract was not executed when it was ready because of tension between the U.S. and China last year and the year before,"" he told reporters at a news briefing after the ceremony.
""There are times when politics are involved,"" he said.
A year ago, China and the United States were at odds over a range of issues from trade and human rights to Beijing's sabre-rattling over Taiwan.
Chinese Premier Li Peng was also on hand when Beijing turned to the European consortium Airbus Industrie in April last year, buying 30 airliners in a $1.5 billion deal.
Since then, Sino-U.S. tensions have eased as the two sides have made painstaking efforts to patch up their differences.
The Gore visit is aimed at ensuring that trend continues.
Gore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-president George Bush travelled to Beijing in early 1989 -- just months before a crackdown on democracy protests in the Chinese capital's Tiananmen Square.
Boeing officials tried to play down last minute questions about whether Gore would attend the signing ceremony, saying there never was any doubt.
""I was told he'd be there and he was,"" said Woodard.
U.S. officials and Boeing were non-committal as late as on Monday about Gore's plans.
The Clinton administration has been on the defensive over accusations of illegal Chinese contributions to the Democratic Party.
China has angrily denounced the allegations, insisting that it did not make any payments and saying that rival Taiwan may be behind its current difficulties.
The Washington Post has said the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of Congress last year that they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign corporations.
Boeing officials said they hoped the United States would take further steps to keep the relationship healthy.
""We strongly and fully support granting China permanent Most Favoured Nation status and China's accession to the World Trade Organisation. Both are critical to achieving normalised world trade,"" Woodard said.
China has sought permanent preferential trade status from the United States to avoid an annual review.
It has also pushed for entry into the global trade body, but Washington has insisted that Beijing agree to liberalise more of its trade policies first.
Boeing walked away from the latest contract signing ceremony with a bit less than it wanted.
Company officials said they had been hoping to sell 10 of the 777s to China. They said, however, this was a commercial decision and they were hopeful of further orders in the future.
"
WilliamKazer,"A top Chinese official for contacts with Taiwan ruled out an early resumption of talks on reunification because the island's leaders were pursuing ""splittist"" policies, the China Daily said on Tuesday.
It also quoted Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), as saying that Taiwanese authorities did not want the handover of Hong Kong to go smoothly and might try to disrupt the transfer of power.
""In the long term the mainland and Taiwan should sit down at the negotiating table to discuss cross-straits issues under the 'one-China' policy,"" Tang was quoted as saying.
But he said the atmosphere for talks would not improve in the short term unless Taiwan's leaders, including its ""so-called"" President Lee Teng-hui, halted their ""splittist"" activities aimed at independence for the island.
China and Taiwan have been rivals since the Nationalist government fled to the island after its defeat by the communists in the Chinese civil war in 1949.
Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and tries to isolate it diplomatically.
Talks between the two sides were broken off after President Lee made a landmark private visit to the United States in mid-1995, enraging Beijing.
""We have the patience to handle the issue of the peaceful reunification of the motherland,"" Tang said.
The newspaper also said Taiwan authorities would likely take measures to reduce the impact on the island from the success of China's policies towards Hong Kong, which reverts to Beijing sovereignty on July 1 after 150 years of British rule.
""According to Tang, there is information that Taiwan forces in Hong Kong are planning to cause trouble, such as demonstrations around July 1, when China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over the territory,"" the newspaper said.
Tang also repeated Beijing's long-held stance that the United States should halt arms sales to Taiwan.
The Chinese official's remarks were published by the English language newspaper as the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was visiting Taiwan.
Beijing insists the 1989 winner of the Nobel Peace prize is waging a campaign for independence for Tibet.
Tang made no mention of Beijing's announcement last week that it would return a Taiwanese man suspected of hijacking a Taiwan passenger jet to mainland China.
Beijing wants Taiwan to return Chinese hijackers now in Taiwanese jails but so far it has been disappointed.
"
WilliamKazer,"China's stock regulators are trying to reassert control over what they see as backdoor listings of Chinese companies in Hong Kong, market sources said on Thursday.
They said the new concerns were triggered by the listing this week of GITIC Enterprises, a Hong Kong company that is controlled indirectly by the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp (GITIC), based in the south China city of Guangzhou.
They said the problem was particularly sensitive because of the territory's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1 under a Sino-British accord that promises a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer of political power.
""The (Chinese) authorities are certainly worried about this issue and we could see some guidelines emerge before too long,"" said a securities industry executive.
A foreign securities company executive agreed.
""China is worried that a number of good companies will inject mainland assets into Hong Kong companies and then take them public without their approval.""
Chinese companies that wish to list shares abroad, usually in Hong Kong, need clearance from a number of central government regulatory bodies, including the watchdog agency, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
Rules for Hong Kong companies controlled by Chinese interests are less clear, but recently many of these firms have first gained approval from Beijing.
GITIC Enterprises did not get prior clearance and regulatory objections are believed to have presented a last-minute hurdle.
The offer was allowed to proceed, however, and was a stunning success. The issue, nearly 900 times subscribed, finished its first day of trading on Wednesday at HK$4.375 compared with its offer price of HK$1.05.
""The company is listed now so there is no need to address the issue of whether the CSRC was involved,"" said an official of parent company GITIC, speaking by telephone from Guangzhou.
At least two more Hong Kong-registered companies controlled by Chinese firms from Beijing and Tianjin were preparing to offer shares in Hong Kong. They were likely to wait for Chinese regulatory clearance, sources said.
Another Guangdong company has postponed plans for an offer of shares by a Hong Kong company it controls because of the latest developments, said sources in Beijing and Hong Kong.
""The problem is mainly with Guangdong province,"" said a regulator in Beijing.
Guangdong, far from the reach of authorities in Beijing and backed by considerable financial muscle, has often been at odds with central government directives.
The scope of control over Hong Kong is even more sensitive.
The CSRC and other financial regulators have repeatedly said they would not interfere in supervisory matters in Hong Kong, in keeping with Beijing's promises for the territory after the handover.
An official at the CSRC was unable to clarify the extent of the agency's regulatory powers on this issue.
""I can't comment,"" said the official. ""It is too sensitive.""
Securities regulators in Guangdong underscored the problem of reaching agreement on the issue.
""When a company seeks permission from the CSRC we are usually aware of it,"" said a provincial regulatory official.
""But a Hong Kong-registered company does not necessarily have to go through the CSRC.""
"
WilliamKazer,"China published on Saturday a list of anti-dumping rules to protect local companies from unfair foreign competition.
Chinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies, many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas, protect their share of the domestic market.
They also said the move appeared to be aimed at giving a legal framework to protection from unfair competition and clarifying procedures for its use.
""Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices,"" economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council (cabinet) development research centre told Reuters.
""Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies,"" he said.
The rules, published in the official People's Daily, give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment.
Prices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty.
The rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation. Special cases are allowed to take 18 months.
The rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose ""discriminatory"" countervailing duties against Chinese goods.
Beijing's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Many domestic manufacturers were pressuring the government to take steps to offset these policies, newspapers have said.
Other economists said China was trying to codify the protection of its industries and bring its trade policies more in line with international practice.
They added that as China sought to join the World Trade Organisation it was being forced to make its polices more transparent.

WilliamKazer,"The United States and China may not be on the verge of a breakthrough in often testy ties, but both sides can claim gains from visits by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, analysts said on Monday.
The key objective for the two sides was to ensure they moved closer to the goal of an exchange of presidential visits, putting the final seal on efforts to repair damaged relations.
""Gore's visit took them one step closer to that goal,"" said a foreign diplomat in Beijing.
Gore reassured the Chinese that Washington remained committed to an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin, telling reporters that officials from both countries were working on specific dates.
The United States and China have been moving painstakingly to ease strains over disputes ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights.
Gore, the most senior U.S. official in Beijing since the 1989 crackdown on student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, said his talks with Chinese leaders last week touched on the key areas of disagreement but he described China's reaction as milder than in the past.
While the speaker of the House of Representatives had somewhat tougher talk in public for his Chinese hosts, pointedly referring to Beijing's policies on human rights and Taiwan, the content was not unexpected.
""He is a bit less constrained in what he can say,"" said a Chinese journalist who covers foreign affairs. ""China recognises this.""
More importantly for China's leaders, the visit by the key Republican and other members of a bipartisan congressional delegation presented an opportunity for Beijing to make a personal pitch on major issues such as Taiwan.
Jiang used his meeting with Gingrich on Friday to note how pleased he was that more congressmen were visiting China to see first hand the importance of the Taiwan issue to Beijing.
China and Taiwan, rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, are vying for the sympathies of American policymakers and the public.
The United States recognises China but has strong commercial and other unofficial ties with the island that Beijing views as a renegade province.
Beijing believes it was misled by Washington over the landmark 1995 visit to the U.S. by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui. The administration assured Beijing that no visit would be permitted but the trip was allowed to proceed under pressure from Congress.
Both Washington and Beijing struggled to ensure that accusations of illegal Chinese funding for the Democratic Party did not overshadow the Gore visit.
Gore reassured Beijing that unless there was firm evidence of illegal payments, the issue would not affect U.S. policy.
The visit also underscored Washington's hopes that no one issue be allowed to dominate the Sino-U.S. relationship.
""Trade issues as well as human rights will all remain on the table for discussion in the future,"" said another diplomat. If there was any one area where specific progress could be expected soon, perhaps it was trade, another diplomat said.
American figures put the U.S. trade deficit with China at about $40 billion last year, and Washington has been pushing for greater access to the China market to narrow the gap.
Chinese officials have conceded they are concerned over the trade issue.
During the Gore visit, U.S. aircraft maker Boeing nailed down a $685 million jet sale and General Motors gained clearance for a long-stalled car venture.
""We may see more such big contracts in the coming months,"" said a diplomat. ""But a $40 billion (U.S.) trade deficit is not going to go away overnight.""
"
WilliamKazer,"The Australian stock exchange on Tuesday used the China visit of Prime Minister John Howard to make a high profile sales pitch for Chinese companies to list shares on Australia's stock market.
The Australian prime minister, before meeting China's President Jiang Zemin, found time to open a seminar for China's market regulators and top-level managers of its state-run companies designed to show them why they should look to Australia to raise capital.
Senior officials from the Australian Stock Exchange as well as brokerages and legal firms delivered the message that Australia had much to offer.
""Cross-border equities trading now amounts to around $4 trillion a year, which no stock market can afford to ignore,"" Australian Stock Exchange chairman Maurice Newman told the seminar.
""I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market.""
Most Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks.
One recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed, and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest.
Newman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection. These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing, in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country.
Trading in some of those issues has not been active.
""The liquidity of those companies is mixed,"" said Newman. ""As a group we would prefer that it were greater.""
Australia may soon get its first direct Chinese listing.
Taihang Cement, a cement producer based in the northern province of Hebei, has already gained approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a foreign listing.
Company officials told reporters they hoped to list their shares in Australia by the year-end.
""We chose Australia because we have a foundation there,"" said Zhang Zhixian, Taihang's manager of investment development, noting that the company exports cement to Australia.
Company officials said the exact size of the offer had not been set but would range between 100 and 200 million yuan ($12-24 million).
Other participants at the seminar said Australia might target its efforts at sectors where Australia is already strong, such as in natural resources.
""Australia would have a natural advantage in infrastructure and resource-based companies,"" said Tony Greenwood, of law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, noting the heavy weighting of such stocks in Australia.
One area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency, which has posed a problem for them in the past.
Some Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency.
""Our concern must also be the integrity of our market,"" said Newman.
""It is important that companies are familiar with our listing requirements and they observe them faithfully.""
"
WilliamKazer,"China marked on Saturday the first ""tombsweeping"" day since the death of Deng Xiaoping with few outward signs of remembrance for the late paramount leader.
Thousands of Beijing residents streamed through the gates of Babaoshan cemetery for the Qingming festival, traditionally the day for tidying ancestral graves.
But for the most part this was a family occasion, far removed from the political limelight that surrounded Deng during his lifetime.
""I have come here every year since my husband died in 1991,"" said a Beijing resident, holding the hand of her granddaughter as they left the cemetery.
""This is a family matter. There is no connection with any political leaders.""
A group of students from Deng's native province of Sichuan, all of them enrolled at a university in the Chinese capital, gathered at the cemetery gates. They too had a private reason for being there.
""We are helping a friend sweep his father's grave,"" said one of the students.
Deng died on February 19 aged 92. He was cremated at Babaoshan and his ashes scattered at sea in accordance with his wishes.
That has left the public with no specific place to honour the man who steered China away from the radical policies of Mao Zedong and onto the path of economic development, even if it meant adopting capitalist ways.
Those pragmatic policies raised living standards and turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.
Beijing's central Tiananmen Square has been one such place to honour the nation's fallen heroes but public displays of respect were not encouraged on this day.
Early on Saturday, as a group of secondary students walked towards the shrine to martyrs of the revolution at the centre of the square, they were quickly approached by security men.
After a brief discussion, they were allowed to bow and then told to leave, witnesses said.
China's communist leaders have traditionally planted trees on the Qingming festival and that was how the official media chose to remember Deng.
The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, showed photographs of Deng planting trees over the years since 1979, when he began his programme of reforms that changed China's political landscape.
""Now these trees have grown tall,"" said the newspaper.
In the spirit of Deng's reforms, vendors of silk flowers were doing brisk business outside the Babaoshan cemetery.
Visitors queued up to buy wreaths similar to those that adorned grave sites inside.
Deng was in the thoughts of other Beijing residents, such as Bai Lansheng, a sculptor who is working on a bronze statue of the late leader.
""We are getting ready to ship the plaster mould to Shanghai now,"" he said from his Beijing workshop. ""There it will be cast in bronze.""
In June the six-metre (20-foot) statue will be shipped to the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders the British colony of Hong Kong.
Deng directed negotiations that led to the 1984 Sino-British accord under which the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.

WilliamKazer,"The CITIC Industrial Bank, financial arm of China's CITIC conglomerate, said on Monday it expected solid profit growth this year despite mounting competition and a key goal of limiting risk.
""Stable development is more important than a big profit rise,"" said Zhang Jian, deputy general manager and economist.
The bank has set a target of pre-tax profits of at least 1.8 billion yuan ($217 million) this year compared with 1.58 billion in 1996 and 1.01 billion in 1995.
The bank is a major profit contributor to the China International Trust and Development Corp, or CITIC, which has interests from telecommunications to real estate and manufacturing. The CITIC group announced overall earnings of 2.478 billion yuan last year.
China's economic tsar Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has pushed for more discipline in the financial sector, particularly following the failure in January of the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp. That sent shock waves through the financial community, and Zhu has warned that state banks overall need to cut bad debt by two percent annually over the next five years.
CITIC Industrial Bank has been one of the stronger players in the financial sector, however.
Unlike the main state-run commercial banks, it does not have to make loans to aid government policy, regardless of whether the borrower can repay.
But Zhang said top management at the bank was focusing on tightening risk controls.
""Enhancing (asset) quality and the assessment of risk"" were two key goals for the bank this year, he said in an interview.
CITIC's customers for the most part were profitable state industrial companies and government corporations engaged in foreign trade. Most of the bank's loans were short term, usually for less than 180 days, Zhang said.
That has made it difficult for the bank to move into new areas of business such as home mortgages or car financing, two areas where China is likely to see substantial growth in the years ahead.
CITIC is also facing an increasingly crowded banking sector as new domestic banks emerge and more foreign banks enter the local market.
Zhang said CITIC had begun private banking operations at its branch in the southern city of Guangzhou to try to expand business.
It is experimenting with ways to boost service to its big corporate clients, such as extending banking hours and installing computers at customer offices and linking them to its own network to make banking easier.
CITIC had total assets of 108 billion yuan at the end of last year compared with 86 billion at the end of 1995.
Deposits reached 87 billion yuan last year, up from 67 billion in 1995, despite two reductions in domestic interest rates by the central bank last year.
Zhang said he believed further cuts in interest rates would make it difficult for the nation's banks to attract deposits.
""I don't think there can be another interest rate cut this year,"" he said. ""If you want investment, you need savings to support it.""

WilliamKazer,"China called on Japan on Thursday to stop encouraging right-wing activities on disputed South China Sea islands or risk an escalation of the diplomatic row.
However, it stopped short of spelling out what action it would take over the islands -- claimed by Beijing, Tokyo and Taipei -- adding that it would exercise restraint.
""Japan should recognise the seriousness of the matter and take actions to stop these...illegal activities,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing.
""If Japan continues to encourage them the situation will be even more serious,"" he said of the right-wing activists. ""The ball is in Japan's court.""
A long-dormant dispute over the islands, called the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus by Japan, erupted in July after the right-wing Japan Youth Federation erected a lighthouse on one of the islets.
Friction mounted earlier this month after Japanese coast-guard ships barred private Taiwan boats from reaching the area while the rightist group repaired the typhoon-damaged structure.
Beijing and Taipei have assailed Japan's protection of the rightists' activities and ordered Tokyo to keep people away from the islands that lie east of China's southeastern Fujian coast, west of Japan's Okinawa island and northeast of Taiwan.
Chinese in the British colony of Hong Kong have also closed ranks, ignoring other political disputes and voicing support for Beijing's claim to the islands.
On Tuesday, Beijing lodged a strong protest with Tokyo and called in the charge d'affaires in Beijing, warning of serious damage to ties if Japan failed to stop right-wingers from setting foot on the islands.
Asked by reporters whether Beijing would consider stronger measures, Shen said: ""We hope this issue will be handled with restraint.""
Japan on Thursday urged China, Taiwan and Hong Kong to deal calmly with the territorial dispute.
A group of more than 100 Chinese nationalists on Wednesday urged China's top military brass to send warships to the disputed Diaoyu islands to tear down structures built by Japanese rightists.
The response of China's military commission, which is headed by Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin, was not immediately available.
Hong Kong activists, members of the pro-democracy Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, were in Beijing to present to Chinese authorities a petition signed by 17,000 people urging the government to get tough on Japan's claim to the islands.
In Taiwan on Thursday, fishermen hurled rotten fish at Japan's Taipei visa office in protest over Tokyo's actions in the dispute.

WilliamKazer,"China has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on Friday that price rises this year could be well below target.
Some economists say inflation had been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.
""This is better than expected,"" said Chen Dezun, head of the price research institute of the State Planning Commission.
""We could see inflation of between three and four percent this year,"" he told Reuters.
The benchmark retail price index rose a meagre 1.7 percent in March and 2.6 percent for the first quarter of the year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.
China forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year. That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
China's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.
The inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.
Chen said good weather had been a factor, ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.
What China officially refers to as ""appropriately tight"" monetary policies had also been a crucial factor, he said.
""The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results,"" he said.
China has kept controls on fixed asset investment, keeping government spending down, and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.
After adjusting for inflation, the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.
""The key has been control over fixed asset investment,"" said Zhong Jiyun, an economist at the state think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Some economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably, China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.
Many inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they cannot repay.
Managers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.
But Zhong is among the economists who believe that China is not yet able to declare the war on inflation over.
""I believe we still need to keep the controls on,"" he said.

WilliamKazer,"China is on target with plans to to promote 100 large chemical groups by 2000 by tapping a $1.6 billion war chest, Minister of Chemical Industry Gu Xiulian said on Friday.
The industry hoped that 10 of the groups, which are being groomed to compete in the export market, could eventually list their shares either on domestic or foreign stock exchanges, she said.
""Currently, we have 13.6 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) to support development plans,"" Gu told reporters. ""Some of this was made available under the previous five-year plan (1991-1995). All of the money is to support development projects.""
China has been trying to promote big companies to give its ailing state sector a more competitive edge.
""One of the problems in the industry is that we've had too much small-scale production which was protected under central planning. But now we have a market economy,"" Gu said.
The government aimed to build up companies which could each export $10 million worth of chemicals a year. There were now 80 such companies, she added.
Asked about plans to publicly list the firms, Gu did not name any company or group but said the ministry's policy was to support companies ready to go public.
Listing plans would then require approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, China's top securities watchdog.
Chemical companies Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry (Group) Co Ltd and Jilin Chemical Industry Co Ltd are some of the companies listed in China and abroad.
Gu said some of the state-run chemical companies were among the firms losing money, and that subsidiaries were needed to offset rising raw material costs. She did not mention any companies by name but said chemical fertilisers were one area where subsidiaries were necessary.

WilliamKazer,"China may need to adjust the mix of its treasury debt next year to ensure an active response from domestic institutions, analysts said on Friday.
Finance ministry officials were meeting in Beijing on Friday to discuss bond market trends and the issue of China's debt mix could be a focus of the talks, the analysts said.
""There is too much of the non-tradeable type of debt,"" said a Shenzhen analyst. ""It is not really attractive to institutions or individual investors.""
China is issuing about 250 billion yuan ($30.1 billion) of state debt this year -- most of it domestic. More than half of the total is for non-tradeable voucher or certificate type treasury debt.
In return for their funds, investors receive a certificate that can be redeemed before maturity. But this type of debt is not listed on either of the nation's stock exchanges in Shanghai or Shenzhen and no active secondary trading exists.
Last year, this non-tradeable type of debt accounted for only about one-tenth of total government debt issued, bond traders said.
""Last year the focus was on the secondary market,"" said a trader with J&amp;A Securities in Shenzhen. ""Most of the debt was tradeable on the nation's exchanges.""
Other securities firms agreed the response so far this year had been less than enthusiastic.
""There is not that much interest in the (non-tradeable) offer this year,"" said an official at China Southern Securities. ""I am not very optimistic about the outcome.""
A Finance Ministry official denied there were problems with the sales, which began on March 1.
""I am satisfied with the outcome so far,"" the official told Reuters. ""We have until October to complete the sales.""
The bonds are offered through bank underwriting syndicates, and analysts said that if the banks have to keep too much of the debt on their own books, they are unlikely to be enthusiastic about next year's issue.
The trend was particularly marked in southern China where economic development has outpaced the rest of the country, giving investors more types of investment vehicles to choose from.
An official at the state-run Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Shenzhen branch described the response to the offer in the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong as poor.
Some analysts said the problem lay elsewhere. ""The interest rate is the real problem,"" said Zhao Xiaoyun, an analyst at China Securities Co.
Zhao said bond interest rates were unable to match the returns available on the stock market. Domestic A shares in Shanghai have gained 40 percent since the start of the year.
The 1997 state offer includes two-, three- and five-year debt carrying interest of 8.64 percent, 9.18 percent and 10.17 percent. This is 0.72, 0.92 and 1.17 percentage points higher than the interest paid on bank time deposits of corresponding periods.
In the recent past, interest on bonds has been 1.5 to two percentage points higher than equivalent bank rates. But analysts said China may not want to widen the spread between time deposits and bonds too much. The banks may underwrite the debt but they are not eager to see their deposits drawn away by higher interest bonds.
That could mean the best option for the state is to issue debt that can be traded and attracts institutional investors.

WilliamKazer,"A Chinese ideologue known for his strictly orthodox Marxist views denied on Tuesday that he was the author of two essays critical of China's reforms.
Deng Liqun, 81, a former Communist Party propaganda chief and secretary to Chairman Mao Zedong, said the author of two articles that have become known as ""The 10,000 Word Essay"" was Li Yanming.
""I didn't write the essay, it was Li Yanming,"" Deng told reporters. He did not further identify Li Yanming and gave no Asked whether he supported Li's views in ""The 10,000 Word Essay"" that has sparked widespread behind-the-scenes debate, he smiled and shrugged and said: ""He wrote what was on his mind.""
Deng was attending an economic summit in Beijing that was assessing the business climate in China, with a heavy emphasis on the successes of the reform programme launched in 1979 by Deng Xiaoping to eliminate stultifying Stalinist-style planning in favour of market forces.
Asked if he agreed with issues under debate at the conference, Deng adopted the officially-sanctioned public party line: ""Of course. China is a very big country, it has a lot of potential but it also has a lot of problems to be solved.""
Several of the speakers at the conference called for tougher efforts to reform China's ailing state-owned enterprises, which ""The 10,000 Word Essay"" warns are suffering at the expense of private enterprise.
China's propaganda tsars recently suspended a magazine and banned articles by a leading bankruptcy expert after a lengthy behind-doors debate on the essay erupted into the public eye.
The ban prompted an open letter by a writer in Beijing questioning whether China's propaganda officials were opposed to economic reform and whether they backed the leadership of state president and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.
The Press and Publications Administration, under the party's powerful Propaganda Department, suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in southwestern Guizhou province, in August, said sources familiar with the magazine.
The suspension followed the magazine's publication of an article critical of the privately circulated 10,000-word essay, which also urges a return to the class struggle espoused by Mao.
Western diplomats and Chinese analysts have described a literary and cultural freeze in recent months amid a crackdown by propaganda tsars on publications and authors that dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare.
The president of the outspoken Beijing Youth Daily is to be replaced soon by a more conservative editor.
The clampdown has been fuelled by a call for ""spiritual civilisation"" -- a communist watchword for orthodox Marxist values -- as the theme for a party plenum scheduled for later this month, the analysts said.
Party chief Jiang is said to have distanced himself from the essay at the annual session of the National People's Congress, or parliament, last March, when he reportedly said: ""Some people say I support the 10,000-word essay, isn't that underestimating me too much?""
